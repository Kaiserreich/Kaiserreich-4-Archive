 GXC_starting_KMT_intro: "Once considered the heralds of a new, revolutionary world order for China, the Kuomintang has been much reduced and fractured in recent years. Following the death of its founder and primary leader, Sun Yat-sen, the party largely split into intense factionalism over the true successor to the Guofu (Sun's honorary title as eternal premier). By orthodoxy it was the currently acting-generalissimo Hu Hanmin. However through political machinations, he would see his position abrogated and replaced by a ruling \"National Government Council\", with Hu himself reduced to the position of foreign minister - of an unrecognised government.\n\nWith infighting reaching its peak around the time of Liao Zhongkai's attempted assassination in 1925, the party would largely have already split into \"Right\" (Opposing the United Front with the Chinese Syndicalists) and \"Left\" (Supporting the United Front) wings by this time. Almost winning victory, Chiang Kai-shek's rebuttal of the Right Wing would see the \"Old Right\" coalesce around Hu Hanmin, eventually holding the Western Hills Conference in 1925 to dictate the expulsion of the Left Wing. Ultimately embittered following the brutal beatings of former Marxists-turned-Rightists Shen Dingyi and Dai Jitao, the Right would be relegated to Shanghai in 1926, and eventually Moscow."

 #CHI_crs_party: "KMT-CRS"
 #CHI_crs_party_long: "China Revival Society (Zhongguo Guomindang zhonghua fuxing she)\n§gThe China Revival Society (CRS) is a clique formed by radical officers of the National Revolutionary Army and holds close ties with Dai Chunfeng's shadowy BIS or Juntong. Led primarily by Hu Zongnan, He Zhonghan, and Deng Wenyi, the CRS emerged as a new political faction following the First National Congress and is especially popular amongst the military's young guard.\n\nTheir ideology consists of a host of influences from far-right Savinkovism, Japanese Bushido, Maximist British economic planning, but the Sorelian necessity of revolutionary cleansing violence most inspires them. The CRS sees the complex bureaucratic nature of the Kuomintang to be the party's downfall and wishes to see the party purged of its democratic elements - with the end goal of a party led by a glorious dictator (the lingxiu). From there, they envision China to be developed into a highly militarised and equal society with the notion and ideas of class struggle eradicated in favour of a completely totalitarian and socialist nation. They look to China's antiquity and its Confucian order of old as not elements of ancient history but rather a sense of halcyon tranquillity that will eventually be achieved under the rule of the benevolent lingxiu. If China is to be saved, if she is to be liberated, and if she is to become a respected mighty power once more - she will have to be revived from the ground up.§!"

 GXC_crs_party: "KMT-CRS"
 GXC_crs_party_long: "China Revival Society (Zhongguo Guomindang Zhonghua Fuxingshe)\n§LThe China Revival Society (CRS) was a collection of radical Whampoa military circles, united in their shared sense of ultra-nationalist fervour. The failure of the leftist committee's most recent adventure into China has broken the sway of their firebrand, leaving them a shell of what they once were. Still, a small remnant of their movement remains, built around a small core group of confidants surrounding men like Hu Zongnan, He Zhonghan, and Deng Wenyi. Having embedded themselves into our military, there is a growing sense of worry that our amnesty will breathe new life into the smouldering embers of this cult.\n§!"

 #中國工團黨-激進派
 GXC_csp_radical_party: "CSP-R"
 GXC_csp_radical_party_long: "Chinese Syndicalist Party - Radical Faction (Zhongguo Gongtuandang-jijin pai)\n§LThe Chinese Syndicalist Party has splintered thanks to the continuing failure of the Chinese Revolution, with many disillusioned by the lack of progress by the Orthodox Faction in implementing syndicalism in the nation and perceived passivity in handling the united front with the Kuomintang splintering off into the so-called Radical Faction. They have called for a much more authoritarian, confrontational approach - challenging their fellow socialists as well as imperialists, warlords, and capitalists. Like many other Radicals, Zhang Tailei also went to Europe to study but became disillusioned with the main branch of the CSP-Radicals led by Qiu Qibai and Chen Shaoyu. The Guangdong branch is particularly vanguardist in their demands for social emancipation and revolutionary in their methods - advocating that the proletariat align even with bandits and thieves to drive out imperialists and reactionaries to build a true worker's commune in Guangzhou.\n§!"

 GXC_wrd_soc_party_long: "New World Society (Shijie She)\n§LThe World Society enjoys the distinction of being the first organised anarchist organisation (anarchists groups traditionally avoid referring to themselves as parties) in China. Led by the Four Elders (Zhang Renjie, Li Shizeng, Wu Zhihui, and Cai Yuanpei), these Paris-based anarchists became mentors for many prominent Kuomintang figures. Their influence was eclipsed however by the rise of the Chinese Syndicalist Party, especially as their relationship with other anarchists deteriorated and they were forced to retreat into their positions in the Kuomintang establishment.\n\nHu Hanmin's rise has given them a political comeback of sorts. Sympathetic to anarchist principles and more understanding than the actual anarchists themselves of the compromises the Four Elders had to make during the Chinese revolution, Hu Hanmin has offered the World Society a lifeline by funding their institutions such as the Chinese Labour University. In return, the World Society has provided a useful check to the influence of the Chinese Syndicalist Party, quashing the threat of Marxism to anarchist influence within the League of Chinese Syndicalists.\n§!"

 GXC_csp_orthodox_party_long: "Chinese Syndicalist Party - Orthodox Faction (Zhongguo Gongtuandang-Zhengtong Pai)\n§LThe Chinese Syndicalist Party may have been founded in Shanghai, but their home base has long been in Guangzhou. Guangzhou (often referred to as Canton) is home to considerable union activity and syndicalist firebrands, and it is no surprise that the city has been particularly receptive to the syndicalist message. The Orthodox Faction of the CSP was built on a compromise between Chen Duxiu's councilist faction and Li Lisan's union-based faction, influenced by the French syndicalist model and sharing Marxist-influences.\n\nGuangzhou, as one of the two pillars of the Chinese Syndicalist Party, has seen a slight divergence from the Nanjing-Shanghai branch. Led by Deng Zhongxia and Su Zhaozheng, tensions with the implementation of the Li Lisan line and general distance from the other Syndicalist outpost has encouraged a more independent streak from their fellow Orthodox members.\n§!"

Tan Pingshan, Zhang Bojun and other Kuomintang leaders disillusioned with Wang Jingwei's leadership began floating plans for a \"Chinese Revolutionary Party\" while hiding in Shanghai. After the 1932 Shanghai Uprising, this coalesced into an entity known as the Provisional Action Committee of the Kuomintang under Song Qingling and Deng Yanda's leadership, shifting its objectives from replacing the Kuomintang to reforming it as well as a general suspicion of the Third Internationale's interference in party affairs.\n\nTan found himself pushed to the edge of his own party and contemplated leaving it. More sympathetic to the Internationale than his peers and having prior association with the Chinese Syndicalist Party, when the opportunity arose Tan and his remaining followers migrated southwards to their new base in Guangzhou. There he has made use of his ties across the socialist spectrum, though his resentments with the RCA, PAC, and CSP have been difficult to hide.\n§!"

Rallying defectors from both parties under Tan Pingshan's leadership, it aims to chart a new direction to bring the syndicalist revolution to China. This party, freed from the shackles of their predecessors' bureaucracy and infighting, aims to bring the unbridled spirit of the Chinese proletariat to the forefront and wash away the old reactionary order.\n§!"

Dominated by the Chinese Syndicalist Party, it also included various other factions such as the anarchist World Society as well as disparate independent Chinese socialists seeking a space independent of Kuomintang control. The League's viability was always in doubt, especially with its perennial instability, but the rise of Tan Pingshan and his Guangdong syndicalist movement has allowed him to eclipse other leftist groups and take leadership of the movement. Harnessing the power of the Chinese proletariat, Tan and his revitalised League now aim to bring the syndicalist message from the urbanised coast into the Chinese hinterland!\n§!"

Operating just outside the borders of Guangdong however, is one Chen Mingshu.

The failure of the 1932 Shanghai Uprising worsened this schism, and confirmed the need for a more autonomous leadership structure in the MinGan zone. This led to Song Qingling and Deng Yanda's \"Declaration to the Revolutionary People in China and the World\", which formally announced the creation of the Provisional Action Committee of the Kuomintang.\n\nFollowing an agrarian, vanguardist strain of socialism, its dominance in MinGan has made it into the leading internal opposition to Wang Jingwei's rule. Its rural focus and suspicious attitude towards the Third Internationale has created splinters however, and in Guangdong local chapters have adopted a more urban, Francophilic attitude than the mainline faction. Still, they remain closer to Song than Wang, even if some contemplate a change in direction.\n§!"

Upon his return, he turned his attention to the plight of the poor farmers, undertaking a tenure as Education commissioner of Haifeng in 1921. Growing more radical and embracing a socialist following, he burned the deeds of the land he inherited and announced the creation of the Haifeng County General Farmers' Association. This movement, which provided mutual protection and aid for farmers in the region, quickly swelled in numbers and was reformed into the Guangdong Provincial Farmers' Association.\n\nRepressed by Chen Jiongming and gentry forces, they aligned with the Kuomintang and became an important organ within the party for mobilising the peasants for the revolution. The failure of the Northern Expedition saw Peng Pai and his men retreat back to Haifeng, where they maintained a tenuous connection with the broader network of Kuomintang insurgents. They retain a stubborn hold over the area, resisting efforts to root them out.\n§!"

Chen Gongbo has refrained from directly criticising his friend, but has retreated into the shadows as Wang throws his weight behind Gu Mengyu's wing and emphasised his left-nationalist credentials.

Becoming head of the Hubei Tongmenghui in 1910, Ju would go on leave to finance a future uprising just to return to Hubei to find that Xinhai had already started without him.\n\nFighting in the Second Revolution, Ju would help form the Gemingdang in 1914, and would return to the National Assembly in 1917 to serve as Senator for Hubei. Aiding in the formation of the Kuomintang, Ju would serve as senator of Sun's Presidential Palace; then as Minister of the Interior. However during the 1924 Reorganisation of the Party, Ju was a privately outspoken critic of cooperation with the Chinese Syndicalist Party, yet he did not act due to his blood oath to Sun.\n\nAfter Sun passed away, Ju would travel to Beijing to first pay his respects, and second, to organise the Xishan Conference with Lin Sen, Zou Lu and others. Ultimately becoming a core member of the Western Hills Clique. Expelled from the party in 1926 for his actions, Ju would have his membership restored in 1927 due to the influence of Cheng Qian. Following the Northern Expedition, Ju opted to instead travel to Moscow rather than live in the squalor of Guizhou, or the corrupt hive of Shanghai. Travelling alongside Lin Sen, the two would be elected to Hu Hanmin's rival Central Executive Committee.\n\nA notable proponent of the primacy of law and orthodoxy, Ju has seen himself commonly serve as a mediator between Kuomintang internal factions. Make no mistake, whilst Ju may be a \"Kuomintang Elder\", his Confucian legalism has no sympathy for those that would pervert the National Revolution."

Instigating the Shantou Uprising in 1910 on behalf of the revolutionaries, Zou's uprising would meld into the Xinhai Revolution.\n\nAssisting Chen during the Second Revolution, Zou would travel to Japan in light of its failure and organise the Gemingdang with Sun and Hu Hanmin. Zou would see himself appointed in various military staff capacities before ultimately becoming Special Commissioner in charge of leading the suppression of his dear friend Chen in 1922. Becoming Minister of Finance, Zou would also be made President of the newly created National Guangdong University, even writing the school's song. Agreeing with the necessity for the 1924 Reorganisation, but disagreeing with the United Front Policy, Zou would remain in silent opposition due to respect for Sun.\n\nFollowing the rapid deterioration of Sun's health in Beijing however, Zou would uproot himself and rush to the Guofu to sign his will.

To advance the anarchist cause, Liu Shifu, who passed away in 1915 at the age of 31 because of overworking, established numerous publications and political organisations, including the Chinese Assassination Corps that staged assassinations against Qing officials. Liu Shixin would carry his brother's fiery torch of anarchism as he was heavily influenced by his brother's thoughts. Sympathetic towards the harsh scene that the common people are facing, Liu Shixin, who studied in a local school, took part in the editing of \"The Workers\", a leftist magazine.\n\nLiu would truly pick up his brother's legacy during one of the world's greatest events, and it all traces back to his decision to study at the Institute Franco-Chinois de Lyon. During his two years of studies, he participated in the editing of various anarchist writings and was greatly inspired by the successful revolution in France, encouraging him to continue the anarchist movement after he returned to his home province in 1923.\n\nKeeping close contact with anarchists across the nation, Liu Shixin worked with Chinese syndicalists like Chen Duxiu before their doctrinal divergence split them. Believing that all governmental organisations are brutal and autocratic, he would try his best to promote anarchism in Guangdong through various means amongst the peasantry.

During Xinhai, Lin Hu fought for the revolutionaries and led his troops into Nanjing. In 1912 he became a subordinate of Li Liejun, and participated in Li's Second Revolution, fighting valiantly.\n\nFleeing to Japan, he joined the Gemingdang in 1914, and founded the Law and Politics School with Li Liejun, Bai Wenwei, and Huang Fu.

Seeing a smooth series of promotions throught the 1920s, he would fight in the Northern Expedition in the New Guangxi Clique's 7th army of the National Revolutionary Army.\n\nYoung enough to scrape by unscathed, Feng would fold into the Old Guangxi Clique's new army, and in 1927 would be sent to Seijo School in Tokyo to study Japanese. From 1928 to 1930 he studied at the Army Infantry School in Japan, and returned to China in 1931 to serve in the First Army of the Guangxi Army General Headquarters. In 1933 he served as the student captain of the Aviation Department of the Guangxi Army General Headquarters, and head of the General Affairs Section. The following year he was appointed deputy director of the Guangxi Aviation Department, and then the vice president of the Guangxi Aviation School.§!\n\n§YNotes: A young guard officer with a keen interest and knack for aviation, he has no concern for factional politics.§!"

 GXC_RUS_theorist: "Russian Military Mission"
 GXC_RUS_theorist_desc: "§YBackground:§! §LFollowing arrangements made between the Russian and Liangguang governments, a plethora of Russian Military advisors have been dispatched to aid in the development of the National Revolutionary Army and the revival of Whampoa Academy. Nominally led by Russian Veteran Pyotr von Glazenap, serving as the main connection between Russia and China, the mission aims to integrate modern Russian methods to the battlegrounds of China.\n\nOther key figures within the mission include Georgy Elfvengren, an ideological army organiser intent on stressing ideological purity in warfare, and Vsevolod Ivanov, a famed cavalry reader, writer, and noted Eurasianist whom intends to import a \"Total War\" mindset to the Chinese soldier. A nominally apolitical military mission, the members of the mission view themselves as outside the political squabbles of the Kuomintang, and are almost entirely focused on the military aspects of the Chinese revolutionary cause.§!"

 GXC_mission_militaire_theorist_desc: "§YMission Militaire Internationale en Chine's Liangguang Branch§!\n§YBackground:§! §LDeployed to China by the Third Internationale following the League War, the MMIC is the evolution of prior socialist efforts to aid the Chinese revolution. Initially consisting of Red Russian émigrés fleeing their civil war sent to aid Dr. Sun in 1924, it has since drawn officers from across the socialist world in an international effort befitting of its sponsors.\n\nThe current head of the Mission is Frenchman André Malraux, who serves a dual role of advising the National Revolutionary Army and promoting it back home. Other figures include David Ramsay of Britain, Manabendra Nath (M.N.) Roy of India, Jean Fontenoy of France, Ingvald Berentin Aase of Norway, and Jakob Rudnik (Paul Ruegg) of Ukraine.\n\nA mixture of political and military officers, their motivations are mixed. Some are drawn by the excitement of an adventure on the other side of the world, others by the tantalising prospect of fame and advancement they could not otherwise achieve at home. Some simply wish to fulfil a sense of internationalist obligation, while others have an affinity for Orientalism.\n\nMany younger NRA officers, particularly those trained abroad or sympathetic to syndicalism, are quite fond of their MMIC trainers. However, they have drawn criticism for their willingness to engage in Chinese politics - seen as undue meddling of internal affairs by many in the Old Guard. The MMIC on the other hand, believe themselves to be the necessary counterweight to reactionary influences in the NRA high command.§!"

 GXC_german_military_mission_theorist_desc: "§YBackground:§! §LRunning off of the background of the Sino-German Military Mission of the 1920s and 1930s, there has been an increasing cast of Pro-German cadets and officers educated in academies within Europe who have provided an ample landing ground for a further reigniting of Sino-German cooperation. Whilst the original Sino-German Military Mission found itself implemented sparingly in regions outside of the League of Eight Provinces, there has undoubtedly been hard lessons learned between the limits of which the Germans can exhert themselves on Chinese military-political spheres.\n\nLargely confining themselves to tacit pressure in politics, the rejuvenated Sino-German Military Mission focuses mostly on the sphere of war, bringing with them the attitudes of Germany's leading military groups; total war, mechanisation and mobility, or refinement of tried and true methods from the last World War. Either way, the renewed presence of German Officers in Chinese Headquarters may be a sign of a new dawn for Chinese Warfare.§!"

 GXC_raised_miscellaneous_taxes_and_levies_idea_desc: "In a radical move to combat the detrimental effects brought onto our provincial economy by Black Monday, our government has moved to increase our \"miscellaneous taxes and levies\" extracted from the populace, which has raised considerable uproar from the citizenry, simultaneously, this has wrought havoc on our once booming opium market lifeline."

 GXC_manipulate_the_liangguang_yuan_idea: "Currency Instability"
 GXC_manipulate_the_liangguang_yuan_idea_desc: "Our economic experts have recommended that we swiftly employ a programme of devaluation of the Liangguang Yuan in order to fight back against economic collapse, however such action has produce numerous bouts of ire and contention from the gentry and merchants, yet the broad farming peasantry supports our efforts, seeing their personal situations improve."

Withdrawing considerable funding in such critical times will hurt deeply, but sacrifices have to be made."

##Political Ideas
 GXC_struggling_literacy_idea: "Struggling Literacy"
 GXC_struggling_literacy_idea_desc: "By the turn of the 20th century, China's literacy rate reached a significant disparity with the rest of the world despite the formation and spread of modern education as a result of growing ties with the rest of the world. Nonetheless, as a region, Guangdong finds itself as one of the most literate centers of China with some reports recording that the literacy rate in metropolitan areas might be close to 80-90%.\n\nNonetheless, rural areas in Liangguang such as Guangxi continues to struggle with widespread illiteracy and it will take some serious reforms in education in order to administer widespread provincial literacy."

 GXC_shared_popular_support_0: "Unfinished Business"
 GXC_shared_popular_support_0_desc: "Liangguang has never fully recovered from the political instability of the 1910s-1920s. A revolving door of governments took hold over Guangdong and Guangxi as warlords, revolutionaries, and others took turns seizing power from one another. The defeat of the Kuomintang's National Revolutionary government in Guangzhou by the Zhili backed by German support allowed for Old Guangxi Clique warlords to take power, but their externally aided rule has been shaky. Guangdong warlords have rallied around Guangzhou, with the diminished but not fully extinguished Federalist movement enduring. Meanwhile, Kuomintang and other revolutionary cells continue to operate across the two provinces, hoping one day to return to power."

##Military Ideas
 GXC_german_advisors_idea: "German Style Army"
 GXC_german_advisors_idea_desc: "Inspired by the works of Bauer and Seekt on their purposals of reforming the military; focusing on a smaller yet more mobile forces, set under a centralised command that is only loyal to the state with each assignee set to duties that relate to their expertese. This also allows resources to be under the control of the state to serve the army during times of war."

 GXC_japanese_advisors_idea: "Japanese Style Army"
 GXC_japanese_advisors_idea_desc: "Japan, though poses a threat to China, is a perfect model to reflect our military on, concidering they're the first in Asia to beat back an European power through full force of spirit, using the might of the infantry and skills of their airforce to both follow the code of Bushido to overcome the imperialistic Europeans."

 GXC_anglo_american_advisors_idea: "Anglo-American Style Army"
 GXC_anglo_american_advisors_idea_desc: "The Americans and their English kin are admired for a reason, focusing on tactics using artillery and making stronger use of the industry to supply the armies with an endless supply of equipment and not only to mention their commitment to be loyal to civilian governments, by mimicking them, we will be able to overcome our many foes."

 GXC_divided_military_idea: "Divided Regional Military"
 GXC_divided_military_idea_desc: "Liangguang is after all two provinces and with such a unique region naturally comes the problems of regionalism due to Guangxi and Guangdong's regional, cultural, and linguistic differences that have pervaded into the military forces of the province. The Guangdong Army is divided into a multitude of regional cliques and has fallen obsolete in comparison with forces such as the Fengtian Clique in the North while the Guangxi forces have been compared to be nothing more than organised bandit clans. As long as these forces remain divided and inadequate, Guangdong's potential to bid for a chance at national relevancy are but merely a fool's dream."

Only out of this great bloodletting can our nation secure its existence and independence from foreign powers!"

 GXC_preparing_for_the_great_bloodletting_idea: "Creating Modern Reserves"
 GXC_preparing_for_the_great_bloodletting_idea_desc: "The very precipice of our nation's survival could depend on its ability to muster sufficient reserves to reinforce our divisions in times of great strife, therefore in order for China to rise against foreign powers around the world we will implement a modern reserve system modelled on the contemporary military powers of the world."

 GXC_unified_militia_framework_idea: "Unified Militia Framework"
 GXC_unified_militia_framework_idea_desc: "We cannot simply rely upon imitating the old provincial militia system, rife with infractions against the common people, corruption, abuses of power, and above all else seemingly lacking in effectiveness and capability. Instead the Guangxi System should aim for a unified organisational framework, with extensive regulation and ideological motivation. Only then shall we truly reach the new horizons of modern warfare."

 GXC_chinese_warfare_revitalised_idea: "Chinese Warfare, Revitalised"
 GXC_chinese_warfare_revitalised_idea_desc: "Our militia system is not a new invention, nay in fact it is a way of waging warfare endemic to the very heart of the Chinese people. The dynasties of old all practised our system, we have merely reinvigorated it, bringing it to the new age of warfare. Our soldiers and citizenry are one in the same, like a sentient organism.

 GXC_commissars_idea: "Political Commissars"
 GXC_commissars_idea_desc: "Inspired by the combat squads of the SZRS and the political commissars that make up the Russian Army as well as the former socialist influence on Whampoa, the resurrected National Revolutionary Army seeks to uphold the commissar model. Non-commissioned officers are instructed to lead their men in battle and in livelihood, demonstrating exceptional worth and commitment to the cause of national revolution as well as providing lectures on the infallible doctrine of the Three Principles of the People. If China is indeed to be saved, then the education of the masses must begin with the armed forces - so that they will be truly an army dedicated to the cause of revolution."

 GXC_dare_to_die_idea: "Dare to Die Corps"
 GXC_dare_to_die_idea_desc: "Salvation does not come to those who wait but rather to those who are willing to give it all, their livelihoods, their families, and most of all their lives for the freedom and liberty of China. As the bugle sounds and the revolutionary soldier rises to take his stand in this pivotal moment of Chinese history, bold and courageous individuals should seek to form dare to die corps in the mold of the martyrs of the Xinhai Revolution, so that they too can offer their lives in sacrifice for a free China."

##Economic Ideas
 GXC_workers_unrest_idea: "Widespread Workers' Unrest"
 GXC_workers_unrest_idea_desc: "Since the start of Year of the Rat, a wave of working class unrest has spread rapidly through the city of Guangzhou - an unprecedented number of workers and seamen have been taking to the streets to clamour for reform since the failed 1932 Shanghai Uprising. Guangzhou's position by the sea and its existing urban networks have already been aroused several times with notable examples being the Canton-Hong Kong Strike of 1925 and the recent 1932 Uprising.\n\nThe League of Chinese Syndicalists and the Kuomintang are no doubt behind this recent wave of unrest that threatens to envelop and disrupt the province. Each day, the tones of the protestors continue to grow more and more belligerent and only time will tell whether or not the workers decide to take up arms on the barricades."

Their calls for the various provinces to work towards implementing local self-government and then peacefully unite together into a federal republic achieved some traction, but after a promising start it was rejected by both northern and southern governments. The Zhili's successful unification by force discredited the movement, and many came to associate the movement as little more than a front for warlordism.\n\nRebuilding the momentum that was lost over a decade ago will be difficult, but the with the country once again seemingly hopelessly divided and the Zhili clique's liberalising efforts proving to be a sham, many hold out hope that the Federalist movement could be the solution to China's problems."

Furthermore, while most were autocrats, they hardly ruled alone: they were backed by a complex web of politicians, generals, economic elites, social figures, and intellectuals.\n\nPolitical legitimacy is an extremely valuable currency. While not every warlord was necessarily \"popular\", they depended on the appearance of stability and order to justify their rule and maintain their informal personal networks. As a consequences, most spent their working hours meeting with various figures from across society, maintained provincial assemblies, and donated generously to charity - in addition to overseeing executions and extensive security apparatuses."

 GXC_liangguangs_developing_economy4a_desc: "$GXC_liangguangs_developign_economy_base$\n\nThe time of the concessionists and their lackeys ruling the Chinese economy is no more! With a revitalised government interest in the economy, we are pressing forward with the aim for complete self-sufficiency in trade and economic management."

 GXC_liangguangs_developing_economy4b: "Budding Capitalist Economy"
 GXC_liangguangs_developing_economy4b_desc: "$GXC_liangguangs_developign_economy_base$\n\nAny notion of not utilising the economic opportunities yielded by outsiders is folly, for our economy continues to grow stronger with its incentivised external investments."

 GXC_liangguangs_developing_economy5a: "Heart of a National Reconstruction"
 GXC_liangguangs_developing_economy5a_desc: "$GXC_liangguangs_developign_economy_base$\n\nLiangguang itself serves as a perfect example for the other provinces to follow. Whilst not achieving true self-sufficiency yet, we have made great strides in undoing the unequal treaties and their catastrophic effects on the Chinese people and economy. Let our provinces be the model for National Reconstruction!"

 GXC_liangguangs_developing_economy5b: "The Cantonese Economic Miracle"
 GXC_liangguangs_developing_economy5b_desc: "$GXC_liangguangs_developign_economy_base$\n\nWhilst the rest of China fights over whatever meagre scraps they can get their hands on, Canton, and Liangguang as a whole, continues to shine above other provinces as the shining city on the hill in the gloom of the warlord era. May our prosperity continue forevermore!"

 GXC_peasant_and_autarkic_reform: "Liangguang Productive Provinces"
 GXC_peasant_and_autarkic_reform_desc: "With an emphasis on self-sufficiency and the peasantry, Liangguang's citizenry have full confidence that the economy and government functions for their benefit, and not for some foreign capitalist."
 GXC_peasant_and_free_trade_reform: "Reformed Cantonese System"
 GXC_peasant_and_free_trade_reform_desc: "Following our endeavours to prioritise economic integration with the global markets, and the wealth security of our peasantry, Liangguang has proven itself to be a haven for the labourer and capitalist alike."
 GXC_modernized_and_autarkic_reform: "Liangguang Model Province"
 GXC_modernized_and_autarkic_reform_desc: "The Government's focus on modernising its agrarian methods whilst retaining the national independence of its markets have led to record profits for our burgeoning economy, bound to surpass all else within China."
 GXC_modernized_and_free_trade_reform: "The Liangguang Dragon"
 GXC_modernized_and_free_trade_reform_desc: "Experts at maximising profit from both the peasantry and foreign capitalist alike, the Liangguang Government has earned the moniker of \"The Liangguang Dragon\", for its economic success and strength is that of a marvel within Asia, a true blueprint to be replicated!"

###- Phase III Ideas -###

 ##Socialist Ideas

 GXC_support_the_nanjing_government_idea: "Support the Nanjing Government"
 GXC_support_the_nanjing_government_idea_desc: "As part of our open support for Nanjing's bid for national legitimacy as well as legitimacy of the entire Kuomintang organisation, we have been instructed to endorse the National Revolutionary Army with our arsenals and stockpiles, providing material aid for the National Revolutionary Government to prepare for the complete unification of our country."

 GXC_sound_heart_sound_mind_sound_body_idea: "Sound Heart, Sound Mind, Sound Body!"
 GXC_sound_heart_sound_mind_sound_body_idea_desc: "Unfaltering resolve, sincere devotion, and utmost commitment. Let all who seek to free their country from the bullies, the warlords, the landowners, and the imperialists - raise their voices in a most jubilant shout for liberation. As long as the soldiers of the revolution are committed in heart, mind, and body to the ideals of the National Revolution, then we shall not fail and our victory will most certainly arrive."

 GXC_the_urban_revolution_idea: "The Urban Revolution"
 GXC_the_urban_revolution_idea_desc: "There are many who question the validity of the urban revolution, citing that the Chinese people have not yet reached an industrial capacity to foster the growth of an urban proletariat. However, that is merely false, as the success of the revolutions in Paris, London, and Italy have shown the true unmatched potential of mobilising a nation's workers into a true revolutionary vanguard. It is our duty, to convince our oppressed brothers and sisters in the Legation Cities and the major industrial centers of China, to rise up! We must direct the course of the revolution, to the workers, who have a far greater sense of class consciousness than the peasants of this nation."

 GXC_the_revolution_of_the_people_idea: "The Revolution of the People"
 GXC_the_revolution_of_the_people_idea_desc: "We, the common people, especially the peasants of the villages, are to blame for China's miserable position for our lack of self-consciousness and laissez-faire attitude to oppression. But it is the peasantry, that is to be commended for the spirit of honesty, righteousness, and loyalty to their own class. As they lie oppressed, they are waiting earnestly, to be led towards revolutionary glory - for when the peasantry's revolutionary consciousness is realised. To undertake this, it is the duty of the revolutionary vanguard to help the peasants organise, transform their consciousness, in order to fully awaken China."

 GXC_LKMT_ongoing_fourth_army_resistance: "Ongoing Fourth Army Resistance"
 GXC_LKMT_ongoing_fourth_army_resistance_desc: "Though failed by Chen Mingshu and abandoned by Nanjing, the socialists of Liangguang continue to resist the directives of the Kuomintang junta. Whether it be the peasant rebels of the Hailufeng Soviet, syndicalist rabble-rousers in Canton, or insubordinate officers in the reorganised Guangdong Army, their collective efforts have cast doubt on the sincerity of the \"United Front\". A crackdown is in order."

##Political Ideas
 GXC_the_public_security_bureau_idea: "The Public Security Bureau"
 GXC_the_public_security_bureau_idea_desc: "In order to secure our National Revolution, and the government at large, leading officials have advocated for the establishment of the Public Security Bureau, to quell any dissent from warlords and reactionaries alike throughout the nation, securing the stability of society under the watchful eyes of the party-state."

 GXC_paying_the_masters_tithe: "Paying the Master's Tithe"
 GXC_paying_the_masters_tithe_desc: "As good subjects in any arrangement, there is always the expectation that the subject walk to the whims of the master and do as the master says. To this end, it is necessary that the various provincial taxes and debts that the adminitration \"deprived\" the Central Government of in recent years be paid and front loaded immediately. After all, we are constituents of one national whole, are we not?"

 GXC_elevating_the_poor_peasantry_idea: "Elevating the Poor Peasantry"
 GXC_elevating_the_poor_peasantry_idea_desc: "The peasant masses contribute to the vast majority of China's population. From Xinjiang to Dongbei, and from the Central Plain to the Pearl River Delta, they toil the nation's fields, and sustain its very lifeblood. And so it cannot be an outrageous expectation that the government cultivate their sense and wellbeing. For too long have they been oppressed, or otherwise overlooked by less than magnanimous rulers. Let the Yue-Gui Cliques showcase their benevolence, and that they are arbiters of progress, not malaise."

 GXC_shaking_hands_with_the_triads: "Shaking Hands with the Triads"
 GXC_shaking_hands_with_the_triads_desc: "Perhaps an unsavoury reality for most, the developing Chinese underground doesn't only loom large within Shanghai and Zhejiang. Within the Cantonese cultural hubs of Hong Kong and Guangzhou, there too is a rising spectre of nefarious dealings. With ties to the Yue Clique, and to high officials within the Guangdong Provincial establishment, the nominally Hongmen led Triads have become something of a willing assistant within the provincial administration's day-to-day proceedings. Enabling finances to flow through government hands in-exchange for cover, the relationship has become somewhat mutually beneficial, if at the cost of the common man."

 GXC_rejuvenated_training_curriculums: "Rejuvenated Training Curriculums"
 GXC_rejuvenated_training_curriculums_desc: "With re-emphasised investment in Guangxi's native military academies, such as the Nanning Officer Institute, and the Guangxi Army Speed Training School, the provincial administration has spurred new life into Guangxi's military culture, directing it towards the refinement of officer standards, re-education of NCOs, drilling of the common soldiery, and preparation of an all-around crack force. Let it be Guangxi, not Whampoa, that defines Liangguang's military credidentials."

##Military Ideas

 GXC_prepare_guerrila_cells_idea: "Prepare Guerrilla Cells"
 GXC_prepare_guerrila_cells_idea_desc: "There are many ways that a people can fight. While we may be outnumbered, outgunned, and outproduced by our industrially superior enemies; for years the rural provinces of Southern China have grown accustomed to fending for themselves in times of crisis. As our main conventional forces withdraw towards more feasible defensive positions, we will prepare hideouts and networks for guerrilla forces to unleash unconventional warfare and to wreck havoc upon the enemy's supply lines and morales."

 GXC_republic_of_china_air_force_idea: "Republic of China Air Force"
 GXC_republic_of_china_air_force_idea_desc: "Whilst previous Chinese air fleet projects have never turned out to be anything stronger than a few outdated machines almost completely dwarfed by their enemies, the renewed establishment of the RCAF will see Chinese soldiers patrol Chinese airspace, ensuring that our citizenry never have to fear the skies."

 GXC_military_aviation_programme_idea_desc: "Reinvigorated by our successes in the Chinese battleground, we have endeavoured to conquer the air war too, forver shall the song of the Guangxi Aviation school live in our hearts: \"Airspace, China's airspace, the sky is vast and endless! Aviation, air defence, our heroes in the air. Look: The country of China is invaded, we must fight against the great powers, we must kill the enemies for our country, our courage runs through the rainbow! Come, work together, prepare, and be the vanguard of national rejuvenation!\"."

 GXC_one_thousands_sons_one_thousand_soldiers_idea: "Scorched Earth"
 GXC_one_thousands_sons_one_thousand_soldiers_idea_desc: "While we may be bested in conventional combat, we take pride in our great country's vastness. For centuries, barbarian nations have always viewed China with their lustful gazes, and time and time again from the Mongols to the Manchus, we have shown foreign invaders, the difficulties in communications and logistics the farther they push into our country. As we are currently experiencing military setbacks, there has been a growing number of voices within the military command, advocating for the intentional destruction of bridges, farms, and anything that may be of use to the enemy - in the hopes of slowing down their advance and to weather down their forces."

 GXC_republic_of_china_navy_idea: "Republic of China Navy"
 GXC_republic_of_china_navy_idea_desc: "The precursor to a modern Chinese republican navy dates back to the early days of the Xinhai Revolution when the Ministry of the Navy was formed in the Provisional Government of the Republic of China. The former Qing Dynasty admiral Liu Guanxiong became the first Minister of Navy during this turbulent period. Following the Warlord Era and the subsequent Xuantong Restoration, many elements of the Republic of China Navy fled south for the Kuomintang and Federalist strongholds, while many others chose to remain loyal to the government in Beijing. With the Chinese country finally nominally unified under one banner, the time has come once more to revitalise and rebuild the Republic of China Navy so that it is truly worthy of protecting China's great maritime interests."

 GXC_blockade_runners_idea: "Blockade Runners"
 GXC_blockade_runners_idea_desc: "Our precious convoys carry men and resources desperately needed to fulfil the needs of both the frontline and the home front. In situations where the enemy has the upper hand and has blockaded our lanes, we must seek efforts to circumnavigate and avoid their ships with our own faster ships."

 GXC_six_year_programme_idea: "Six Year Programme"
 GXC_six_year_programme_idea_desc: "The ambitious \"Six Year Programme\" aims to rapidly develop China's naval production capabilities. While most Chinese ships over the years have been either relics or foreign purchases, as part of the Nation's Military Revolution - it is inevitable that we seek to modernise our naval production standards to that of the West or Japan. By utilising the vast manpower of the nation, our dockyards will consistently be full of refitted and new warships."

 GXC_stimulated_civil_bureaucracy: "Stimulated Civil Bureaucracy"
 GXC_stimulated_civil_bureaucracy_desc: "Following the grand sweep of the White Sun across the nation, it has become evidently clear that the lowly Guangdong Civil Bureaucratic model is not capable enough in its current capacity to accommodate for the Kuomintang's newfound territory. To remedy this, [ROOT.GetLeader] has overseen an expansion in the allocation of budget towards the civil service, resulting in a flood of vigorous groundwork being made to connect the disparate administrative dead ends of the provinces."

 GXC_equalising_national_prosperity_desc: "The Revolutionary Party of the Masses cannot merely sit idly by whilst the gentry increase their wealth, and the peasantry continue to lament! To achieve People's Livelihood, and to truly in earnest showcase the Party's care for the mass movement, it is integral that we begin a programme of gradual redistribution of wealth. May they kick, may they scream, but if we are to \"become a thunder that shatters the old world\", then the old world must be brought into the new."

 GXC_bringing_the_revolution_to_the_forests: "Bringing the Revolution to the Forests"
 GXC_bringing_the_revolution_to_the_forests_desc: "As theorised by Shen Dingyi, and promulgated under his tenure as a member of the Agricultural Department of the Central Special Committee, Shen Dingyi has begun a series of ambitious land reform infrastructure projects with the aims of moderninising not only China's economy but its environment too. Drafting plans to repair the Beihai Dam, Shen has also proposed reclaiming the Xianghu Lake, and plans to enact collaboration with the Rural Reconstruction Movement."

 GXC_mass_education_efforts: "Mass Education Efforts"
 GXC_mass_education_efforts_desc: "An expert in education, and a scholar-calligraphy-educator himself, Yu Youren has overseen a broad expansion in the native Chinese education system collaborating with the likes of Zou Lu. Utilising Yu's experience in founding a variety of schools in Shaanxi and Shanghai University, alongside Zou's own experience in founding Sun Yat-sen University, and running the exiled campus, the duo have sought to incorporate these experiences to the whole nation. First starting with plans for a Northwest Agricultural and Forestry College in Yangling, it is hoped that all within the nation shall be uplifted from the plight of illiteracy."

##Military Ideas

 GXC_war_of_attrition_idea: "War of Attrition"
 GXC_war_of_attrition_idea_desc: "The Chinese nation is not that of a modern one, true, however what we lack in capabilites for modern warfare we more than make up for in terms of cunning and ingenuity. Our soldiers are prepared to sacrifice not just land but life in order to wage a war of attrition against our foes, for the deeper our enemies penetrate, the weaker they become."

 GXC_defensive_lines_idea: "Defensive Lines"
 GXC_defensive_lines_idea_desc: "Whilst our armies lack in modern arms, tanks, ships, even planes, we are a nation that has fended off conquerers for millenia, and know what great fortifications can yield. With this in mind, our soldiers prepare trench and fort alike in order to construct lines of inpenetrable defences, ensuring that our enemies will bleed themselves dry before they can subjugate our nation."

 GXC_extol_the_warrior_spirit_idea: "Extol the Warrior Spirit"
 GXC_extol_the_warrior_spirit_idea_desc: "Inspired by Bushido code, the soldiers of the [Root.GetAdjectiveCap] army strive to be like no other. Striking true fear amongst their foes, they fight with utter tenacity and ferocity against superior odds. Unwavering and resolute in their cause, the soldiers produced by Whampoa are drilled rigorously to be devout and unrelenting."

 GXC_modern_arms_idea: "Modern Arms in a New Age"
 GXC_modern_arms_idea_desc: "All around the world the rapid development of superior armaments, be it tanks, planes, or ships, have continued to engage eachother at a dashing pace. Duels occur between German Panzers and Russian T-Series models, and the Japanese similarly have developed their own line of tank models. If we are to truly emerge as a military force in the new national world order, it is imperative that China develop its own armoured columns."

 GXC_constructing_our_own_hindenburg: "Constructing Our Own Hindenburg"
 GXC_constructing_our_own_hindenburg_desc: "It is not enough that our brave soldiers and their even fiercer souls fight and clash with the foreign imperialists day in and day out, for even human flesh can give out under pressure. Their spirits may be steeled, but we can help them further. Through a combined national effort with construction magnates, business tycoons and state directed enterprises, all of China shall put forward a new Great Wall! Our very own Hindenburg Line!"

 GXC_prioritised_artillery_production_idea: "Prioritised Artillery Production"
 GXC_prioritised_artillery_production_idea_desc: "In our efforts to produce a force capable of annihilating all foes opposing the Chinese nation, we have embarked on an ambitious venture to increase the stockpiles of our artillery pieces tenfold, to truly shatter enemy defences and allow our mobile divisions to exploit the breakthrough."

 GXC_stalwart_souls_daring_minds_idea: "Stalwart Souls, Daring Minds"
 GXC_stalwart_souls_daring_minds_idea_desc: "Our soldiers ae perhaps some of the best in the world. Resolute in planning, fearless in execution, devout to the very end. Truly they move swiftly, seizing every opportunity to cause chaos in the lines of the enemy, and advance ever forward."

 GXC_fallout_of_the_kmt_yue_gui_split: "Fallout of the Yue-Gui Split"
 GXC_fallout_of_the_kmt_yue_gui_split_desc: "The Nationalist Government has divided into Guangdong (Yue) based and Guangxi (Gui) based camps, with catastrophic results. Barely maintaining the facade of unity against external foes, unification has ironically eliminated any pretence of unity, a problem worsened in the aftermath of President Lin Sen's resignation. The two rival committees issue duelling commands and directives, officers and magistrates are choosing sides, and fears of civil war abound. All of this has left the central government dangerously vulnerable to circling vultures."

##Economic Ideas
 GXC_embrace_autarky_idea: "Embrace Autarky"
 GXC_embrace_autarky_idea_desc: "The economists and planners of the National Reconstruction Commission adhere to the autarkic practices inspired from Russia's Aleksandr Voznesensky and the Supreme Economic Council. If China is to truly emerge from the chains of imperialism, then she must seek her own economic future by reclaiming her own natural resources and bounty for the sole utilisation and benefit of the Chinese state."

## Socialist Phase IV ideas
 GXC_fallout_of_the_baise_uprising_idea: "Fallout of the Baise Uprising"
 GXC_fallout_of_the_baise_uprising_idea_desc: "The collapse of the New Guangxi Clique in the Baise Uprising has thrown Liangguang once more into political turmoil. As the Guangdong Farmers' Association, the Productive People's Party, and Tan Pingshan's Provisional Action Committee struggle for supremacy as a result of the power vacuum of the province, public support and morale for the government has been severely weakened, along with the overall decrease in enthusiasm within the military ranks."

 GXC_encirclement_and_annihilation_idea: "Encirclement and Annihilation"
 GXC_encirclement_and_annihilation_idea_desc: "The doctrine of encirclement embraces two of the three principle aims of war stipulated by CLausewitz: first, destruction of the military power of the enemy, and second - the destruction of his will. Annihilation of enemy units means a reduction in the extent of enemy territory, which grants us greater capacity for mobilising popular support."

 GXC_the_peoples_war_idea: "The Peoples' War"
 GXC_the_peoples_war_idea_desc: "From all over the country, the oppressed masses of the nation stand in utmost solidarity with the great struggle against the true warlords and imperialists of the corrupt and degenerative Nanjing Government. As long as demagogues such as Wang Jingwei continue to rule, there will be no true realisation of the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen's vision for a free China. As such, we will encourage young and old, men and women, to work together and strive for a New China."

 GXC_last_stand_of_liangguangs_revolution: "Last Stand of Liangguang's Revolution"
 GXC_last_stand_of_liangguangs_revolution_desc: "It's do or die, the fate of the national revolution rests with us. As our troops continue to bravely fight on, it is becoming clear that our resources and our men's resolves grow weaker day by day as the Nanjing Government tightens its offensive against us. We have the capabilities to launch one last desperate offensive, in the hopes that perhaps we may achieve a significant victory."

 GXC_total_military_collapse_idea: "Total Military Collapse"
 GXC_total_military_collapse_idea_desc: "Despite the best efforts of our generals and our officers, a total breakdown has occurred on the front-lines with mass desertions, as our men rout under the face overwhelming pressure. It is quite clear that the end is near unless a desperate miracle can be achieved."

 GXC_prepared_for_the_long_war: "Prepared for the Long War"
 GXC_prepared_for_the_long_war_desc: "By special decree of the Central Executive Committee, a series of stringent war measures have been put in place to prepare the provinces for the realities of conflict with other Great Powers. Stockpiles of food, ammunition, and other supplies have been erected, draft rolls updated with names of young men from across the nation, additional taxes have been levied on China's long-suffering families. The hope is to have a working system in place ahead of the inevitable major war and thus reduce the jolt when one erupts, but it is naturally deeply unpopular and rife with corruption. But war requires sacrifice, and no sacrifice can outweigh the glory of the national revolution!"

## UPC Phase IV Ideas
 GXC_progressive_taxes_idea: "Progressive Tax Reforms"
 GXC_progressive_taxes_idea_desc: "The fiscal demands of running a modern nation-state mean that a modern state of taxation is needed. Part of this involves a thorough, nation-wide revision of the national tax system, incorporating a tiered, mean-based brackets for income, inheritance, and excessive profits taxes. Such a programme is bound to be unpopular among the wealthy, but it is a must if China is to survive in the modern age."

 GXC_nationalising_socialism_idea: "Nationalising Socialism"
 GXC_nationalising_socialism_idea_desc: "The DSP believes that the only way for socialism to actually be implemented in a durable form is for nationalism to take centre stage. The Chinese race must overcome the shackles of imperialism and the pitfalls of capitalism through a mixed economic system and a fiery adoption of nationalism. Private property will be respected of course, but public property takes priority. Similarly individual freedoms will be respected, but the good of the nation-state must always be in the forefront of our minds!"

 GXC_a_utopian_vision_for_china_idea: "A Utopian Vision for China"
 GXC_a_utopian_vision_for_china_idea_desc: "Chen Jiongming once wrote that \"The happiness of full equality is not the kind of false hope that Heaven will automatically bless every single soul on earth. Rather, it gives the human spirit the opportunity for regeneration. If we want to realise this happiness of equality and the opportunity for spiritual regeneration, there is no need for us to do any more searching. What we need is a great awakening of every mind so that all may be free of the prevailing erroneous thinking that 'each must struggle for his own existence without any concern for the life and death of others'...Once thought is transformed, mankind can easily break from the old life and the old institutions. Along the path of evolution, the world as a whole will find a new life and new institutions so as to reach ultimately the stage where there will be no boundaries between states, between nations, or between individuals.\"\n\nFinding this utopia might take generations, but if we can at least set China on the right path during our lifetimes, it will be well worth it."

 GXC_protecting_regional_autonomy_idea: "Protecting Regional Autonomy"
 GXC_protecting_regional_autonomy_idea_desc: "The core of the Federalist movement was defending the autonomy of the provinces and empowering provincial assemblies and their governors to make decisions on their own rather than rely on the dictates of the central government. By making peace with the various regional Governors, we can end the ceaseless cycles of conflict between the centre and the periphery and put China on the path towards peace."

## NPA Phase IV Ideas

 GXC_emphasising_intellectual_freedoms: "Emphasising Intellectual Freedoms"
 GXC_emphasising_intellectual_freedoms_desc: "Blunting the progress of hard-working students and ever brilliant intellectuals is perhaps the greatest shame of any politician. The students, writers, thinkers all must be free to explore ideas and voice their opinions, whether the government desires it or not. Science is the very root by which China will be propelled into modernity, and everything must be done to further it."

 GXC_experimental_rice_cultivation: "Experimental Rice Cultivation"
 GXC_experimental_rice_cultivation_desc: "Educated in some of the finest Faculties of Agriculture in China and Japan, Ding Ying has been a pioneer in experimentation in regards to prolific rice strains, having bred a total of 110 rice varieties, and by 1934 had bred the first hybrid rice strain with wild rice. Under his promotion, Guangdong became the rice breeding centre of Southern China, but with his methods now popularised nationwide, it is hoped that the whole of China will never have to experience starvation ever again."

 GXC_expansion_of_the_charitable_halls: "Expansion of the Charitable Halls"
 GXC_expansion_of_the_charitable_halls_desc: "The Charitable Halls, Qing Era Institutions that ebbed and flowed in significance in the Warlord Era, have been the bedrock of various Guangzhou based governments ever since 1910. Through their pressure and insistence, the government has begun to finance the expansion of these charitable institutions all throughout the nation, rejuvenating their roll of providing welfare for the needy, and at times financing local governments when necessary."

 GXC_connecting_disparate_china: "Connecting Disparate China"
 GXC_connecting_disparate_china_desc: "Railways bring prosperity. Or so is commonly believed, but there is a truth to such a statement. Without railroads a nation cannot industrialise as efficiently, and within the inteior of China, many cities and villages hardly have roads let alone modernised track. It is under this environment that the government must desperately begin to connect every major financial, agricultural, and industrial hub through the railways."

 GXC_elevating_a_new_plutocracy: "Elevating a New Plutocracy"
 GXC_elevating_a_new_plutocracy_desc: "The merchants are the true financiers of China, and it is under the rule of warlords, politicians, and revolutionaries that they have seen their status very much diminished, despite bankrolling many of their would-be benefactors akin to the gentry. And so it is under this Pseudo-Merchant government that a new plutocracy must arise, for if the nation is to be modern, strong, and wealthy, it must be those that control the nation's wealth with their mercantile skill that ought to lead it."

 GXC_glorifying_guangxi_militarism: "Glorifying Guangxi Militarism"
 GXC_glorifying_guangxi_militarism_desc: "It is the pride of Guangxi that its people are hardy, strong, and resilient. With their battle worn province and their war-torn decades fighting off invaders and bandits alike, the people have become a very model to emulate nation-wide. Passive civic militarism, both in preparation for a potential national invader, or within the armed forces itself will ensure that no matter the enemy, be it foreign imperialist or otherwise, the Chinese people will strike with ferocity and viciousness."

 GXC_reintroducing_discipline_to_the_corps: "Reintroducing Discipline to the Corps"
 GXC_reintroducing_discipline_to_the_corps_desc: "The Merchant Corps all around the nation have been comparable to nothing more than wealthy bandits; with the need to loot and pillage substituted for gambling and carousing. Without proper training, or scrutiny in recruits, the Merchant Corps soldiers are practically government thugs, and such a state of affairs reflects poorly on both business and the nation. Through refined drills, a ban on vices, and mandatory military education for some of the Corps' officers, it might be possible to construct the image of a gathering refined soldiers fighting for the people, not their assets."

 GXC_banquets_with_the_merchants: "Banquets with the Merchants"
 GXC_banquets_with_the_merchants_desc: "Guangdong's merchants are no stranger to the role that wining and dining enterprising guests or their aficionados can serve in securing a good deal or guaranteeing a purchase, and much is the same in their mercantile form of politicking. By arranging lavish banquets, playing to egos and banal flattery, the government can secure peace, financial development, and political bandwith."

 GXC_shen_hongying_the_folk_hero: "Shen Hongying: The Folk Hero"
 GXC_shen_hongying_the_folk_hero_desc: "Shen Hongying is not merely a bandit, nay, he's a figher for the people's rights, for their freedom, for the stability of the nation, and the strength of its army. Humble, meritorious, and with a personal knowledge of every soldier within his contingent of the army, Shen has cultivated this image of a wise master, a man thrust into his position due to the necessitites of the nation, not for personal gain — no matter what his physical actions depict."

 GXC_restoring_harmony_to_a_wounded_nation: "Restoring Harmony to a Wounded Nation"
 GXC_restoring_harmony_to_a_wounded_nation_desc: "China is a nation that has harmed itself in a futile death struggle between ideologies, personal ambitions, and the domains of warlords ever since the collapse of unrivalled Qing dominance in the 1850s. Confucianism, once the glue that held the nation together through a mutual sense of belief and identity, was cast aside and regarded as \"restrictive\" during the November Fourth Movement of 1919. But it is hardly restrictive, and hardly entailing for a total rebuke; to restore harmony one must be aware of their role to play and position within the nation-state, and it is imperative that Confucian tenets retake their rightful place within cultural and social dynamics."

 GXC_defending_chinese_liberty: "Defending Chinese Liberty"
 GXC_defending_chinese_liberty_desc: "It would seem that the allure of autocracy and personalism loom large within the nation. Whatever can be said of the current Liangguang government, it can at least be said that the South will always resent any form of imposition from the North to dampen Chinese freedoms and liberities. Against the Qing, against Yuan Shikia, against Duan Qirui, and against Sun Yat-sen. The Liangguang warlords have rebelled time and time again, and you'd be a fool to expect them to sit down from the next fight for freedom."

 GXC_forced_mustering_of_the_people: "Forced Mustering of the People"
 GXC_forced_mustering_of_the_people_desc: "For as long as a Guangxi peasant could remember, the soldier had always been this multi-faceted evil; to \"protect\" you from the bandits, but then impose upon you a certain form of restrictive order, or conscript you for the army itself. Whilst the Warlord Era forced plenty of peasants into various warlord formations as they were promised pay, or food, many would be demobilised into communities that would treat them with disgust, unable to find jobs or further work, and thus turning to banditry.\n\nHowever, now is not the time for reform, or the time to reconsider decades of militarism and the milieu of veterans. If the people do not fight, they must be forced, for it is not only their livelihoods at stake, but the province itself, its very cultural identity at the risk of imposition from Northerners of a political order upon which no Southerner could withstand."

 GXC_one_last_battle_for_glory: "One Last Battle For Glory"
 GXC_one_last_battle_for_glory_desc: "History is not kind to those that fail in revolt or rebellion, and it cannot be such a state that the Liangguang warlords and merchants similarly too be caste into the wastebin. This is without one final stand against injustice, and if any soldier is to put down arms, it must be by force. Death is nothing, but to live defeated and inglorious is to die daily."

 GXC_tsunami_of_dissent: "Tsunami of Dissent"
 GXC_tsunami_of_dissent_desc: "Alas it would appear that for all of the mustering of Guangxi militarism and Guangdong finances, for all of the arms and men lost, it was all for nothing. The people have turned on their very protectors, seeking to join the invading armies, and overthrow those of which they have deemed to be a worse evil. The soldiers hardly fight, or otherwise rebel and defect, and it is has become evidently clear that the time of the Liangguang warlords is increasingly becoming dissipated."

##Political Ideas
 GXC_nationalist_youth_orgs: "Nationalist Youth Organisations"
 GXC_nationalist_youth_orgs_desc: "Dr. Sun believed that it would also be the youths who must participate in the national revolution. The youth are the foundation of a revolutionary future and the spirit of the Chinese National Revolution as well as Chinese Nationalism must persist to the next generations if China is to be strong. For China's weaknesses lie in her lack of unity and if we disregard the youth - we will not prepare them for the revolutionary struggle in the future. Let us reach out to the youths via nationalist organisations and to encourage membership for both boys and girls, to learn and carry on Dr. Sun's Three Principles' of the People."

 GXC_continuing_resistance: "Continuing Resistance"
 GXC_continuing_resistance_desc: "Despite the on paper status of our nominal rule dominating the Chinese core, underneath the clean surfaces is a nation torn by conflict and opposition. Various local warlords, remnant opposition parties and intelligentsia alike hound our government and army, ultimately drastically weakning our capability to rule. No matter, their resistance is futile in the end, for all become subsumed by the White Sun and the Three People's Principles, one way or another."

 GXC_republican_disappointment: "Republican Disappointment"
 GXC_republican_disappointment_desc: "Perhaps of our own folly, many intellectuals, students and Dangwai thoroughly believed that supporting the Kuomintang would lead to a sudden, last minute, turn towards immediate democratic elections. With this clearly not being the case, many within those groups, and even our own party, are disillusioned with our governance and have begun to protest in the streets. Reassurances from the party apparatus leave nothing but a bad taste in their mouths, and it is evidently clear that actions, not words, are the necessary antidote to this national virus."

 GXC_economic_disappointment: "Economic Malaise"
 GXC_economic_disappointment_desc: "What was once a gloriously flowering economic miracle within China has decayed into a havoc wreaked disaster. Infrastructure destroyed, investments fleeing, and rampant debts have begun skyrocketing our government towards hyperinflation. In this period of grand national reconstruction, it is imperative that the Party and nation come together and cooperate to see a stronger, united, Chinese economy. One that stands on its own two feet, one that follows the principles of National Capitalism, and that of Minsheng."

 GXC_exporting_the_guangxi_model_modifier: "Sanyou Zhengce"
 GXC_exporting_the_guangxi_model_modifier_desc: "Crystalised as the fundamental organisational framework of Guangxi's own Reconstruction Movement, the \"Guangxi Model\" as it has been acclaimed is the hallmark product of New Guangxi's unique experiences in exile and within Guangxi itself. Pulling on the historical basis that lies within the Qi State of ancient China, the Xia, Shang, Zhou, Han and Tang dynasties, alongside its recent iteration against the Taiping Rebellion, the militia system is the brainchild of New Guangxi's Quadvirumrate.\n\nBased upon the Three-fold Self-Reliance policy; Self-defence, Self-Sufficiency, Self-Government, the Guangxi Model espouses its own unique peculiar form of Sun Yat-sen's Tridemist philosophy, with the militia being wielded as a weapon for the enactment of Minsheng, cultivation of Minquan, and the defence of Minzu. Constructing a strong, militarised and able China, the Guangxi Model as a whole hopes to bridge the gap between the military and civilian populations, eventually intertwining them as one."

 GXC_unity_with_the_liberals: "Unity with the Liberals"
 GXC_unity_with_the_liberals_desc: "Truthfully the Liberal and Reformist elements of Chinese society have been long held in contempt by the revolutionary party; for they have not endured the trials and tribulations upon which Dr. Sun had, for they clutch their pearls in earnest hope of the catharsis that one \"good\" warlord would bring. In this new era of a united China, no warlords remain and yet the Liberals persist. Whilst we may not see eye to eye on methodology, our shared end goals have promulgated a new fascinating relationship."

 GXC_scientific_progress_idea: "In Pursuit of Scientific Progress"
 GXC_scientific_progress_idea_desc: "Critical to the advances of society is that of the advances of science. Together in lockstep, the party's investments into science will see China progress to a new age, and with it, as prescribed by Dr. Sun in his scientific application of the Three Principles, the fulfillment of the National Revolution. For this is a revolution not built on the traditions of the past, on the folly of Confucianism and Buddhism, but on that of modernity and justice."

 GXC_liangguang_piedmontism_effect: "Liangguang Piedmontism"
 GXC_liangguang_piedmontism_effect_desc: "Premier in the unification of the Chinese nation, the provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi have received numerous special benefits to reflect their status and importance in the National Revolution. Including higher allocation of national funds towards provincial budgets, primacy in national affairs, and other boons, Liangguang has set itself as the new centre and fulcrum of the Chinese nation."

 GXC_champion_local_democratic_initiatives_effect: "Local Democratic Initiatives"
 GXC_champion_local_democratic_initiatives_effect_desc: "In an earnest display of goodwill towards democratic governance, the New Guangxi clique has propped up the \"Crusade for Free Democratic China\" coalition in various provinces to aid in developing local democracy. Hoping to progress the National Revolution towards Constitutional Rule, it is believed that the coalition will be able to teach the people to disregard the concept that military power can solve the nation's problems, and that only national reconstruction shall see the nation move past the Warlord Era."

 GXC_intensify_local_self_government_programmes_effect: "Intensified Local Self-Government Programs"
 GXC_intensify_local_self_government_programmes_effect_desc: "With the true intent of realising the Principle of Minquan, Hu Hanmin has managed to push through various programs throughout the nation mandating various local self government enterprises. Altering the psychology, leadership, education and ethics of the people, the government should strive to overcome the misconception within the Chinese people are incapable of self-government."

 GXC_civilian_control_over_military_idea: "Ensuring Civilian Control over the military"
 GXC_civilian_control_over_military_idea_desc: "Truly brandishing his sword as a capable statesman, and China's most recent face of liberalism, the Central Executive Committee under the auspices of Chairman [ROOT.GetLeader] has overseen the implementation of a variety of anti-corruption and anti-bureaucracy programs within the National Revolutionary Army. Ultimately aiming to subjugate the military truly to the whims of the civilian government, many have begun to welcome the unexpected reigning in of rampant military freedoms, even if New Guangxi holds the cards in the Military Affairs Commission."

 GXC_control_the_means_of_the_masses_idea: "Control the Means of the Masses"
 GXC_control_the_means_of_the_masses_idea_desc: "Through the establishment of thorough government control on the media and press, the Revolutionary Diarchy has ensured that only supportive government sources receive any attention, for Li Zongren has proven what the masses can do when run amok. No more shall they be tugged on by strings, forced to dance for the whims of despots. The Diarchy is here for their salvation, backed not just by wit, but by force of arms."

 GXC_organ_of_the_executive_state: "Organ of the Executive State"
 GXC_organ_of_the_executive_state_desc: "Despite our best efforts to persevere in assurances of our genuine interest and conviction in the betterment of Chinese people's future, the various warlords, imperialists, local bullies, and evil gentry continue to hamper our efforts of conducting the Three Stage National Revolution. Even worse, various socialist elements continue to rouse the peasantry with their false idols, spawning social anarchy. Through the induction of private enterprises unto official government and Party control alongside subsidising the Public Safety Bureaus, China will never fall into the haze of socialism nor into another Warlord Era."

 GXC_enforce_mass_demobilisation_idea: "Enforced Mass Demobilisation"
 GXC_enforce_mass_demobilisation_idea_desc: "Militarism, which Hu Hanmin defines as the state organised primarily for military purposes, has wrought nothing but misery upon others. Originally man organised himself militarily for self-defence, but now states have begun to set out on deliberately aggressive paths. Such an order cannot stand, for if the militarists have no target, they inevitably turn inwards. Through the reorganisation of China into various military zones, and the gradual demobilisation of the National Revolutionary Army under the Government's auspices, it is hoped that the Army will become subjugated to the Civilian Arm of the Party, and not the other way around."

 GXC_six_years_of_necessary_tutelage_idea: "The Six Years of Necessary Tutelage"
 GXC_six_years_of_necessary_tutelage_idea_desc: "Most would consider this a foolish endeavour, to process through the period of Tutelage in just six simple years, and yet for many, Hu Hanmin is exactly the exceptional man necessary to see such an ideal through. With his necessary statesmanship, and the full support of party and people, the Premier will ensure that China is radically changed, and ready for democracy.\n\n\"If a world revolution can be attained through a single ideology which can break down national boundaries, then that revolution must reflect the needs of the people of the world. If it does not, it is not a revolution. How can it be said, then, that the so-called unique ideology is anything more than a rigid formula?\""

 GXC_expositor_of_the_three_principles: "Expositor of the Three Principles"
 GXC_expositor_of_the_three_principles_desc: "The National Revolution and the Three Principles may be a uniquely Chinese endeavour, that is true. And it is also true that the Three Principles are characterised uniquely towards the Chinese Revolution, so much so that exports from the West such as Syndicalism or National Narodism presently could not persist within the Chinese Revolutionary battleground. Nonetheless, the Three Principles of the People may serve as a template for all revolution's around the world, as China's own National Revolution pertains to be one of the youngest and most successful in recent history. Working towards this goal, it is imperative that the Party remind the Chinese people of the revolutionary faith by which it defends and espouses."

 GXC_hu_hanmin_tutelage_modifier: "Tutelage Phase"
 GXC_hu_hanmin_tutelage_modifier_desc: "In essence, the phase of Tutelage as described by the Guofu follows the principles of educating the Chinese people on their rights within a modern democracy, their duty to participate in it, and the eventual introduction of local self government as a preamble towards the Constitutional Rule stage. Through the processes of local training programs for excising self-governance, implementation of Land to the Tiller, the reduction of national illiteracy, and additionally staff training programs for the party as to allow its personnel to better accommodate Tutelage, it is hoped that China will be revolutionarily transformed. Marching forward towards Datong, Tutelage itself must forever maintain a spirit of benevolence and forgiveness.\n\nHowever the Party cannot become complacent, it cannot merely suffice to fill the void of the warlords, gentry and socialists before it. The Party must stick to its mandate of six years, and under the auspices of China's Kemal, that very much might come true. For the Guofu has left us an ideology of practical and scientific theory, based on the laws of human social evolution, not that of metaphysics or materialism."

 GXC_democratic_awakening: "Democratic Awakening"
 GXC_democratic_awakening_desc: "With the seizing of the levers of power by the more democratic elements of the KMT, the boisterous chorus of cries clambering for the democratisation of the state have been emboldened, and continue to grow ever louder, seriously hampering the new government's capacity to maintain the daily functions of the state."

 GXC_warlord_intransigence: "Warlord Intransigence"
 GXC_warlord_intransigence_desc: "Despite on paper striving for a centralised government ruling all regions of China, in reality the previous government's position necessitated the establishment of alliances and agreements with a variety of minor and major regional warlords in order to ensure the success of its military campaigns. With the rise of the [ROOT.GetRulingParty], the various warlords continue to exercise their full control of their regional forces, slashing the effectiveness of our armies."

 GXC_student_agitation: "Student Agitation"
 GXC_student_agitation_desc: "With the increasing political activity of the young Chinese populace, many students have taken to creating pressure groups in order to agitate against the government in their desire for a system that truly functions not just to stabilise a revolutionary state, but to provide stability and welfare for every individual no matter their creed."

 GXC_return_of_the_vanguard: "Return of the Vanguard"
 GXC_return_of_the_vanguard_desc: "Considered the elder membership of the Kuomintang, the Western Hills Clique has seen a resurgence in both vitality and popularity, no longer necessitating being the minor partner to Hu Hanmin, but now a force in its own right. Pressing forward, they hope to drive home the quest for a \"pure\" party and ideology, one without influence from inherently un-Chinese concepts."

 GXC_cabinet_takes_the_lead_tier_1: "Cabinet Takes the Lead"
 GXC_cabinet_takes_the_lead_tier_1_desc: "Transferring the National Revolution from the tracks of Democratic Centralism to that of Democratic Consensus is no easy task, but through the cooperation of the true membership of the Kuomintang, those who were Sun's most loyal and stalwart, anything is possible.

 GXC_empowering_the_national_legislature_idea: "Empowered National Legislature"
 GXC_empowering_the_national_legislature_idea_desc: "It is imperative, particularly pressing even, that the nation no longer be ruled by the rifle. For the promotion of constitutional government and the realisation of democratic politics must be the primary goals of nation-building. Officialdom is not a gateway to power, but a gateway to serving the people. A strong legislature, alongside the adoption of a general culture that stands for abiding by the law and cultivating the habit of rule of law, that will be the fundamental solution for the country's decades of chaos and bloodshed."

 GXC_new_kmt_constitution_modifier: "Constitution of the Republic of China"
 GXC_new_kmt_constitution_modifier_desc: "Forming the Fundamental Law by which the Republic governs, the Constitution of the Republic of China serves to be the final step on the long road to true constitutional rule within the Chinese nation. Drafted by the Political Consultative Council bringing together some of China's greatest legal minds from within the Kuomintang, namely the Reconstruction Faction of Sun Fo, the Western Hills Clique of Ju Zheng, the Elders Clique of Hu Hanmin, and even some minor participants such as the Political Science Clique of Huang Fu, it is a testament to the Kuomintang's duty, servitude, and diligence in China's state building project.\n\nHighlighting the Three Principles of the People as the guiding principles upon which the nation should be administered, and the concept of sovereignty of the people, the constitution also clearly stipualtes the protection of the people's freedoms and civil rights, the central government's own separation of powers into five governmental organs - the Five Yuans, and the local autonomy system.\n\nOutshining the previous attempts at constitutional rule within the Chinese nation, such as the Cao Kun Constitution, or the Temple of Heaven Draft Constitution, it is an inherently progressive piece of legislature. Composed of three parts, the Constitution of Liberty, the Constitution of Government, and the Constitution of Sovereignty, it retains 175 articles in total divided into 14 chapters."

 GXC_breaking_their_hilts: "Breaking their Hilts"
 GXC_breaking_their_hilts_desc: "Considered a revolutionary political-military structure that won the National Revolutionary Army its greatest victories, the time of Whampoa's political indoctrination, focus on martial spirit and developing radicalism has run its course. With the nation united, and the radical alumni of the academy alongside nefarious warlord cliques in strong opposition to [ROOT.GetLeader], it has been deemed necessary to excise indoctrination. For all it is worth, loyalty to ideology pales in patriotism and fervent nationalism for one's country, regardless of creed."

 GXC_flourish_of_the_liberals: "Flourish of the Liberals"
 GXC_flourish_of_the_liberals_desc: "Whilst once considered a spent force within the Kuomintang, the Liberal forces of the Reconstruction Faction have proven all naysayers wrong. With its great success, many are flooding to its ranks, in the hopes of eventual Chinese democracy, sooner, rather than later. Endowed with newfound passion, vigour, and purpose, the Reconstruction Faction shall surely see the conclusion of the National Revolution, for Tutelage is merely a matter of time."

 GXC_revolution_by_the_railway: "Revolution by the Railway!"
 GXC_revolution_by_the_railway_desc: "Driven forward from experiences garnered from his father, and his tenure as Minister of Railways, it has become increasingly clear to [ROOT.GetLeader] that national prosperity and the National Revolution can only be brought to fruition through infrastructure. Without infrastructure, would Britain have ruled the waves? Would Germany have found their place in the sun? Would American have tamed the west? It is time for China's own poverty to be solved by the train!"

 GXC_consolidation_of_the_bureaucracy: "Consolidation of the Bureaucracy"
 GXC_consolidation_of_the_bureaucracy_desc: "Ostensibly an authoritarian party, the Kuomintang is rife with opposition to our more liberal minded outlook. To undo this, we have begun to embark on a gradual reorganisation of the party and government. Reshuffling ministers and appointees, it is hoped that the nation shall be a government free of bureaucratic evils. For China to achieve a democratic system, it must first have wise political leadership capable of enabling China and its people to move towards the goal of democratic politics."

 GXC_demonstrating_the_democratic_spirit_modifier: "Local Democratic Elections"
 GXC_demonstrating_the_democratic_spirit_modifier_desc: "The Kuomintang adheres to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's beliefs that the rights of the people are the ability to exercise election, recall, referendum, and initiative. These rights must, however, be trained and taught by the Party, under the leadership of the Kuomintang and the creation of local governments with the help of the Party - can such a democracy flourish?

#UPC Phase V Ideas

 GXC_unprecedented_financial_strain_idea: "Unprecedented Financial Strain"
 GXC_unprecedented_financial_strain_idea_desc: "Hardly a strong economy at the best of times, the Chinese economic situation has entered a far more dire doom-spiral than has ever been witnessed before. Compounded with financial insecurities, foreign debt repayments, the fleeing of businesses and currency, economic devastation, refugees, and a whole plethora of other issues, the Federal Government has been dealt with a particularly poor hand. Only under concerted economic recovery efforts could they possibly weather the storm, but it remains to be seen if Federal politics will intervene in such matters."

 GXC_the_military_dilemma_idea: "The Military Dilemma"
 GXC_the_military_dilemma_idea_desc: "Whilst presumed to be an ultimately reasonable stance for any functioning form of military, the Federalist Government's announcement of its grand centralisation and nationalisation programme has sent the establishment into a frenzy. Warlords and Provincial Autonomist extremists have joined together to campaign against the reduction of provincial forces, and the integration of their militaries into the National Defence Army. Under normal circumstances, the Central Government would be able to power through, but the opposition of the Pro-Autonomist Federalists has proven to make the so-called \"Military Dilemma\" into quite the hurdle indeed."

 GXC_a_nation_without_its_leader_idea: "A Nation Without Its Leader"
 GXC_a_nation_without_its_leader_idea_desc: "Chen Jiongming has long been the spiritual, and literal, flagbearer of the Guangdong Federalist movement since its inception. Having propelled his movement from the province to the nation, the very government has hinged upon his force of personality and connections in order to sustain itself, both financially, and politically. Yet with the recent announcement of his retirement, the political scene has been sent into chaos, and the bureaucracy similarly. And yet his actual political power has largely rested irrelevant in regards to the fearmongering and concern over the nation losing its much respected \"Father\". Evidently, Chen is leaving large shoes to fill..."

 GXC_reinvigorated_five_year_plan_idea: "Reinvigorated Five Year Plan"
 GXC_reinvigorated_five_year_plan_idea_desc: "Witnessed within various socialist and other state-directed economies is that of the concept of the Multi-Year Plan. Whilst a novel concept within China, largely at the mercy of foreign markets or native capitalists, the power granted with the unification of the nation has allowed the government to pursue a rather ambitious Five Year Plan of their own. Through the implementation of austerity, autarkic trade policies, and the creation of collective farms in the barren frontiers beyond the Great Wall, it is hoped the nation will transform rapidly. In 10 years a village will evolve to a city, and in another 10 it will turn into an international economic centre. From Shanghai to Dihua, all of China will be an industrial powerhouse."

 GXC_rule_of_the_democratic_literati_0: "Rule of the Democratic Literati"
 GXC_rule_of_the_democratic_literati_0_desc: "The intellectuals of China have proven themselves to be the true descendents of the Scholar-Official. Despite the abolishment of the Scholarly Exam in the twilight of the Qing Dynasty, their intellectual tradition carried forward into the budding students of the time, who are now the leading writers and politicians of today. The \"historic mission\" of acting as arbiters or reason and morality; the conscience of society, and the only sector of the population with honoruable aspirations; it is the modern intellectual class' duty to uphold these virtues. Through their cooperation with the rural masses, China shall excise all exploitative landlords, all evil gentry, and all corrupt officials. And without the need for violent revolution."

 GXC_a_new_workers_utopia: "A New Worker's Utopia"
 GXC_a_new_workers_utopia_desc: "Under the new government, Chinese labour rights have finally seen their due recompense. With a guarantee of a minimums tandard of living, releif to war refugees, improved facilities for soldiers, civil servants, and teachers, the nation has sought to further expand the welfare state. Instituting a minimum wage scale, an eight hour work day, plans for public health facilities and a broad insurance programme against all manners of ailment, the reformist parties have won a great victory for the Chinese proletariat."

 GXC_in_pursuit_of_the_federalist_ideal: "In Pursuit of the Federalist Ideal"
 GXC_in_pursuit_of_the_federalist_ideal_desc: "The first iteration of the Federalist movement sought a plethora of lofty goals for the nation to fulfill: abolition of provincial and local military governments, demobilisation of the autonomous armies of the provinces, and the establishment of autonomous regional governments under civil control. It is under these slew of demands that various Federal Constitutional projects around the nation emerged, attempt to wrest control from military strongmen and the corrupt national government, and restore it to provincial civilian rule.\n\nUtilising grassroots civic mobilisation, the Federalist movement was ultimately nourished by the failures of central government efforts to both unify and centralise the nation. Bearing no fruit, ideological theorists such as Zhang Shizhao and Zhang Taiyan emerged to cultivate the concept of a Federalist Ideal. Whilst the further interpretation of their ideas ranged far and wide, the ideal remained largely the same: the sovereignty of the people belongs in the establishment of autonomous provinces operating according to their own constitution.\n\nIt is this ideal that we strive for, and hell hath no fury, neither domineering centralist demagogues nor idling militarists shall rip apart the movement ever again. Uniting Liberals, Socialists, Constitutionalists all under one umbrella, and through the good will of the National Army, Federalism shall see its spotlight yet."

 GXC_the_steady_hand_at_the_wheel: "The Steady Hand at the Wheel"
 GXC_the_steady_hand_at_the_wheel_desc: "Revolutionaries, ingrates, militarists, warlords, bandits, and all other sorts of nefarious individuals would see the nascent Chinese democracy squandered under the force of their arms or postering. Having almost sunk the nation into despotism, it was only the brave men of the Yue Clique that managed to swoop in during the Witching Hour, and secure China's Democracies from falling into the clutches of autocracy once more. The measures the government is to implement to further shield the masses may be extreme, but any sacrifice is worth the cost for the preservation of the democratic dream."

 GXC_vanquishing_the_overly_ambitious: "Vanquishing the Overly Ambitious"
 GXC_vanquishing_the_overly_ambitious_desc: "Democracies biggest threat is perhaps its self-purported biggest vanguard. For all of their haranguing about the vigilance and defence of the democratic state, the Yue Clique has become nothing more than a replacement for the Beiyang Warlords that the people had worked so hard to overthrow. Through the collaboration with other conspirators from once diminished cliques such as the Old Guangxi and New Guangdong Cliques, it is hoped that the promotion of non-Yue Clique officers to senior positions will see the defanging of the Yue viper, but ultimately only time will tell..."

 GXC_UPC_multi_partisan_democracy_modifier: "Multi-Partisan Chinese Democracy"
 GXC_UPC_multi_partisan_democracy_modifier_desc: "The testament to the ultimate pursuit of idealism from the Chinese Southwest Federalist movement is that of its innovative brand of Multi-Partisan Democracy. Building upon the grassroots mobilisation of intellectuals from the 1920s and 30s, the Federalist movement thrived and was nourished due to the lack of stability in the wake of the Zhili collapse. With every Chinese province composing their own provincial constitution on the hopes of practicing local democracy and civi rights, the national constitution has become a composite of the provincal whole.\n\nBringing together democratic socialists, neo-confucian intellectuals, infamous liberals, traditional scholars, warlords, gentry, merchants, bourgeoisie and proletariat, the Federalist movement is truly an all encompassing movement of many shades, all brought together through idealistic, or perhaps opportunistic, interpretations of the new Chinese future. Undergoing perhaps the only truly peaceful and civilian transfer of power under the urge of popular election, the Federal Republic has already set itself apart from its Beiyang predecessors."

 GXC_absolute_freedom_in_education_idea: "Absolute Freedom in Education"
 GXC_absolute_freedom_in_education_idea_desc: "There must be absolute freedom in that of teaching and research! The government cannot place a dampening upon the flourishing intellectual scene within the nation, nor may it squabble the rights of civic democracy. Through a thorough guarantee of teachers to perform their duties and enter the educational profession, the prohibition of the existence of any political party or organisation in educational and cultural institutions, and the provision of equality of educational opportunities for all of the masses, it is hoped that the decades of Chinese illiteracy will be far behind the nation, and that a resilient democratic spirit may manifest within its people."

 GXC_rumours_of_a_military_plot_idea: "Rumours of a Military Plot"
 GXC_rumours_of_a_military_plot_idea_desc: "With opposition to the growing decay of the establishment Yue administration growing ever stronger, it is has become nigh insurmountable; opposition is growing like weeds, and the Yue Army can hardly cease the development of military insubordination, and even that of a potential coup. It is not merely the China Democratic League fostering dissent either, warlords have flocked to their ranks due to army nationalisation, and various members of the Public Intest Party and Yue Clique have even begun to break ranks, ultimately inflaming the chaos."

 GXC_on_the_verge_of_failure_idea: "On the Verge of Failure"
 GXC_on_the_verge_of_failure_idea_desc: "With the conclusion of the unification of the nation, it was expected that the Federal Project would be enunciated under stable conditions by which neither overwhelming zeal nor immense cynicism would dampen progress. Alas, with a heavy military hand still present throughout the political process, many have begun to cast doubts on if the so-called promise of \"Democracy\" in the Federal Project will come to pass, or if it'll merely be the cyclical repetition of the Beiyang Republic; dominated by military strongmen."

 GXC_the_national_army_commission: "The National Army Commission"
 GXC_the_national_army_commission_desc: "As advocated by members of the cabinet and political arena, a National Army Commission has been instituted nationwide as an entity under the Ministry of Internal Affairs. With the ultimate aim of inter-party collaboration and coordination, the commission serves to reduce the size of the armed forces to a mere national defence level from the ballooned size of the Warlord Era, and as a result lessening the financial burden on the state. It also serves a dual functionality: finally nationalising the military, and vetting all appointments so as to ensure loyalty to the incumbent government."

 GXC_the_national_army_commission_2: "Ministry of National Security"
 GXC_the_national_army_commission_2_desc: "With the further extension of the state of Martial Law under Marshal-President Ye Ju, the government has deemed it fit to transform the National Army Commission into a Ministry of the government itself. Tasked with the maintenance of all Public Security bureaus within the nation, the National Security Bureau works closely with the military to ensure dissent is squashed as swiftly as possible, and that the maintenance of harmony and order perseveres throughout the nation."

 GXC_alms_to_the_veterans_idea: "Alms to the Veterans"
 GXC_alms_to_the_veterans_idea_desc: "China has laboured, bled, and sacrified all throughout the 20th century. And yet it perhaps reached a particularly devastating point from the conclusion of the Wars of Unification, and the Second Sino-Japanese War. Under these conditions, there has developed a vast social class of veterans and those disenfranchised by military devastation that so desperately necessitate attention; their alms to aid in their living of a normal life. And it is the duty of the government to provide any assistance it can to its brave fighters."

 GXC_working_towards_the_federalist_ideal: "Working Towards the Federalist Ideal"
 GXC_working_towards_the_federalist_ideal_desc: "The Federalist Ideal, that of a Constitutional, Free, and Democratic Federal Republic is not dead. Nay, in-fact the legacy of Chen Jiongming springs forth a new reinvigorated struggle towards achieving such an ideal. The people and political opposition may have proven their volatile nature can saddle democracy in its infancy, but surely that cannot dissuade the Yue Clique from continuing to persevere towards this ever ephemeral ideal? Guiding all other parties and politicians, the Public Interest Party and Yue Clique must set the example to follow, so that in the future the people may rejoice in their functioning democracy."

 GXC_rejuvenation_of_chinese_culture: "Rejuvenation of Chinese Culture"
 GXC_rejuvenation_of_chinese_culture_desc: "Man's spirit is perhaps attached to the very prosperity of the state as a whole. If one's spirit enters into a malaise, it is all but assurance of his defeat. Similarly, the nation's spirit and culture is integral to its continued morale and prosperity. China has experienced untold strife and struggle as of the recent Century of Humiliation, but one cannot stay downtrodden forever! China as a nation has existed for thousands of years, and it will continue to do so, for as long as the people remain convinced and prideful in Chinese culture."

 GXC_revising_democracy_idea: "Revising Democracy"
 GXC_revising_democracy_idea_desc: "Tutelage of the Party-State as prescribed by Dr. Sun Yat-sen is inherently a flawed system, it is undemocratic, and as such is different from the democratic system by which it is supposed to establish under Constitutional Rule; and so how can the people be expected to practice democracy? Only under \"Revisionist Democracy\" may the nation truly train the masses to cultivate a democratic spirit. To be \"Revisionist\" is to take the concept of a Western Liberal Democracy, and relate it to the conditions at hand within China. By amending its shortcomings caused by unbridled capitalism and rampant individualism, the whole nation shall be strengthened."

#NPA Phase V Ideas
 GXC_NPA_popular_support_unbridled_modernisers: "Political Legitimacy: §gUnbridled Modernisers§!"
 GXC_NPA_popular_support_unbridled_modernisers_desc: "The popular image of a warlord is that of an arbitrary tyrant: a cruel, uneducated autocrat with little regard to human life, ceaseless avarice, and surrounded by a decadent court of vice and yesmen. The reality is much more nuanced. Many warlords were well-educated and kept up to date with international political trends, and while most had a ruthless streak, that was hardly uncommon in China. Furthermore, while most were autocrats, they hardly ruled alone: they were backed by a complex web of politicians, generals, economic elites, social figures, and intellectuals.\n\nHaving relied upon the Jingxing Society to substitute their political policy plan, the Old Guangxi Clique power struggle following Marshal Shen Hongying's death resulted in the once subordinate Society ousting the Warlords, and reconfirming the primacy of suits and ties over rifles and sabres. Inspired by the progress of the world hegemons in Europe, the Jingxing Society hopes that cross-cooperation between Eastern culture, history, and tradition in conjunction with Western industrialisation, science, and art, will bring a new era unto the Chinese Republic. Furthermore, President Zhu Jiahu's preference for student freedoms and academic autonomy has brought forward a refreshed and youthful visage to the Five Races Under One Union."

Furthermore, while most were autocrats, they hardly ruled alone: they were backed by a complex web of politicians, generals, economic elites, social figures, and intellectuals.\n\nStraddling the line between warlordism, reformism, and revolution, the Old Guangxi Clique reflects a myriad of narratives about its governance, and its outlook. Ruthless plunderers and bandits, but at the same time upholders of Republican ideals and the democratic notion of the Xinhai Revolution. A rival to Lu Rongting, a comprador of the Zhili Clique, and having constructed his own ingenious faction of the Old Guangxi Clique, Shen Hongying's legacy is that of much of the same; warlords dominating the organs of office under the notion of continued stability, and continued economic progress."

Ruthless plunderers and bandits, but at the same time upholders of Republican ideals and the democratic notion of the Xinhai Revolution. Chosen as the heir of the famous Lu Rongting, Lu Yuguang has adhered to the notion of stability and Confucian statesmanship that the Zhili had once propagated. Working in tandem with his adopted brother, Ma Ji, the duo have chosen to tread the path of caution, yet simultaneously strongman brinkmanship. President at a young age, China will be stable for as long as the Young Marshal of the South is breathing."

Furthermore, while most were autocrats, they hardly ruled alone: they were backed by a complex web of politicians, generals, economic elites, social figures, and intellectuals.\n\nStylish, wealthy, and ever relentlessly ambitious, the one-time Mayor of Guangzhou and face of the Chinese Merchant's political ambitions, Chen Lianbo is many things. Equally so, he is heavy-handed, willing to force through the Merchant government that he desires without a second thought. However, ruling through a nominally democratic mandate, the allusion and faint light of democracy remains an ever present ember within Chen's Chinese republic, even if the foreboding atmosphere of elitist British-inspired Cantonese democracy looms very large indeed."

 GXC_NPA_popular_support_apostles_of_democracy_desc: "The popular image of a warlord is that of an arbitrary tyrant: a cruel, uneducated autocrat with little regard to human life, ceaseless avarice, and surrounded by a decadent court of vice and yesmen.

Furthermore, while most were autocrats, they hardly ruled alone: they were backed by a complex web of politicians, generals, economic elites, social figures, and intellectuals.\n\nAll throughout the Warlord Era, various political associations, cliques, and groups have waxed and waned in their influence. From controlling the Presidency to being reduced to irrelevancy, the capacity for a group to persist throughout the long decades of turmoil and strife is but a testament to either its fluidity, openness, or principle. For Political Science, it is ultimately a mixture of all three. Nonetheless, once again controlling the avenues of the executive and legislative office, the Political Science Clique has brought forward a Third Party democratic front to the Beiyang Republic. One hoping to bring elitist patrician liberalism to China, in order to cultivate future democracy."

 GXC_relentless_military_regionalism_1: "Relentless Military Regionalism"
 GXC_relentless_military_regionalism_1_desc: "As a result of the inherent nature of the unification wars and the extensive reliance upon warlord forces, alongside the relentless promotion of regional autonomy rights, the nascent Chinese Republican Government has become saddled with a catastrophic issue of their own making. The warlords, both new and old, have begun to corner off their domains of territory from the intrigues of the Central Government, substituting what should have been national unification with a mere facade of unity on the surface. Ignoring Central Government directives, tax payments, and relentlessly opposing initiatives to centralise the provinces or otherwise the military, the Warlords have seemingly become beholden to one indomnitable fact: if they are to keep their wealth, power, and influence, then they very well might have to take up arms against the new government itself."

 GXC_deteriorating_financial_sector_1: "Deteriorating Financial Sector"
 GXC_deteriorating_financial_sector_1_desc: "Due to decades of corruption, economic imperialism from foreign powers, unstability due to national states of crisis, disunity, and civil war, alongside a plethora of other factors, the Chinese economy is, suffice to say, in a rather poor state. Investors have shirked potential opportunities, hyperinflation has resulted in a worthless currency, bandits continue to raid any remaining domestic commerce or agrarian activities. Ever present issues continue to raise their head, such as the consistent dilemma of land reform, and cross-provincial economic integration; with local communities even pressing for immediate economic relief, compromising with the nation's recent unification. What is for certain, is that the nation necessitates stable economic management, and national reconstruction."

 GXC_the_democratic_cordon_sanitaire: "The Anti-Democratic Cordon Sanitaire"
 GXC_the_democratic_cordon_sanitaire_desc: "Despite claims of fighting for the republican values and virtues of the Xinhai Revolution, the advancements in national democracy have been anything but as comparable to the lofty ideals of China's various democrats. Plenty of positions, from the Minister to the Magistrate have been granted not too those most meritorious, or those elected, but those within \"the family\" of the responsible incumbent administration. In areas without Central Government oversight, corruption remains the supreme order of the day, with the patchwork of unofficial overlordship representing that of Feudal structures in nature. Few would believe in the allusions that the new Chinese Republic holds any essence of democracy, and already the various democratic groups have begun their against a perceived \"Anti-Democratic Cordon Sanitaire\" of the new government."

 GXC_reaffirming_professionalism: "Reaffirming Professionalism"
 GXC_reaffirming_professionalism_desc: "What was once a motley crew of disparate warlord forces, now a bloated, ineffective, and highly protective \"national\" army; the Republic's army is, much akin to its domestic dynamics, a patchwork of Central Army units intermixed with divisions from warlord forces. Nominally claiming to serve the Commander-in-Chief, frequent occurrences of insubordination would prove otherwise. As such, it has become drastically necessary, not only for the army's effectiveness on the field but for the stability of China, that the Ministry of Military affairs reconfirm commitments to the apolitical nature of the military office, rework military academy curriculums, and disbandit all forces with bandit origins. But the task is most certainly not easy, as proclamations of sincere duty to service, sacrifice, and nationhood matter little to those without the elan to sustain them."

 GXC_zenith_of_chinese_capital_idea: "Zenith of Chinese Capital"
 GXC_zenith_of_chinese_capital_idea_desc: "With direct access to the executive office, the Chinese Merchant and Business class have truly asserted themselves at the height of their role within the nation. Now an integral function of Chinese reconstruction, the endeavouring Chinese capitalists have become one of the most adhered to voices within the nation. Overseeing bounding economic progress and ever increasings profits after decades of war and bloodshed, the businessmen of China are architects of the nation's renewal, financiers of its military consolidation, and negotiators of its financial independence."

 GXC_rule_of_the_iron_willed: "Rule of the Iron Willed"
 GXC_rule_of_the_iron_willed_desc: "There is no room in government for those lacking in the qualities of chivalry, charisma, or decisiveness. Only those of iron wills, those who have fought either in the battlefields or the high offices are worthy of being entrusted with national leadership. To steer China onto a new dawn requires conviction, courage, and bravery. And these virtues are exemplified in the halls of the new Central Government. Whilst issues of dissent, disagreement, or corruption may make its way to the news outlets, the overwhelming presence of a national front of bureaucrats and technocrats dissuades any advancing perceptions of supposed weakness."

 GXC_pursuing_new_policy: "Pursuing New Policy"
 GXC_pursuing_new_policy_desc: "Under the initiative of Zhu Jiahua, the Beiyang Republic has begun to increasingly import European political scientists, researchers, professors, and businessmen, with the ultimate aim of implement the President's ambitious \"New Policy\" campaign. Seeking to synthesise Western advancements in scientific, economic, and industrial fields with that of Eastern culture, tradition, and nationalism, the \"New Policy\" campaign has also revived an international interest in Sinology. Already, various foreign governments have sought to assist, invest, or otherwise aid the Chinese revival, and it awaits to be seen if Zhu's gambit, one that will surely last decades, is enough to revitalise a wounded nation."

 GXC_order_and_progress_idea: "Order and Progress"
 GXC_order_and_progress_idea_desc: "Little politics, much administration. The role of the Central Government is not to become a slave to ideology, or to personalist strongmen, or even to intellectuals, monarchs, or scholars. Ensuring economic progress, no matter the price paid, will ensure that China is forever a strong nation. No longer shall the Chinese bask in a Century of Humiliation. Pursuing the policy of a Carrot and Stick, the people will be ensured happy lives and fulfilling careers, as long as they toe the line with the incumbent government."

 GXC_the_gentlemans_republic: "The Gentleman's Republic"
 GXC_the_gentlemans_republic_desc: "Ruled by personal agreement, handshake, or banquet, the new Chinese Republic is much akin to that of the old; politics ruled by personalities, not ideology. Individuals matter more than the perceived policy plan of a political architect, and as such national policy is highly favoured towards variety, pragmatism, and the implementation of necessary measures to ensure continued progress on the fronts of national reconstruction, economic development, and assertation of China's position on the world stage."

 GXC_the_washingtonian_republic: "The Washingtonian Republic"
 GXC_the_washingtonian_republic_desc: "So-called the \"Chinese Washington\" by his close friends and allies in the Hong Kong Media, Chen Lianbo's role as the founder of the Chinese Republic has brought scarce comparisons between him and the American Founding Father, however the government of the Merchants could not be any more different. Capital is ultimately what determines policy, and the goal of governance is almost always economic enrichment. Whilst the Merchants have spurned forward a significant amount of industrialisation, the elitist form of governance in the highest circles of the Ministries has entrenched a rather unique form of government; resembling that of Rome, or of Venice."

 GXC_the_monrovian_republic: "The Monrovian Republic"
 GXC_the_monrovian_republic_desc: "Promulgating an era of peace, stability, and political harmony, the Political Science Clique's own focus on Anti-Partisan democracy has led to a broad united front, led by Political Science, and joined by fellow third parties across the board. Having long sought to oust the dominance of authoritarian warlords from the avenues of executive power, their victory against the Merchants has brought forward a period of national calm, for the first time in decades. Always seeking a broad consensus on policy, the new Chinese Republic has begun a rapprochment with various political parties, and a policy of restoring dignity to the political office, once admonished."

 GXC_a_new_republic: "A New Republic"
 GXC_a_new_republic_desc: "Led by some of its most prominent fighters in the early days of the Chinese Republic, the new Beiyang Republic has brought forward its own unique interpretation on the annals of the Five Races Under One Union, and the legacy of the Xinhai Revolution. Seeking to revitalise the Republican movement after the ailing effects of decades of warlordism and corruption, the Young Marshal of the South and his Young Guangxi allies bring a new generation of politicians to the Chinese national office. Individuals who scarcely remember the Qing, or otherwise rebelled against it. Onlooking onto new horizons however, many of the Young Marshal's old allies with ties to the Zhili Clique advise caution, or apprehension, at pursuing total progress."

 GXC_ode_to_xinhai: "Ode to Xinhai"
 GXC_ode_to_xinhai_desc: "There could be no Chinese Republic without the brave sacrifice of its fighters in the Tongmenghui and the Xinhai Revolution, and it would be but a tarnishing of their memory to institute a new sense of autocracy or authoritarianism upon their democratic aspirations. Whilst the nation cannot truly exercise the Four Civil Rights necessary for successful democratic governance, the Central Government can nonetheless work towards the careful cultivation and advancement of the lives of its citizens on the hope, that in the future, however far that may be, China will be able to truly implement the nascent dream of 1911."

 GXC_a_moral_republic: "A Moral Republic"
 GXC_a_moral_republic_desc: "To pursue total progress at any and all cost is a foolish game; China is a nation with thousands of years of civilisation, and it is undoubtedly unwise to cast aside any and all advancements of previous eras of Chinese civilisation for the folly of democratic governance. Democracy is the will of the people, and separation of powers is the principle of such democracy. Serving as the foundation of the nation's politics, the passing of power to the people is but a certainty. However, in the interim it is crucial that the nation be ruled by Good Men, experts in their fields, akin to the scholars of old. Only by looking towards tradition, can the nation begin to move forward."

 GXC_studying_european_political_science: "Studying European Political Science"
 GXC_studying_european_political_science_desc: "As was the original intentions of the Political Science Clique's predecessor, the European Affairs Research Society, and as is the modus-operandi of the Association of All Classes to Save Guangdong and its Cantonese-British style democratic management, it is abundantly necessary for the Chinese democratic republic to be modelled upon that of the successful examples in the West. Whilst democracy has seen dire straits in recent times, various nations still exercise and respect the will of the people, consent of the popular masses, and that of representative political power through elected officials. If China is to ever be a truly democratic nation, it must but only examine, critique, and refine the methods of the existing international democratic states. Already, various officials have been sent to various countries to analyse their methods, and conclude on their most fitting applications in the Chinese context."

While Guangdong's industrial sectors are bruised, Guangxi's rural economy has been devastated by falling exports and domestic overproduction. We must move quickly to slow the economic free fall."

 GXC_raise_miscellaneous_taxes_and_levies: "Raise Miscellaneous Taxes and Levies"
 GXC_raise_miscellaneous_taxes_and_levies_desc: "\"Miscellaneous Taxes and Levies\" is a common euphemism for the Guangdong government's creative means of raising further taxes while avoiding unpopular land taxes, a product of regular government financial shortfalls due to chronic corruption and heavy military spending. With our coffers quickly running dry, we must generate a new slate of governmental revenue streams lest we face bankruptcy."

 GXC_manipulate_the_liangguang_yuan: "Devalue the Liangguang Yuan"
 GXC_manipulate_the_liangguang_yuan_desc: "To maintain our regional independence and in defiance of central government efforts, Liangguang has long had a de facto currency of its own, which has quickly depreciated in value. Vested financial interests have warned against playing games with its value, however more enterprising \"experts\" suggest we begin using various financial tactics to dig us out of financial ruin and protect our government's integrity."

 GXC_bail_out_failing_industries: "Bail Out Failing Industries"
 GXC_bail_out_failing_industries_desc: "Across the last decade, various Liangguang economic programs worked to industrialise the region, with varying effect. The heart of this effort has been in Guangzhou, and many companies (both private and government-run) are on the verge of shuttering their doors. A concentrated effort to save them and reassure business leaders must be made, lest we lose our industrial advantage over our rivals."

 GXC_pare_military_spending: "Pare Military Spending"
 GXC_pare_military_spending_desc: "As part of Lu Rongting's efforts to protect against Sun Chuanfang's encroachments and also bring other Yue-Gui warlords to heel, Liangguang has become heavily militarised. In his dogged pursuit of military parity with Sun, the army has grown severely bloated and inefficient. Much of the money flows into the pockets of the various generals and bandit leaders to keep them loyal. They will have to make sacrifices in these dire times."

#Initial Regional Military Tree
 GXC_lessons_of_the_german_advisory_mission: "Lessons of the German Advisory Mission"
 GXC_lessons_of_the_german_advisory_mission_desc: "The German Advisory Mission, deployed to support the victorious Zhili clique in maintaining control of their post-1926 conquests, has paid little heed to various provincial forces, treating them as colonial sepoys meant to soak enemy bullets for the central army. Still, our proximity to multiple key legations has afforded us a little more attention than others as they seek to protect their investments."

 GXC_consolidate_the_regional_auxiliaries: "Consolidate the Regional Auxiliaries"
 GXC_consolidate_the_regional_auxiliaries_desc: "While it would be unfair to say all German advisors have treated Chinese forces as disposable, the object of their limited affections have been the elite central army divisions of Sun Chuanfang and Wu Peifu. Even then, an oft-repeated criticism of the post-Restoration era military reforms is the Chinese army has become effectively an \"arm of the legations\", designed to protect foreign concessions."

 GXC_insistence_upon_the_stiff_arm: "Insistence Upon the Stiff Arm"
 GXC_insistence_upon_the_stiff_arm_desc: "After the end of Fourth Zhili-Fengtian war, an attempt at reforming provincial police forces was made. The Cantonese police took inspiration from American and German police models, taking a national lead in modernising police work. Continuing these reforms, new police academies must be created and efforts made to reinforce a positive public image of incorruptibility, civil order, and public peace."

 GXC_blockhouse_tactics: "Blockhouse Tactics"
 GXC_blockhouse_tactics_desc: "Many German advisors drew inspiration not only from their experiences fighting in the Weltkrieg, but also earlier colonial conflicts in Africa. To root out ongoing insurgencies in the League, a series of encirclement campaigns began following the 1932 Shanghai Uprising. Fortifying key strong points across Liangguang denies enemies easy movement, allowing mobile elements to isolate and destroy them."

 GXC_never_another_guangzhou: "Never Another Guangzhou"
 GXC_never_another_guangzhou_desc: "After the collapse of the British Empire and the breakdown of the Tsingtao Accord, the \"Shanghai Scramble\" saw escalating German and Japanese confrontations over the concessions. American intervention prevented any outright conflict, but with the United States in retreat, there have been growing concerns of potential threats to our valuable ports along the contested South China sea. The fall of the Kuomintang, after all, began with a German naval invasion of Guangzhou."

 GXC_from_flanders_fields_to_guangxis_mountains: "From Flanders' Fields to Guangxi's Mountains"
 GXC_from_flanders_fields_to_guangxis_mountains_desc: "Perhaps the only constant about warfare is that it is always changing. With another period of bloodshed on the horizon, we must work to integrate the lessons of the past few decades drawing from experiences in the Weltkrieg, the National and Constitutional Protection Wars, the Northern Expedition, and the Zhili-Fengtian wars. Difficult times lie ahead, but there is no sense marching blindly."

 GXC_adopt_battlefield_radios: "Adopt Battlefield Radios"
 GXC_adopt_battlefield_radios_desc: "One of the greatest innovations of the 20th Century is the mass improvement of communication technologies. This has allowed for Generals to command increasingly large formations and has had a proven history of tilting the scales on the battlefield. Whether it be fighting conventional battles or dealing with rural insurgencies, radios will give us the edge we need to prevail."

 GXC_integrate_provincial_security_forces: "Integrate Provincial Security Forces"
 GXC_integrate_provincial_security_forces_desc: "Liangguang has long been home to a menagerie of bandit clans, rogue detachments, and warlord militias vying for influence. Regional governments have often only asserted minimal control over these petty strongmen, preferring instead to unleash them against other governments or pit them against each other. Having faced the worst crisis yet, we must now work to assert our authority over Liangguang."

 GXC_primacy_of_the_southern_piedmont: "Primacy of the Southern Piedmont"
 GXC_primacy_of_the_southern_piedmont_desc: "The quality of Chinese armies varies tremendously. Some units are hardly one step above bandits, while others only exist on paper. Others, particularly those funded by the central government or the personal retainers of stronger warlords are more elite, though hardly up to par with western armies. In some ways this is by design, allowing an almost feudal-like security structure. But just as China must change if it is to survive, so too must our armies."

 GXC_integrate_the_baojia: "Integrate the Baojia"
 GXC_integrate_the_baojia_desc: "Local military detachments are often haphazardly organised, equipped with whatever weapons that can be easily fashioned by local power-holders and staffed by men levied from the fields and hamlets. These militias have often been overlooked in the eyes of our sneering Western trainers, but we know that if properly integrated these brave men protecting their homes can be an asset in asymmetrical conflicts."

 GXC_the_necessary_sin: "The Necessary Sin"
 GXC_the_necessary_sin_desc: "In order to finance our armies, we have been forced to export raw resources in bulk. In particular, Liangguang has made good use trading cheap Wolfram (Tungsten) in exchange for more advanced military equipment from western powers, allowing us to keep Zhili influence at bay. Continuing this trade is essential to funding our elite troops, even if one day we hope to negotiate on a more equal footing."

 GXC_tighten_the_noose_on_militarism: "Tighten the Noose on Militarism"
 GXC_tighten_the_noose_on_militarism_desc: "The decentralised, clan-like nature of warlordism has often been a source of frustration of foreign observers. Officers come and go, taking their entire staff along with men and arms like feudal times. The Germans are not too dissimilar, packing their bags and running once times grew tough. We however, remain. We shall begin asserting civilian control over the army, starting with little things like having civilian police check army officers' bags for contraband."

#Embrace Guangxi Style Branch
 GXC_embrace_the_guangxi_style: "Embrace the Guangxi Style"
 GXC_embrace_the_guangxi_style_desc: "For all of Guangxi's flaws, its people have developed a proud military culture that, if properly harnessed might save the nation. From exile, Bai Chongxi has written at length about his theories, most prominently calling for \"Three Policies of Military Mobilisation\": Merge Army and Militia, Integrate the Literati and Officer Corps, and Unify the Volunteer and Conscription System. He dreams of a citizen-army for China, and Guangxi is uniquely suited to develop it."

 GXC_literati_and_officer_corps_are_one: "The Literati and Officer Corps Are One"
 GXC_literati_and_officer_corps_are_one_desc: "Just as every able-bodied man must serve as a citizen-soldier, every student must be willing to become an officer. Bai and other military men have long castigated the student class for being pacifistic, status-hungry, and anti-militarism despite trying times, looking down on military service while whining about foreign imperialism. The new Chinese student will be aggressive, patriotic, and self-sacrificing."

 GXC_age_of_scientific_warfare: "Age of Scientific Warfare"
 GXC_age_of_scientific_warfare_desc: "A new era of warfare dawns on the world, and China must not fall behind in the art of war. Wars and war-making grows exponentially complex, and literacy among the officer corps becomes increasingly a necessity. Only civilian schools can provide literate officers in time and in sufficient quantities, so students and intellectuals must be pressed into national service. Through mind and muscle we will prevail."

 GXC_militia_cadre_academy: "The Militia Cadre Academy"
 GXC_militia_cadre_academy_desc: "Quality officers make the difference between citizen-militia and ordinary rabble. While initially decentralised training at cadre-training battalions placed in each militia region seemed promising, we have found it to be more efficient to have one central academy in Guangxi to give cadets two months of training. After that they will be shipped off to regional militia Headquarters for further training. Better officers will later become field commanders or staff officers."

 GXC_encapsulating_the_warrior_society: "Encapsulating the Warrior Society"
 GXC_encapsulating_the_warrior_society_desc: "In building a citizen-army, we must implement a training programme radically different from the disorganised warlords and the corrupt professional armies that came before us. Instead, a comprehensive programme beginning at age 17 covering both military and non-military matters will prepare young men for the difficult realities that lie ahead. Across eighteen meticulously planned months, they become a new breed of soldiers, and more provinces shall follow our example."

 GXC_merge_army_and_militia: "Merge Army and Militia"
 GXC_merge_army_and_militia_desc: "The lines between military and civilian spheres must blur. The ancient ethos of \"Unify Soldiery and Peasants\" shall be modernised into \"Merge Army and Militia\", arousing and uniting the people in one common cause \"like Switzerland in Europe\". Each county will raise and train local men for organisational use, with all men between ages 18-45 eligible for compulsory draft organised into smaller units assembled around village, schools, offices, and universities."

 GXC_unify_the_volunteer_and_conscription_system: "Unify the Volunteer and Conscription System"
 GXC_unify_the_volunteer_and_conscription_system_desc: "In Guangxi, we have reversed the old Chinese saying: \"only bad iron is used for nails, only bad men serve in the army.\" Although conscription has long been unpopular in China, we press on, shaming anyone who fails to pass conscription tests. No longer will Guangxi rely on the mercenary \"professional armies\", instead one army truly made up of and fighting for the people shall defend the land."

 GXC_threefold_self_reliance_policy: "The Threefold Self-Reliance Policy"
 GXC_threefold_self_reliance_policy_desc: "Sun Yat-sen once spoke of Three Principles for the People: Democracy, Welfare, and Nationalism. In Guangxi, these form the foundation of our principles of self-reliance: self-government, self-sufficiency, and self-defence. We can ill afford to be dependent on foreign suppliers, and must produce our own guns, grenades, and mortars. Moreover, our militias must be willing to lend a hand in local reforestation, planting, construction, land registration and census-taking."

 GXC_from_a_budding_flower_may_ferocity_grow: "From a Budding Flower May Ferocity Grow"
 GXC_from_a_budding_flower_may_ferocity_grow_desc: "Youth is little excuse for meekness. Young boys will be taught military skills, girls nursing skills. Junior High School will compose of five semesters of normal academics, with the sixth semester largely dedicated to military training including a militarised final exam. University students will be required to attend five hours of military training weekly, female students three. By adulthood, all children will have learned how to defend the nation."

 GXC_chinas_sparta: "China's Sparta"
 GXC_chinas_sparta_desc: "Whatever conceited outsiders may think of Guangxi, no amount of disparaging remarks about our \"backwardness\" or scornful ridicule of our leaders can deny the growing prowess of our citizen-army. We have fundamentally transformed Guangxi into a powerful citizen stratocracy. With widening respect or perhaps fear, our once snickering detractors now recognise the power of a mobilised people, fanatically loyalty to the defence of their beloved nation."

 GXC_mobilisation_of_the_masses: "Mobilisation of the Masses"
 GXC_mobilisation_of_the_masses_desc: "With the further advancement of our militia-programme into the newly reclaimed regions of China, the new citizens within our government struggle to integrate into the militia framework, with some even protesting vigorously. To this end, we must incentivise the expansion of the militia system with a further call to arms aimed at the peasantry, for without the participation of the Chinese people in our new model militia, how can they truly take their part in our society?"

 GXC_understanding_of_the_land: "Understanding of the Land"
 GXC_understanding_of_the_land_desc: "Those native to Guangxi know of its terrain: rugged, mountainous, hardy. Yet the people are but a reflection of the land they develop in, and Guangxi soldiers are known for their ferocity in battle. Therefore we must enlighten the rest of our soldiers in understanding the lands they grew up in, for any foe — foreign or otherwise — should know to fear a combatant in their home territory."

 GXC_heart_of_the_soldier: "Heart of the Soldier"
 GXC_heart_of_the_soldier_desc: "A soldier and their gun is akin to a peasant and their plough. Inseparable. Therefore we cannot sit idly by as the world around us modernises their rifles and helmets, for what use is a bolt-action rifle against an armoured behemoth? The weapons of our soldiers must be as strong as their hearts, for good courage deserves to be backed by strong force."

 GXC_modern_methods_for_a_new_age: "Modern Methods for a New Age"
 GXC_modern_methods_for_a_new_age_desc: "Since the turn of the century, a new age of warfare has dawned. Automatic weapons, planes, artillery, and tanks all descend unto battlefields around the globe. Yet Chinese warfare has remained nominally stagnant, with few notable attempts at modernisation of the armies. Whilst lacking in industry for proper armoured divisions, we can still integrate modern vehicles into both our divisions and supply lines."

 GXC_good_iron_for_nails_good_men_serve_the_army: "Good Iron for Nails, Good Men Serve the Army"
 GXC_good_iron_for_nails_good_men_serve_the_army_desc: "Despite the militia system having been cemented into Chinese society, there remain those who object to the conscription system. In order to rectify such a misunderstanding, we must incentivise to the Chinese people the reasons to serve, the reasons to bleed. To meet this, a new round of conscription will be called for throughout the nation. For if we are ever descended upon by any foe, they must learn that the entire Chinese citizenry will oppose them."

 GXC_citizen_soldier_unification: "Citizen-Soldier Unification"
 GXC_citizen_soldier_unification_desc: "The ever striking advance of our citizen stratocracy comes closer to the apotheosis of our theorist's desires. New militia continue to be trained vigorously, and prove again and again their effectiveness in our wars. Our soldiers continue to serve the nation, be it in peace-time or during war, a truly coherent, coordinated society beating like a living being. Soldiers are no longer regarded as an unruly, lowly class but as a core part of Chinese society."

 GXC_preparing_for_the_great_bloodletting: "Preparing for the Great Bloodletting"
 GXC_preparing_for_the_great_bloodletting_desc: "Many theorists still criticise the lack of proper reserves comparable to other modern nation-states throughout the world. Our standing army could reach innumerable heights, and yet if a Chinese soldier were to die on the battlefield, our system would be so inept as to struggle to replace them despite the adequate numbers of trained citizen-soldiers. To rectify this, we absolutely must restructure and modernise the current reserves system to be fit for our new way of waging war."

 GXC_guangxi_tactics: "Guangxi Tactics"
 GXC_guangxi_tactics_desc: "The mountainous terrain within Guangxi carves it into small, isolated pockets. Such an environment is the premier developing grounds for unorthodox tactics employed by the denizens there, and this is not any more readily apparent than in the province's banditry. Despite the modern, numerically superior foes they would face, the bandits would continuously triumph through utilisation of warfare not found within textbooks. Our soldiers will learn to fight in the Guangxi way."

 GXC_unified_militia_framework: "Unified Militia Framework"
 GXC_unified_militia_framework_desc: "Unending in the desires for expansion of the militia system, our theorists have called for a \"Unified Organisational Framework\" for our militia, with extensive regulation and ideological motivation aimed at ensuring our militia functions as an ecosystem of its own."

 GXC_chinese_warfare_revitalised: "Chinese Warfare Revitalised"
 GXC_chinese_warfare_revitalised_desc: "Truly our militia system is not revolutionary, in fact it harkens to the days long past us. There existed such a framework within the Xia, Shang and Zhou dynasties. No distinction existed between a soldier or a peasant, the army and people were truly one being. Therefore our system is but the natural order of things within China, and we have merely returned to our roots. A true revitalisation of this traditional Chinese system in the warfare of the current age."

#Building the Elite Heer Branch
 GXC_building_the_eliteheer: "Building the Eliteheer"
 GXC_building_the_eliteheer_desc: "The logical continuation of our military reforms is to do what Sun Chuanfang and Wu Peifu have largely failed to do with German help: build a capable central army to serve as the core of China's military. We must act as auxiliaries no more: if China is to be saved an army must be created to protect it. We shall build an army along western lines, continuing the stratified structure already laid out for us."

 GXC_song_and_dance_of_the_military_confucius: "Song and Dance of the Military Confucius"
 GXC_song_and_dance_of_the_military_confucius_desc: "The Germans of course made their mark over most of China, but they are hardly the only ones with an interest in the region or a proud military history. We must take care to recruit further trainers to aid us in building our army, whether it be courting formal advisors from foreign powers or hiring private mercenary trainers with less diplomatic baggage. Still, we dream of the day we will again be at the forefront of military advancement."

 GXC_victory_secured_through_reconnaissance: "Victory Secured Through Reconnaissance"
 GXC_victory_secured_through_reconnaissance_desc: "Superior battlefield intelligence is invaluable in an age of rapidly improving communications and swift movement. Careful spotting, intelligence gathering, and communication to headquarters goes hand-in-hand with victory, foiling ambushes and supporting assaults. Whether it be conventional foes on the frontline or anti-partisan operations in the hinterlands, we must secure this advantage."

 GXC_modern_engineering_corps: "Modern Engineering Corps"
 GXC_modern_engineering_corps_desc: "Military engineering is an ancient part of the art of war, and one that continues to this day. Indeed, our old German advisors were always proud of their combat engineering corps, and we too must take careful stock of our own capabilities. Tasked with building fieldworks, paving roads, and breaching obstacles, engineers are a critical support arm for any modern military."

 GXC_form_mobile_detachments: "Form Mobile Detachments"
 GXC_form_mobile_detachments_desc: "In these days of mechanised warfare, and perhaps combined with the horrors of static warfare on the Great War's Western Front, it is often easy to forget that commanders have valued mobility long before the first truck or train. Taking inspiration from the \"Flying Columns\" deployed in Africa, German advisors have long suggested smaller, flexible, and elite units capable of punching holes in enemy lines while other formations hold our lines."

 GXC_fight_without_thought_of_retreat: "Fight Without Thought of Retreat"
 GXC_fight_without_thought_of_retreat_desc: "To win a modern war, we must have a modern general staff. An capable army with an incompetent head is a doomed one, and the style of command many of our generals are accustomed to has largely fallen out of the times. We must take advantage of returning cadets from Baoding Military Academy and foreign schools to build a modern general staff, both in our individual armies and on a national level."

 GXC_thorough_logistical_chain: "A Thorough Logistical Chain"
 GXC_thorough_logistical_chain_desc: "Superior logistics have always been the key to victory in war, but rapid innovations across the last century have made it evermore potent. With trains, trucks, and an ever growing supply chain needed to feed, arm, and reinforce a modern army, a formalised and professional system is essential. Careful and centralised planning and procurement must be developed by our quartermasters, especially if we wish to send forces outside of our home provinces."

 GXC_guangdongs_troughs_guangxis_peaks: "Guangdong's Troughs, Guangxi's Peaks"
 GXC_guangdongs_troughs_guangxis_peaks_desc: "What we may not have in weapons or technology, we can make up for with our superior grasp of the land. Foreign invaders may come to Liangguang expecting an easy fight, but they will quickly fall victim to our rolling hills and mighty rivers. The transition of our local troops from regional militia to devastating light infantry may be a slow one, but it is essential to building an army capable of defending our homes."

 GXC_local_officer_initiative: "Local Officer Initiative"
 GXC_local_officer_initiative_desc: "For all the improvements in technology and tactics, the fundamentals that make for a great army remain the same. Small group leadership and independent initiative by inspiring officers win little battles that add up across campaign. Often local commanders know better of local conditions than their distant generals. We must teach our men to take charge, while still keeping the big picture in mind."

 GXC_victory_through_combined_arms: "Victory Through Combined Arms"
 GXC_victory_through_combined_arms_desc: "At the end of the day, our advisors warned us that we will always be fighting an asymmetrical war. Still, through their efforts and our own, we have found a way to maximise all the different branches of our army to their fullest advantage - the infantry hold the frontline, the irregulars the countryside, while elite mobile units act as a flexible reserve, puncture enemy weak-points as they emerge. Together, we can take down much greater foes."

 GXC_strength_through_mobility: "Strength Through Mobility"
 GXC_strength_through_mobility_desc: "The German military mission to the Zhili Clique brought with them ideas of mobile warfare, a doctrine centred around speed. While the industrial powers of the West utilise mechanised and armour divisions to achieve their needs of speed, we will achieve mobility in infantry, armed with light machine guns and trench mortars. We will seek to emulate Lettow-Vorbeck's example, and eventually surpass even his feats!"

 GXC_modern_communication_networks: "Modern Communication Networks"
 GXC_modern_communication_networks_desc: "Core to a modern army is the utilisation of new technologies. The development of new communication technologies have played a central role in revolutionising how wars may be waged, and our military must make acknowledge this. A modern military must always be following the technological advancements of the time, or they will fall behind. We will not suffer the fate of the late Qing Dynasty, we will always remain one step ahead of our enemies."

 GXC_unity_of_industry_and_military: "Unity of Defence and Industry"
 GXC_unity_of_industry_and_military_desc: "A modern army cannot be developed without the necessary industries to fuel its needs. Nearly half of German military aid to China was economic in nature, and with large swathes of Northern China in our hands, we will utilise all captured industrial centres and arsenals. Whereas the Zhili Clique squandered their use with petty warlord disputes, we will use them to field an army loyal to the republic above all else!"

 GXC_modern_railway_network: "Modern Railway Networks"
 GXC_modern_railway_network_desc: "In order to have a truly mobile army, transportation across China must be modernised. Not only will this help with our logistics chain, but more rails will go a long way towards exploitation of the natural resources in China. Connecting rails across the nation will allow us to more effectively defend all regions, and respond quickly to threats, be they internal or external."

 GXC_an_innovative_army_corps: "Cult of the Innovative Officer"
 GXC_an_innovative_army_corps_desc: "A good officer is more than a capable tactician and fighter; no, a good officer takes initiative to experiment with new and revolutionary ideas of warfare. We need an officer corps staffed with those who think outside of the box, those who can compensate for our technological backwardness and fight off all enemies who wish to dominate our nation. Let us exalt this new type of officer as the vanguard of the Chinese military!"

 GXC_formulating_a_defensive_line: "Formulating Defensive Lines"
 GXC_formulating_a_defensive_line_desc: "Despite our modernisation efforts, it is clear that China remains behind technologically when compared to the Russian bear in the north and the Empire of the Rising Sun in the east. We undoubtedly cannot hold the entirety of the country, but we will make use of the terrain and essential supply and railway points to mark areas where we must consolidate our forces for an unbreakable defence."

 GXC_the_nation_as_a_frontline: "The Nation as a Frontline"
 GXC_the_nation_as_a_frontline_desc: "While China may be lacking in extensive and modern industry, our nation is blessed with manpower and land in plenty. The enemy will never be able to match us blood for blood, and we have space to lose in the name of time. We will bide our time, pull our enemies deeper into China to overextend their lines, and launch the counter offensive when the time is ripe."

 GXC_neutralising_superior_airpower: "Neutralising Enemy Air Power"
 GXC_neutralising_superior_airpower_desc: "In this age of warfare, the land force is often supplemented by fighters and bombers in the sky. While we aspire to make use of combined arms as best we can, the Chinese air force simply cannot march the industrial powers of the west, or the Empire of Japan. We will instead endeavour to neutralise their advantage in the air with anti-air guns and even the playing field."

 GXC_primacy_of_the_southern_school: "Primacy of the Southern School"
 GXC_primacy_of_the_southern_school_desc: "In America, the best and brightest cadets go to West Point, where they are bred into capable officers. In China, the Kuomintang developed the Whampoa Military Academy in the ideals of the Three Principles and Sun Yat-sen's will. However, we seek to not construct an army of revolutionary fanatics, but a professional officers corp. We will emulate Washington's example, and forge an academy capable of producing the next Sun Tzu, the next Zhuge Liang!"

 GXC_prussia_of_the_east: "Prussia of the East"
 GXC_prussia_of_the_east_desc: "At long last, China's military reforms have developed a modern army. German military thought is pervasive throughout our new army corps, with General Hans Von Seekt's \"The Thoughts of a Soldier\" being a favourite amongst our generals. Our adherence to German military principles and restructuring along German lines have earned our military the nickname the \"Prussia of the East.\" Let us prove this nickname true, and win a victory surpassing the glories of Tannenberg!"

 GXC_supremacy_of_the_new_model_army: "Supremacy of the New Model Army"
 GXC_supremacy_of_the_new_model_army_desc: "Humiliation taught the Qing Dynasty that reform was necessary. However, sheer imperial incompetence produced the Beiyang army, a force tainted by corruption on all levels, and staffed with buffoonish officers like Yuan Shikai. Now, our reforms have produced a new army that China can be proud of, one where loyalty is to the very nation and not the purse strings. We have become what the Beiyang Army could not be, a shining example of modernity in the Middle Kingdom."

 GXC_the_legion_of_the_republic: "The Legion of the Republic"
 GXC_the_legion_of_the_republic_desc: "Much like Roman Republic and the United States, our republic stands for great virtues respected by all who live under the flag. While the Kuomintang utilised the slogans of chaotic revolutionary zeal, we stand for true republican ideals, not professed loyalty to a party drenched in autocracy. While the northern warlords fight in nepotist squabbles, our military stands for the nation itself. We will defend China, defend republicanism!"

#Legacy of Whampoa Branch
 GXC_legacy_of_whampoa: "Legacy of Whampoa"
 GXC_legacy_of_whampoa_desc: "Years ago, on the docks of Whampoa, a military academy was established by the Kuomintang with the help of Red Russian exiles with the hope of creating a truly revolutionary army. They were not the best armed, they were not the best led, but for all their failings the National Revolutionary Army became legendary for their utter conviction in their party's cause. A new Whampoa will be established, and this time its cadets will see their revolution succeed!"

 GXC_will_wins_wars: "Will Wins Wars"
 GXC_will_wins_wars_desc: "Whether it be the revolutionary zeal of the Bolsheviks, the heroism of the White Volunteer Army, or the Bushido code of the Samurai, great victories have come out of lesser armies through the utter tenacity and dedication of its soldiers. Our men was be inoculated with ideological fervour, taught in fine detail the lofty ideals they are fighting for. They will fight and die without hesitation."

 GXC_exalt_the_martyrs: "Exalt the Martyrs"
 GXC_exalt_the_martyrs_desc: "Since the early days of the Xinhai Revolution, brave young men armed sometimes with nothing but a blade or a grenade would charge better armed Manchu troops, leading the way for the revolutionaries to topple the old order. Today, as the fate of China is decided, we must cultivate another generation of courageous martyrs, the shock troopers that will irrigate our revolution with their blood."

 GXC_establishment_of_the_zhongyangjun: "Establishment of the Zhongyangjun"
 GXC_establishment_of_the_zhongyangjun_desc: "We will strive to create the finest army in all of China, and at the tip of the spear will be several elite divisions trained in the latest Western style and led by our brightest cadets. Imbued with unparalleled will and ceaselessly trained, they will sooner die than surrender. These units will be the first into breaches, exploiting enemy weak-points and turning the tide of battle under the cover of pounding artillery."

 GXC_the_renaissance_of_methodology: "The Renaissance of Methodology"
 GXC_the_renaissance_of_methodology_desc: "Slowly but surely, our men will be able to penetrate even well entrenched warlord units. Like clockwork, a combination of spotters, artillery, and shock infantry will find and pierce the weakest parts of our foes' forward defences across the front line. Afterwards, reserve units will flood through the openings, taking on enemy reserves that try to stop them, eviscerating enemy formations."

 GXC_quality_at_the_forefront: "Quality at the Forefront"
 GXC_quality_at_the_forefront_desc: "Modern Russian doctrine calls for quality over quantity. While old stereotypes remain about Russian and Chinese armies alike, what will set us apart from the corrupt, bloated armies of the warlords is the superiority of our wills and our weapons. We do not have much, but what we do have will be the best. We will train an elite army, properly equipped and led, that will sweep away those that oppose us."

 GXC_songbirds_of_hellfire_desc: "Puncturing enemy lines will require us to mass large amounts of artillery into grand batteries, able to concentrate fire on wavering points in the enemy line. Artillery is a precious resource in China, and the logistics often difficult, but with extensive training in coordination between scouts, commanders, infantry, and artillery we can shatter even some of the best fortified enemy lines."

 GXC_constituting_tradition: "Constituting Tradition"
 GXC_constituting_tradition_desc: "In order to best exploit a breakthrough in enemy tactical zones and cause havoc in the rear lines, we must create an effective cavalry corps that can more speedily across rough terrain. Cavalry is the core of our second echelon forces, combining firepower with mobility to overrun our enemies before they can regroup. They will target communications hubs and supply depots, severing their ability to fight."

 GXC_battle_in_depth: "Battle in Depth"
 GXC_battle_in_depth_desc: "Battle in Depth is the latest development in Russian military theory, the evolution of centuries of warfare. Integrating multiple front-sized operations across several levels of operations, we can take on even the most advanced armies in China. Keeping up with military doctrines and technology, especially regarding manoeuvre, is vital in a landscape where many foreign powers have already spent years training and equipping our rivals."

 GXC_proof_of_the_party_army_desc: "The Whampoa myth began at the Battle of Mianhu. Outnumbered 20 to 3, two regiments of Whampoa graduates suffered nearly 70% casualties but prevailed over Chen Jiongming's forces, carrying the day with their utter commitment to the Kuomintang cause. If we are to prevail against the millions of enemy troops arrayed against us, we must recapture a similar spirit, carrying our banner high from Guangzhou to Beijing!"

 GXC_modern_revolutionary_soldier_desc: "Standing above all of their peers in China, the National Revolutionary Army was famed for their comparatively modern arms and equipment. Towering above the warlords, we should strive to emulate such superiority in the common soldier. No longer shall the Chinese soldier be seen as a backwards bandit, but as a contemporary of both West and East."

 GXC_modern_arms_in_the_middle_kingdom_desc: "The successes of our prior engagements show the absolute priority needed in maintaining our edge in the global arms race, for if any foreign power were to step into the Chinese theatre, we must be able to fight back with intense force. To this end, additional funds must be allocated to our budding domestic arms industry, for Chinese arms should be renowned around the world."

 GXC_suzhan_sujue: "Suzhan, Sujue"
 GXC_suzhan_sujue_desc: "A new dawn of warfare is upon us. Since the first light of tanks in the Weltkrieg, modern warfare has shifted to the superiority of a nation's capacity to produce and utilise swift mechanised and mobile divisions to pierce through enemy lines, and rapidly overrun their forces. Developing our own armoured forces, we must prioritise Suzhan, Sujue. Decisive attacks that inevitably force a quick conclusion."

It is of the greatest priority that our generals be trained in the most premier utilisation of artillery, and that new pieces be supplied to our whole army, for we can ill afford a stalemate caused by enemy defences."

 GXC_power_of_tenacity: "Power of Tenacity"
 GXC_power_of_tenacity_desc: "Tenacity, revolutionary fervour, absolute devotion. These are all hallmarks of the finest of Whampoa. We should reward such virtues by taking the best of the best and incorporating them into dedicated special forces, focused on succeeding where the average soldier cannot. For the valour and praise won in such operations will surely raise the rest of the army with them."

 GXC_amassing_dedicated_artillery: "Amassing Dedicated Artillery"
 GXC_amassing_dedicated_artillery_desc: "Lacking in industry, and with limited capacity to expand operations, the inherent desire for an artillery force comparative to the finest armies in the world has led our nation to direct all efforts towards maintaining a stockpile of the finest modern pieces capable of obliterating enemy divisions. The Chinese army will be feared, for with every footsoldier's advance, a shower of shells shall precede them."

Everyone dies. Yet does it mean that their lives, the lives of their comrades, were they meaningless? The memory of the fallen serves as a permanent example as to the dedication of the Chinese soldier. No matter the cost, they will defend what they prize most dear, the nation, their loved ones, all of it."

Dedicated in grit, soul, heart and mind, when the nation's freedom and very salvation is at stake nobody can doubt that the Chinese soldier will fight to the death to save it. The future is bright, not just for the next generations of Whampoa, but for the future of China."

Its ensuing efforts to catch up continually fell short. But we can ill afford to sit and bemoan the past.

 GXC_secure_foreign_benefactors: "Secure Foreign Benefactors"
 GXC_secure_foreign_benefactors_desc: "For better or for worse, China's continued division and underdeveloped industrial potential means there is little large-scale weapons research and development.

 GXC_combine_the_aviation_programs_desc: "The warlord era may have sapped the nation of its treasure and unity, but it has not robbed it of its imagination. Men continued to look to the skies, and daring military officers soon followed. Even poor warlords raced with the central government to develop aerial capabilities, though like many Chinese projects they have been plagued by ineptitude, poor funding, and corruption. But if we were to unite Liangguang's efforts, it is not too late to win the skies!"

 GXC_recall_the_pilot_trainers_desc: "The world's fascination with the soaring feats of post war aviators has inspired many young Chinese men to seek our opportunities to learn how to fly. Likewise, various governments and even some private pilots have sought to court Chinese warlords, leveraging their (relatively rare) aviation experience as a powerful bargaining chip. If we are to build an air fleet, we must seek out this expertise where we can find it."

 GXC_centralise_air_doctrine_desc: "Whilst our airforce may be blooming ever so wonderfully, in combined efforts, many observers have brought critiques of the disarray in doctrine practised by individual units, another ghost from the previous Chinese airforce attempts. Ultimately to exorcise such a spectre, we must work to centralise our air doctrine behind a coherent one, understood by all."

 GXC_expand_guangdong_naval_academy_desc: "Guangdong, long a centre of global maritime trade, has similarly benefited from a large, experienced seafaring community. Protecting this trade similarly has pushed Guangdong to develop a naval tradition of its own, culminating in the formation of Guangdong Naval Academy. While the primarily land-based needs of the warlord era has caused significant neglect, it is not too late for us to reverse course and expand seats at the academy."

 GXC_purchase_light_patrol_craft: "Purchase Light Patrol Craft"
 GXC_purchase_light_patrol_craft_desc: "The Guangdong provincial government's traditional focus has been on light craft capable of patrolling the Pearl River. Torpedo boats, minesweepers, and gunboats, humble by global standards, are nevertheless the bedrock of our fleet.

 GXC_ingenuity_at_our_fingertips_desc: "For the past decades, naval doctrines have never been the priority for any Chinese government, be it the Zhili, or Fengtian, the main theatre of warfare in China has always been the land. Due to this, our adversaries and contemporary countries alike host modern curriculums studying the cutting edge of naval warfare. A new curriculum inspired by modern developments must be taught to our admirals."

As the enemy marches across our beloved great country, his supplies lines grow increasingly thin and he will grow emboldened as we seem to fall back towards the interior. In times of crisis, all must be expected to give up whatever they may have in order to achieve the final victory.

 GXC_land_rent_caps_desc: "Many farmers do not own the land they endlessly till throughout the year. The most common form of tenancy is fixed payment in kind, then share cropping, and cash rental the least common. Share cropping arrangements often require a 50/50 split, and renters are often charged 10-20% of land value. Payment is often expected even during blights. Regulations capping rent at 37.5% and requiring six months notice before eviction will protect our farmers from extortion."

Provincial Warlords have spent considerable amounts of their budget on merely maintaining or growing their militaries.

The once grand Federalist coalition of the early 1920s constituted multiple provinces, and had the intellectuals of China in its grasp. Yet it fell apart in the mid 1920s, and plummeted even further after the Zhili proved Unification by Subjugation to be the true way forward.

Left with no options but to surrender our beloved nation to the depravity of the socialists or to stand and fight against their malice, we have chosen to make a stand against our former \"comrades.\" We fight and die in the name of the White Sun, Blue Sky, and Wholly Red Earth!"

As the socialist administration devolved into anarchy at the Third Congress, many slipped under the cover of night to our lines. It is imperative that we quickly constitute them into working battalions to fight back against the socialist advance!"

From Marshals down to Privates, no one seems to understand what is going on. An exodus of right-leaning and moderate officers thanks to hasty internal purges by the Political Department has given us an advantage. Though outnumbered, we can shatter their shambling offensive with well placed sources and traps."

The Central Army may boast of their shiny new weapons, but they cannot compare with our skill!"

Through considerations of awaiting the best opportunity, or playing to the strengths of its regionalist stature, instead of marching from Canton to Beijing, the opposite has happened. Soliciting submission in exchange for autonomy, the South has been brought under the North, for now."

Innumerable wealth flows throughout the city, travelling all the way to the Northern Capital with goods from Europe and elsewhere.

It is the Five Races Under One Union that promulgated a new era of Chinese prosperity, and neither the Well-Field, White Sun, or Rising Sun can dim its bright future.

Whilst ostensibly the Cao Kun Constitution and its 1928 amendment saw a Federal constitution, in practice the nation is hardly governed by that paper at all.

The past few decades of republican failure and warlordism have contributed to the sorry state of our national economy even if we do have the potential for a large industrial base.

And it is the moral dignity of every good official to pry themselves out from the mindset of a warlord, or a merchant, and realise that only by legality and constitutional rule can orderly implementation of national policy be swift and efficient.

But there is one ambitious, and at least somewhat pliable, local intellectual who has a sizable provincial following. Zhu Jiahua, an ever dashing and refined educator known for his membership of the Pro-German Jingxing Society, has proposed to the Governor an action plan that would rejuvenate the administration, and see to it that Shen bring modernity, not stagnation."

But assuming the Governorship, there is at least the expectation that the Provincial Army doesn't incessantly loot and pillage on the job. It is time to shirk the Green Forest roots, and cut it down at that. Half the men can hardly read or write, how can they be expected to conduct their commands in an orderly fashion?"

Our lasting legacy is that of National Protection, and it is our duty to see it through."

With the right of level of enticement, the Guangdong and Guangxi armies could see to it the addition of fresh soldiers from other Cliques, as long as they can bear any animosity."

 GXC_thus_unto_tyrants_desc: "In the name of defending the Republican order, and overthrowing an autocratic dictator flagrantly abusing the constitution, various warlords banded together and rose up against Yuan Shikai in the War of National Protection. And once again, it would appear, or at least as our propagand suggests, that a similar tract of history has played out again. It is thus that the people of Guangxi, Guangdong, and elsewhere rally against tyranny, and it is thus that we succeed."

Our enemies would see China torn asunder under political and military demagoguery, and it is imperative that our last stand not become one on the long list of failed revolts of the 20th century. We are heroes, we are victors, there is nothing that is insurmountable under the right amount of courage. Ready your swords! We must secure victory! At any sacrifice!"

Together, hand-in-hand, the nation's financiers pick up arms to do what the soldiers could not."

Hardly leaving their railroads, the armies of the North scant know how to fight without excessive use of artillery, or the capacity to supply their installations. The men of Guangxi and Guangdong have fought in some of the most dire conditions known to the nation, and for every intrusion into our territory, we must collapse and encircle the enemy with haste."

 GXC_reorganising_the_dsp_desc: "Controlling his party through political patronage and his Guanxi network, Zhang has all but almost witnessed his own party split at its seams due to clashes of personality and direction. With this new reorganised party, it is necessary to compose a new image for the party; one akin to an awakening lion. Combining the classics and loving one's country, this is democratic socialism, the North Star of our party."

 GXC_the_groundwork_for_democracy: "The Groundwork for Democracy"
 GXC_the_groundwork_for_democracy_desc: "In order to practice democracy in China it is crucial that there be a cultural foundation for democratic change. By accepting the Western conception of democracy — and its emphasis on individualism, liberty, equality, progress, and reason — and cultivating extensive economic development, these efforts will unleash the very same forces that led to the European Industrial Revolution, and Democracy."

 GXC_constructing_a_national_democracy: "Constructing a National Democracy"
 GXC_constructing_a_national_democracy_desc: "The basic concept of democracy is that of the infallible nature of educated and good men to the corrupting influence of political power. Through a modified Western parliamentary system, and a modified form of state socialism, political parties are to cooperate with each other, but not destroy each other, or the system. Under such a system, the nation will be prioritised."

Through cooperation with the likes of Li Jishen, Liu Zhenhuan, Sun Baogang, and other non-Yue officers, the DSP shall work to thoroughly sideline the militarists. It can only be hoped that Zhang's action is swift enough to keep the Yue daggers at bay."

 GXC_reinvigorated_five_year_plan_desc: "As evidenced by the great rebounds in economic development within the International countries and other state directed economies, it is clear that Zhang Junmai's preference for centralised year-long developments plans is hardly missplaced. Through concerted effort, China shall regain control of its own markets, develop its production capabilities, and transform even the frontier into utopia."

 GXC_liberate_productive_forces: "Liberate Productive Forces"
 GXC_liberate_productive_forces_desc: "With a large portion of the population living in rural communities, the agricultural sector is just as crucial as that of the industry. Whilst the notion of \"land to the tiller\" is admirable, any sort of land reform must be related towards production. By fostering development with science, technology, and collective farming as opposed to landlord liquidation, we may yet bring democracy to the nation."

 GXC_disciplined_mass_movement_desc: "Revolutions rely intensely upon the admirable bolstering of steeled discipline within the mass movement. To avoid all pretenses of a party state, whilst maintaining the essence of democracy, it is imperative that the government incorporate the mass movement into its operation. In this same sense, the military too, must be brought to heel under the state, no matter the ideology."

A lawyer by training, and ultimately thrust into the position of revolutionary general, he has withstood untold troubles. From the trials with Dr. Sun, to the duels with Beiyang's schemers, he has finally fulfilled his desire to see a democratic China — a true father of the nation."

 GXC_financial_transparency_desc: "The Chinese people have practically had to come to terms with the role of the nefarious and mysterious gentry, or local magistrate, or warlord, or politician, having amassed some significant amount of wealth with seemingly no explanation as to how. A republic cannot function if its financial transactions are not evidently clear, lest corruption and bribery fester in the darkness."

But it is only through the communion of foreign capitalist, and native industrialist, that China can truly reach industrial heights."

Through the wars of unification and against Japan, China has had to come to terms with immense sacrifice, and the large population of veterans have comparitively been left in the dust. The nation would not have been built without them, and we must pay due recompense."

 GXC_pursuing_a_federal_democracy_desc: "It is the Federal ideal to bear witness towards the radical transformation of China from a centralised hierarchical body hinging upon the Capital to that of one with extensive autonomy and democratic practicies within its constituent provinces. With any other party, they would see such an ideal sundered under their own ideology. Only the PIP can stay true to Federal Democracy."

 GXC_entrenching_the_yue_clique_desc: "In terms of national political cliques within China, there are the obvious: Zhili, Fengtian, Anhui. And yet, with their eradication or otherwise induction within other political bodies, many believed the time of the brazen patronage network was over. However the present situation has proven it necessary to construct a \"Yue Clique\" — only loyalists may rule in government."

 GXC_ban_subversive_parties_desc: "The state of Federal Democracy cannot be entirely pinned on the work of the opposition or foreign imperialists, for in effect the former stay true to reformist politics, whilst the latter are too far away to infringe upon national democracy. It is in fact the ever present revolutionary and warlord, that seeks to surrender democracy to autocracy, and they must be dealt with harshly."

 GXC_yue_clique_democracy: "The Yue Clique's Democracy"
 GXC_yue_clique_democracy_desc: "Far from the perfect idealised system, the Yue Clique and the Public Interest Party have nonetheless brought forward stability and the securing of future national elections under their tenure.

 GXC_steadying_our_democracy_desc: "The nation's path to democracy has not been that of a particularly stable one, that much is evident. But it has not been swept away in the demonstrable tide of history just yet. It is the absolute priority of the President-Marshal to ensure that the Federalist project does not beget another Beiyang Republic, and only the Yue Clique can truly stabilise such a situation."

 GXC_crackdown_on_radicalism: "Crackdown On Radicalism"
 GXC_crackdown_on_radicalism_desc: "Revolutionaries sit poised around every corner, waiting for even the slightest sign of weakness. They would see to it that the mobilisation of the masses be pressed against the Federalist movement, much like it was in the disastrous 1920s. No matter how hard they try however, the movement has adapted from its mistakes. And the only response to terror is equal application of force."

 GXC_the_canton_compromise: "The Canton Compromise"
 GXC_the_canton_compromise_desc: "Whilst collaborating with the Democratic Socialist portion of the China Democratic League is perhaps an impossibility, that does not necessarily preclude cooperation with the organisation as a whole. There are those who have perhaps been dismissed by Zhang, or otherwise, that have proven receptive to overtures. This was a Southern-led movement, and it shall remain as such."

 GXC_peace_with_beiyang: "Peace with Beiyang"
 GXC_peace_with_beiyang_desc: "The folly of the Southwest has always been its tentative positioning against the Beiyang Republic as the most absolute failure of Chinese statesmanship in modern times, but that is all that it is, folly. In the Yue Clique's time of need, the Zhili stood there to proect them against the onslaught of revolutionaries, and it is only fair that the debt be repayed."

 GXC_relief_for_war_families_desc: "Having received plentiful war reparations from the beguiled foreign imperialists who have wrought so much damage to the nation and its consciousness, the nation has similarly received plentiful veterans and displaced families as a result of war and bloodshed. It is but the natural response that these reparations be utilised to relieve their suffering."

 GXC_intermixing_freedom_and_nationalism_desc: "Under the posturing of warlords and dictators, the nation has seen the consistent misuses and abuse of one's own nationalism to further nefarious ends.

 GXC_economic_self_sufficiency_desc: "All nations across the world have had to bear witness to the failure of laissez-faire economic policies, The German economic crash and its catastrophic consequences upon the world order have proven disastrous.

 GXC_national_revolution_driven_by_the_railway_desc: "As evident all around the world, every truly modern nation, every nation capable of asserting itself on the international stage contains one shared factor: expansive, roaring, railways. The absolute key to a successful political tutelage phase necessitates solving China's endemic national poverty, and through the expansion of the nation's railways, we might very well achieve just that."

 GXC_young_minds_for_a_new_age_desc: "In one of his most recent ambitious endeavours, Sun Fo has sought to create the Sun Yat-sen Institute for the Advancement of Culture and Education. Designed to spread Sun Yat-sen's teachings, the institute hopes to dissuade the misconception that the Three Principles are only for the Kuomintang. For the Guofu's teachings belong to all people, most importantly, the young."

 GXC_de_caste_ifying_the_party_desc: "Whilst brought together nominally through mutual desire for the party's revolutionary ideals and loyalty to Dr. Sun, after the latter's unfortunate death, the party frayed into a variety of castes, cliques and factions rife with infighting. One could not advance within the party without befriending the right officials. To remedy this, we absolutely must equalise party membership to ensure promotion by merit, not by connection."

In order to enforce democracy in China, the party must return from the \"right\" to the \"left\"."

 GXC_a_china_safe_for_liberalism_desc: "Arguing that the prevalence of Socialist thought within China is a severe epidemic, Sun Fo is a staunch believer in the primacy of his father's teachings to be the most applicable to the Chinese environment, for if Socialism attracts the revolutionary youth, they would stray from the Three People's Principles. Therefore we must maintain a broad centrist coalition to safeguard the revolution."

To this end, we must alter the psychology of the people to educate them that local self-government is not so difficult as they imagined, and only after that can we train leaders for local government."

 GXC_the_first_step_to_democracy_desc: "Truly the Kuomintang Revolution is that of a democratic one. Born from the fires of Xinhai, the first Northern Expedition was truly the first advances of democracy striking back at the autocrats controlling the people. Having struggled in exile in Moscow and Paris, in Guizhou, and even Fujian, after all we have endured we can finally take the first leap towards the hard fought democratic ideal of the Premier."

 GXC_political_consultative_conference_desc: "Moving towards true constitutional rule is no easy task, to achieve such a triumph we must establish a cross-party conference in order to outline clearly and efficiently the most effective transition from the dominance of the party-state towards an enlightened legislature listening to all strands of Chinese society. Fortunately, the Party maintains some of China's greatest legal minds and legislators to assist in this endeavour."

However unlike more radical factions within the Kuomintang, we are open minded to not pushing the needle too far in one direction."

No longer shall they be beholden to warlords, bandits or aristocrats. The Chinese individual's rights will be fully protected by the government, for the Kuomintang desires only the betterment of our people and the happiness of their lives. After all, all are equal under the law."

 GXC_the_five_yuan_government_desc: "The governmental structure as laid out by the doctrine of the Kuomintang follows a layout of five branches of government all responsible for separate functions within the management of the nation. To highlight the idea of reconciliation and the hope to move forward from prior conflict, the appointment of figures to various positions within government will all be from different factions, encompassing the true extent and ideas of the broad Kuomintang."

 GXC_valuing_the_pen_over_the_sword_desc: "Whilst the National Revolutionary Army serves as perhaps the physical force behind the National Revolution, the intense politicisation of the army has lead to numerous occasions where the government must kowtow to the military in order to ensure continuous function and success of the revolution. Serving as an example of this, the chaos derived from Li Zongren's power play has emphasised the need for an apolitical military force."

 GXC_constitutionalism_triumphs_regionalism_desc: "An unfortunate reminder of the pragmatism required to ensure the success of the National Revolution, many warlords were given amnesty or even integrated into the governmental structure by our predecessors. Now that stability has been secured by the incumbent government, and with the transition to constitutional rule underway, we must strike at the very hearts of these local autocrats, for there is no room for warlords in the new China."

Expanding from their mere hamlet in Xishan, the Western Hills Clique has finally asserted the primacy of the old guard in Party affairs. Anti-Syndicalist to a fault, and valuing constitutionalism to the utmost, they are a most peculiar path for the revolutionary party."

 GXC_reviving_the_pure_party_desc: "Those that attempted to reconcile socialism and the Three Principles, those that attempted to parley with the Chinese Syndicalist Party, they have but sullied Sun's original intent. Western Hills must reconstruct a \"pure\" party with a \"pure\" ideology, for all those that act against the interests of Tridemism on the Left or the Right, they are but enemies of the party. Enemies that must be dealt with."

 GXC_empowering_the_national_legislature_desc: "Whilst privy to the concepts and ideas brought forth by the Federalist movement, we are members of the Kuomintang first and foremost. No matter what personal connections we have, the concept of centralism is a required one in order to prevent another disaster such as the Warlord Era from arising ever again. Power must be centralised in the legislature for the whole nation."

 GXC_abolish_the_political_council_desc: "Whilst naturally as devout and loyal followers of the Guofu, Western Hills holds the ideology and actions of Dr. Sun in high regard, many of his less than... well thought out endeavours have continued to cripple and hamstring the party. The United Front, for example. Or far more pressing, the Political Council. A body above the Central Executive Committee, it has grown too unwieldy to remain within the new China."

 GXC_restoration_of_self_confidence_in_chinese_culture_desc: "Outlined in \"The Philosophical Foundations of Sun Wenism\", the philosophical foundation of the Principle of People's Livelihood is based upon China's traditional ethical and political philosophy. In fact, Tridemism arose out of China's traditional orthodox thought, that being Confucianism. In such an instance, one must be prideful of Chinese Culture, for it informs revolutionary movements even now."

 GXC_datong_of_benevolence_and_love_desc: "Datong - meaning \"The Great Harmony\" - is the true end-state that the whole Kuomintang works ever tirelessly for. Whilst individuals such as Hu Hanmin desired their own form of datong, true harmony can only be brought through the tenets of benevolence and love. For they are the cornerstones of Chinese culture, and the fundamental spirit of the Revolution. Without it, there is but no fundamental base for Datong."

Attempts to weaken and pervert the Kuomintang party have failed and truly revolutionary leaders are in control. Now that all of China is rightfully under our grasp, it is time to turn inward and rebuild the country as Dr. Sun would have wished."

Now, the late Dr. Sun's vision will be finally realised as his true heir ascends to his rightful place."

 GXC_enforce_mass_demobilisation: "Enforce Mass Demobilisation"
 GXC_enforce_mass_demobilisation_desc: "Militarism has become insatiable in its appetite, having subordinated to itself both its own citizens and the people of its conquered lands. However militarism is more than the mere desire for land and wealth. The pursuit of empty glory, the hatred of one race for another, the cultural arrogance associated with a \"superior culture\", all stimulated militaristic adventures. As one of the great evils of the world, it cannot stand in Hu's China."

 GXC_the_six_years_of_necessary_tutelage_desc: "It is not merely our mission, but our duty to teach the Chinese people—who were crushed under the imperialist heel for so long—the importance of Dr. Sun's Three Principles. This is not a time for despondency, but for joy, as in these six short years of Dangguo China will be electrified with Hu's bold initiatives in legislature, science, and art. Now that Dr. Sun's true heir has took the lead, one cannot help but feel pride for China's bright future."

 GXC_the_exceptional_legislator_desc: "A distinguished and excellent writer, theoretician and demagogue, Hu Hanmin's literary career is as hallmark as it is prolific. Dashing onto the scene with his striking pieces within \"Minpao\", Hu has long been the ghost writer and secretary of the late Guofu. An excellent architect of literary prose, Hu's legislation has never ceased to take a breath as the Chairman writes his way to fulfilling the National Revolution, one document at a time."

For the party as a whole might become a privileged class separate from the people. \"In this revolution of all people we absolutely cannot tolerate the existence of classes.

Besieged by both Western Hills and Reconstruction, it is perhaps prudent to compromise on the specifics lest the Party waltz into autocracy."

 GXC_enacting_pingminhua_desc: "If the party were to ever become divorced from the masses, it would in effect become \"counter-revolutionary\". To prevent this from occurring the party must consistently bring its attidues and work style into line with those of the common people. As dictated by Hu Hanmin, such a process has been referred to as \"Pingminhua\", or otherwise as \"Party Popularisation\". The Party must guide the masses, and the masses must guide the Party."

In stark contrast to the sea of corruption and tyranny which once choked our nation, Hu Hanmin has not only resisted the temptation of autocracy, but brought Dr. Sun's dream of a free and unified China to its completion. Truly the Young Disciple has lived up to the Old Master."

 GXC_promise_a_thorough_tutelage: "Promise a Thorough Tutelage"
 GXC_promise_a_thorough_tutelage_desc: "As prescribed by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the Tutelage phase should last no more than six years, and therefore we must make the most of the timetable by which we have been bequeathed by the Guofu. Regretfully, Dr. Sun might very well have lacked the inner discipline and consistency himself to allow the revolutionary movement, and the Tutelage Phase, to be effective. Under the auspices of Hu however, the Three Principles shall be applied thoroughly."

 GXC_scientific_progress: "Scientific Progress"
 GXC_scientific_progress_desc: "Hu Hanmin has long posited that venerating scientific advancement is essential for the success of China's revival and revolution. Rather than the socialists in the party that venerate a violent and needless class struggle, Hu Hanmin has seen that the true method for arriving at Datong is through the wonders of science. The more we advance, the closer we come to a China that produces an abundance for everyone's benefit."

 GXC_dream_of_a_revolutionary_future_desc: "During these years of tutelege, we now look ahead to the final mission of the Kuomintang: the pursuit of Datong, the \"Great Harmony.\" Hu Hanmin has long argued that self-sacrificing love, or \"po-ai,\" should be the foundation of man's endeavors, and it is this self-sacrificing charity that our party strives for now. The Kuomintang plays a unique role in determining the future of the National Revolution, and we must guide the masses towards such the utopian dream."

 GXC_a_true_revolutionary_in_chinas_darkest_hour_desc: "If the Party wants to attain the goal of the national revolution, and become the party of the masses, then it cannot rely solely on a spirit of self-imposed discipline on the part of its membership. It must possess a universal and coercive type of discipline, one only posessed by a revolutionary mass political party. Shying away from any cult of idolatry, Hu has seen it fit for the Party, not himself, to take the credit for China's Revolution."

 GXC_training_of_the_four_rights_desc: "One of the foundations of minquan is Dr. Sun's idea of the four basic rights: the people's rights of election, recall, referendum, and initiative. It is our duty as the party of the Chinese people to train, foster, and encourage these four basic rights among them, for the Tutelage phase can only be concluded upon a populace that has demonstrated the capacity for conscious self-governmental capacity."

Hu Hanmin and his civilian wing govern the nation, Chen Jitang and the New Guangdong Clique dominate the posts of the military. With Hu's ceaseless exhortation to the Party to follow the teachings of Sun Yat-sen and to act in a selfish and dedicated manner, perhaps it shall be more than a facade."

And it is no exaggeration to say that Hu Hanmin himself is the guardian of the legacy Sun had bequeathed to the Kuomintang.

If the fire of the Kuomintang is not to be put out by outside force, it very well could succumb to its own fury.

Of course, one cannot dispose of China's millenia old history, but one can advance and modernise it for the times. Synthesising Western sciences, culture, and advancements with Eastern traditions, China will be the hallmark of a new cultural rival in East Asia."

 GXC_a_young_face_for_an_ancient_civilisation: "A Young Face for an Ancient Civilisation"
 GXC_a_young_face_for_an_ancient_civilisation_desc: "In an ode to his adopted birthright, Lu Yuguang has reached the highest office of the nation at an age that is entirely outstanding of his contemporaries. Finishing what his father started, Lu has become a Marshal for a New Generation of Chinese."

 GXC_triumph_of_the_crisp_handshake: "Triumph of the Crisp Handshake"
 GXC_triumph_of_the_crisp_handshake_desc: "Securing victory over the militarists, the Guangdong and Guangxi Civilians of the Merchant Corps and Political Science have emerged to be the brokers of a new Beiyang Republic. Shirking the rifle for the pen and paper, all eyes are on the Merchants and Politicians to see who will overcome the other, instituting their own form of Western-inspired governance by the ballot."

 GXC_beiyang_of_the_south: "Beiyang of the South"
 GXC_beiyang_of_the_south_desc: "Whilst not a true son of the North, [ROOT.GetLeader]'s Army and its associated contemporaries have reigned in Liangguang and led the march of unification. Without a clear ideological outlook, at least in regards to [ROOT.GetLeader]'s acolytes, the nation looks upon the new Marshals and Ministers without fear or exclamation; ultimately, it is more of the same."

 GXC_maintaining_the_delicate_balance: "Maintaining the Delicate Balance"
 GXC_maintaining_the_delicate_balance_desc: "Governance is a delicate game, lean too hard on one side and the whole scale will topple. In order to prioritise all meritable governance, it is important to remain open-minded and pragmatic. Mass education, economic development, and a strong, centralised military are all points the majority of the Central Government agrees upon, and as such that shall be the policy of the day."

 GXC_employ_new_people_implement_new_policies: "Employ New People, Implement New Policies"
 GXC_employ_new_people_implement_new_policies_desc: "In order to rejuvenate the Chinese state, it is necessary to no longer excessively rely upon those of the old generations. For too long, statesmen have ruled in perpetuity, reaching ages close to their 70s and beyond. By refreshing every bureaucrat from the magistrate to the ministries, the nation itself will inevitably be ruled by a new age of fresh, modern politicians."

 GXC_the_teacher_president: "The Teacher-President"
 GXC_the_teacher_president_desc: "Zhu Jiahua has been nothing short of a rising star. Through political Machiavellianism, expert statesmanship or plain old politicking, he has managed to rise through the ranks of academia and government alike. With prolific contacts amongst groups such as the Jingxing Society, Zhu connects Ex-Presidents, educational innovaters, industrialists, and officers under his watchful eye."

 GXC_adopting_the_merits_of_jinbao: "Adopting the Merits of Jinbao"
 GXC_adopting_the_merits_of_jinbao_desc: "Perhaps the greatest statesman in China of the recent era has to be that of President Cao Kun. Having managed to corral the disparate Zhili factions under one banner, few could compare to his ever auspicious long-term vision for China. Whilst many would decry him to have been a sellout to German interests, only Cao and his Jinbao faction truly understood the price for progress."

 GXC_order_and_progress: "Order and Progress"
 GXC_order_and_progress_desc: "Order and Progress; such a notion shall be the very modus operandi by which the state shall operate. It is only under Order and Progress that the Chinese nation shall economically skyrocket. Guaranteeing safe economic investments, and a free utopia for enterprises, China will be an efficient, centralised, and strong state. Only then shall notions of political reform be viable."

 GXC_old_guangxis_canton_comprador: "Old Guangxi's Canton Comprador"
 GXC_old_guangxis_canton_comprador_desc: "Perhaps few would have expected that Li Yaohan, Zhao Army leader and independently-minded ally of Shen Hongying, would have become Marshal of the whole Nation. With ties to local Guangdong gentry, and having once been almost cast aside in the fires of the Northern Expedition, Li's tenure is an ode to the early days of the Beiyang Republic; an all encompassing marshal overseeing progress."

 GXC_cult_of_the_young_marshal: "Cult of the Young Marshal"
 GXC_cult_of_the_young_marshal_desc: "Lu Yuguang is the epitome of an enlightened ruler. Implementing the benefits and merits of revolution and reform without the trampling of tradition or the loss of national essence. He has neither sold the nation to compradors or betrayed his own ideals. Even further, the nation would not have been united without its Grand Marshal, and it is so that the Young Marshal is a national hero."

 GXC_studying_the_zhili_system: "Studying the Zhili System"
 GXC_studying_the_zhili_system_desc: "The Zhili, for all of their faults, carried with them the most recent bout of national stability and economic development within the nation since the Qing Dynasty's collapse. And as such, their system of statescraft and politicking must absolutely be studied, and improved upon; obviously avoiding the excesses of factionalism whilst ensuring the efficiencies of statesmanship."

 GXC_protector_of_tradition: "Protector of Tradition"
 GXC_protector_of_tradition_desc: "Akin to Wu Peifu, Lu Yuguang is the strongest example of the courteous Confucian statesman. Auspicious, placing primacy in intellectuals and scholars, whilst exercising dominant restraint in light of sweeping fervour, he and his adopted brother Ma Ji are tokens of stability, concrete pillars of the nation's politics for future generations, and signs of a modern Beiyang."

 GXC_primacy_of_the_military_arm: "Primacy of the Military Arm"
 GXC_primacy_of_the_military_arm_desc: "There is no greater service to the nation than that of servitude in the national military. To defend the state with honour, and to protect its citizens, those are the greatest responsibilities that could ever be bestowed upon China's brave soldiers. No longer shall the army be viewed with fear, or with disgust, instead only admiration shall remain. Hail to our national protectors!"

 GXC_victory_of_the_southerners: "Victory of the Southerners"
 GXC_victory_of_the_southerners_desc: "Ostensibly retaining its routes within the traditionally rebellious and progressive South of the nation, the Old Guangxi Clique has taken on a modern and refreshed outlook within national politics. Straddling the line between Reform, Revolution, and Warlords, the Young Guangxi faction of the clique has brought together various ex-revolutionaries to advance national progress."

 GXC_the_progressive_general: "The Progressive General"
 GXC_the_progressive_general_desc: "Under Marshal Lu Yuguang, and his close allies Ma Junwu, Ma Ji, Liu Zhilu, and Lin Hu, the Old Guangxi Clique has cast aside the eras of stagnancy under Beiyang, and brought forward revolutionary progress without the tyranny of Dangguo. Walking the middle path, the nation has been set onto the road of stability, and perhaps even democracy, at least in the future."

 GXC_bring_down_the_eternal_enemy: "Bringing Down the Eternal Enemy"
 GXC_bring_down_the_eternal_enemy_desc: "For too long, the Chinese community has had to endure fear and turmoil at the prospect of raids from bandit clans, marauding armies, and local misfits. And so it is crucial that the state finally exercise its full might, rejuvenated by recent nigh-total reunification, and finally excise the plight of banditry from China forevermore."

 GXC_looking_towards_the_whigs: "Looking Towards the Whigs"
 GXC_looking_towards_the_whigs_desc: "Under the Whigs, Britain experienced untold social and political progress, advancing freedoms and rights never before seen within the British isles. Ruled by a progressive and benevolent oligarchy, they emancipated the people, exhibited strength on the national stage, and championed the supremacy of the legislature. To liberalise China, it is crucial that we emulate their example."

 GXC_freedom_of_commerce: "Freedom of Commerce"
 GXC_freedom_of_commerce_desc: "Only through commerce and trade are the plights of national collapse, revolution, and civil war prevented. And China has long been in dire need of thoughtful, stable, and wise national economic management. And so it must be that the Merchants and the Middle-Class Liberals join together to further healthy economic development, and national stability, without demagoguery."

 GXC_raising_the_chinese_plutocracy: "Raising the Chinese Plutocracy"
 GXC_raising_the_chinese_plutocracy_desc: "Many would believe that the rise of the supremacy of China's businessmen and merchants to the avenues of the legislative and executive offices would be the mere substitution of the dictatorship of militarists for that of capital, but they would be fools. It is not dictatorship that the Merchants bring, but economic development, national progress, and Cantonese Liberalism."

 GXC_an_era_of_good_feelings: "An Era of Good Feelings"
 GXC_an_era_of_good_feelings_desc: "The time for civil war, bloodshed, and retribution is over. The only goal of government must be the sustenance of its people, the ensurance of their liberties, and a democratic future. The nation's purpose must be that of national reconstruction, and an end to partisanship within politics. Are we not all Chinese? United by common belonging to the nation; Five Races Under One Union?"

 GXC_the_democratic_ideal: "The Democratic Ideal"
 GXC_the_democratic_ideal_desc: "One cannot expect the masses to understand their civic rights all at once, when the majority can hardly sustain their households, or are ruled by their local elites. But you cannot rule a state through dictatorship, or divide it unnecessarily through Federalism. A democracy, if imperfect, but a democracy nonetheless. With abounding optimism, the parties must unite in harmony."

 GXC_frontlines_shift_in_liangguang_mission_timer_desc: "Liangguang has once again been thrown into a chaotic power struggle, but all sides are determined to avoid a repeat of the endless see-sawing that defined the \"High\" Warlord Era in the two provinces. This will mean determined moves to dominate the centres of power in Liangguang and assert long-term control over them. Failing to do so in a timely manner risks our forces simply melting away from exhaustion."

 GXC_introminigame_KMT_make_their_move_mission: "The Kuomintang Make Their Move"
 GXC_introminigame_KMT_make_their_move_mission_desc: "Despite their failure to organise a putsch in Guangzhou, the Kuomintang remain undeterred. With forces pouring across two borders into Liangguang and with various loyalist forces sprouting up amid the chaos, they have not been defeated yet. They will priortise taking their strongholds in Guangzhou, Shaoguan and Baise before moving into more hostile territory."
 GXC_introminigame_UPC_make_their_move_mission: "The Federalists Make Their Move"
 GXC_introminigame_UPC_make_their_move_mission_desc: "Despite Chen Lianbo's refusal to outright endorse Chen Jiongming's scheme to become governor, Federalist forces aligned with him continue to make their play for power in Liangguang. Rallying political idealists, frightened country gentrymen, and pragmatic warlords, the Yue Army will attempt to capture their strongholds in Guangzhou, Haikou, and Shaoguan before moving into Guangxi."
 GXC_introminigame_NPA_make_their_move_mission: "The Regionalists Make Their Move"
 GXC_introminigame_NPA_make_their_move_mission_desc: "Despite Chen Lianbo's inability to hold down Guangzhou during the first round of the conflict, regionalist forces continue to fight to maintain their control over Liangguang. A motley coalition of Zhili loyalists, reactionary and conservative politicians, Old Guangxi Warlords and reluctant merchants all loosely under Nanning's central command, this alliance will aim to shore up their positions in Nanning, Guilin, and Haikou before repositioning to more unruly territory."

 GXC_introminigame_secure_state_decision: "Move to Secure [FROM.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]"
 GXC_introminigame_secure_state_decision_desc: "Our victory in the initial stages of the fight for Guangzhou has given our side considerable momentum, but the war for Liangguang is far from over. If we are to win this conflict, we will need to secure all of Liangguang's centres of power, starting with [FROM.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. This requires more than simply deploying our soldiers, militia-men, but rather a comprehensive effort to win the local population and their leaders to our cause and bring Liangguang one step closer to a speedy unification."

 GXC_industrial_stabilisation_mission_timer_desc: "Our industrial sector is crumbling, factories and local companies are shutting down, unable to weather the storm of Black Monday. Even worse, unemployment skyrockets, and the workers are on the verge of rioting, but a light forever remains at the end of the tunnel.

 GXC_KMT_clash_for_canton_decision_category: "The Clash for Canton"
 GXC_KMT_clash_for_canton_decision_category_desc: "The death of Sun Chuanfang destabilised reactionary rule across the League of Eight Provinces, allowing an array of Kuomintang forces to topple the old regime in Liangguang, the traditional heartland of the party. A provisional Kuomintang junta has been established in Guangzhou (Canton), though it is only a matter of time before it unravels. §gGeneral Chen Jitang and his New Guangdong Clique§! control southern Guangdong while northern Guangdong has fallen MinGan §SGeneral Chen Mingshu and his 10th Division's§! sway.

A rightist with national ambitions of his own, he is suspicious of the designs of both Chens, and his ultimate loyalty may determine the ultimate fate of both provinces."
 GXC_clash_for_canton_CHI_is_puppet_key: "Having returned to China with the help of foreign support, the §RLeft Kuomintang§! is a twisted mockery of the original Nationalist Party: a foreign puppet for foreigners to impose yet another alien system into China. With most Liangguang republicans thoroughly disgusted at the Central Committee's shameless subjugation to foreign interests, including many in the centre-left, §RChen Mingshu's mission is all but doomed.§!"
 GXC_clash_for_canton_CHI_is_gov_key: "Having secured a resounding leftist success in the League War, the §RLeft Kuomintang§! has begun funnelling supplies to the 10th Division, now expanded to the §S\"New Fourth Army\"§!, to support Chen in securing Liangguang for the left. Should §S$GXC_new_fourth_army_party$§! popularity is above 30%, they will be able to attempt to execute a coup in Guangzhou, subjugating it in the name of [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].\n§SChen Mingshu's§! §Yinfluence is currently [?GXC.party_popularity@social_democrat|%S2] out of the 30.00% he needs to win.§!"

 GXC_clash_for_canton_CHI_is_dead_key: "The demise of the §RMinGan insurgency§! has robbed §SChen Mingshu§! of any meaningful chance of securing full control over Liangguang. Still, he and his men remain dogged, resisting §gChen Jitang's§! efforts to consolidate control over the province.

 GXC_execute_leftist_coup_decision: "Execute the Leftist Coup d'etat"
 GXC_execute_leftist_coup_decision_desc: "With Chen Jitang's power waning in Guangzhou and the red tide rising in the east, it is time we make our move and proclaim the true revolution to Canton. A coordinated, determined blow from all sides will bring the tyrannical reign of the \"Heavenly King of the South\" crashing down like the reactionaries before him and he will no longer pollute the Three Principles with his stench."

 GXC_spread_nationalist_message_desc: "Freedom has finally come to Guangzhou, now that Chen Jitang and the Guangdong Army have cast out all the reactionaries and traitors that once poisoned the land with their perversion. But the work does not stop here. To set the groundwork for the Kuomintang to return in full, it is not enough to change our flags and speak in slogans.

 GXC_undermine_chen_jitang: "Undermine Chen Jitang"
 GXC_undermine_chen_jitang_desc: "Chen Jitang fancies himself as a revolutionary King, ruling Guangdong like a fief and holding court in Guangzhou while the riches of the province flow into his pockets. But we shall show him who really rules Guangdong: who commands the hearts of the people, who toils side-by-side with them, who truly has their interest in mind. Leaflet by leaflet, strike by strike, protest by protest, speech by speech. And he will soon find that his power is not as strong as he thinks."

 GXC_sideline_chen_mingshu: "Sideline Chen Mingshu"
 GXC_sideline_chen_mingshu_desc: "Chen Mingshu is only allowed in Guangzhou as a formality, a third wheel in Liangguang's ruling junta. A concession given to appease the party's left. But he and his lackeys, for all their flowery pose, have done little but rabble-rouse and cause senseless destruction. The people care little for words, if they did then after Chen Mingshu's speeches and addresses surely he'd rule more than Guangdong's backwater. No, the people want action and the serious, decent men of Liangguang will give it to them."

 GXC_call_for_unity_with_nanjing_desc: "We are not alone in our fight against the warlords and imperialists. Just across the border, our brave comrades in MinGan have fought on and they need our help. With Liangguang secured, we must bring its resources to bear in the name of the national revolution, uniting and submitting ourselves to the cause of Sun Yat-sen's heirs. For too long, revolutionary heroes have stood divided - this time we must march together as one!"

 GXC_crack_down_on_subversives: "Crack Down on Leftist Subversives"
 GXC_crack_down_on_subversives_desc: "After a decade of failed insurgency and wanton destruction by the terrorists of MinGan and the deluded ramblings and bending to Paris's will of Wang Jingwei's cronies, the left wing of the party have done little but besmirch the good name of Dr. Sun's revolution. They have some nerve returning to Guangdong hoping to once again enslave its people for the ego of socialist madmen overseas. We must work to stop them, censoring their publications and arresting their agitators."

 GXC_raid_guangdong_army_positions: "Raid Guangdong Army Positions"
 GXC_raid_guangdong_army_positions_desc: "The Guangdong Army see themselves as an elite army in China, but they are not even the strongest in Guangdong! Their supply depots lay unprotected, their soldiers lazy and cowardly, and their officers corrupt and inept. Like all petty bullies who spend their days oppressing helpless peasants, it takes little to send them running. Having armed the people, it is time to show them what true defenders of the nation look like!"

 GXC_skirmish_with_fourth_army: "Skirmish with the Fourth Army"
 GXC_skirmish_with_fourth_army_desc: "Victory is a powerful magnet in Guangdong, and an army's conviction in their cause can be measured in tests of steel. The so-called \"New Fourth Army\" are but a pale imitation of the old. We in the Guangdong Army are the true successors of that proud revolutionary force, and we will prove with our superior discipline and courage. They claim to protect socialist ideals. We will show they cannot even protect themselves."

 GXC_destabilise_chen_jitangs_grip: "Destabilise Chen Jitang's Grip"
 GXC_destabilise_chen_jitangs_grip_desc: "Chen Jitang has crowned himself the head of the revolutionary junta thanks to his control of Guangzhou, but his position is hardly secure. Meanwhile, with all of Guangxi firmly behind Li Zongren, perhaps it is time for a change in Liangguang. While General Li is hardly a friend of socialism, he has little patience for jumped up regionalists either. Chen Jitang betrayed the revolution in its direst hour, refusing to follow the National Revolutionary Army into Guizhou. With some subtle prodding in southern Guangdong, some whispers and bribes behind closed doors, and some carefully timed words at junta meetings, we will ensure true patriots are all that remain."

 GXC_suppress_socialist_insurgents: "Suppress Socialist Insurgents"
 GXC_suppress_socialist_insurgents_desc: "While the majority of Liangguang's socialists reside in the east, there have been a few leftist outposts in Guangxi. But not for long. While the Chens fight over Guangdong, Guangxi has fallen firmly under the grip of Li Zongren. Chen Jitang is an unreliable ally at best, though he briefly assisted Li in the old days of the Yue-Gui wars. And sometimes, it is better the devil you know than the socialist discord-sowers that Chen Mingshu has inspired in his wake. It is time Li repays the favour, helping suppress leftist insurgents in Guangxi and putting pressure on leftist positions in Guangdong, keeping syndicalists out of Liangguang."

 GXC_CHI_order_chen_mingshu_forward_desc: "Thanks to the tenacity of our efforts and bravery of loyal cadre within Liangguang, the tyrannical rule of Chen Jitang teeters on the verge of collapse. The tide of socialism is inescapable in Guangdong, no matter how much the \"Heavenly King of the South\" tries to contain it. With one final blow, we shall bring down the Guangdong Army. Coordinated orders will be sent to General Chen Mingshu and other brave revolutionaries in Guangdong, returning the true revolution to the province!"

 GXC_CHI_rally_the_peasantry: "Rally the Guangdong Peasantry"
 GXC_CHI_rally_the_peasantry_desc: "The peasants of Guangdong chafe under the yoke of the gentry, forced to listen to Chen Jitang's false promises of \"cooperatives\" that only serve his own interests over the people. But they all know it is lies, and eagerly listen to the fiery words of Peng Pai and other leftist activists who proclaim the good news of the coming revolution. Through hidden meetings and growing acts of defiance, we will deny the fruits of the countryside to Chen Jitang's cabal, returning it to its rightful owners."

 GXC_CHI_mobilise_the_unions: "Mobilise Cantonese Unions"
 GXC_CHI_mobilise_the_unions_desc: "The Pearl River Delta, a region with a relatively developed industrial base and shipping industry, has a relatively mature proletarian class receptive to education in class consciousness. Though circumstances have not always been kind to unionisation in Guangzhou and Hong Kong, particularly after the repression in the years following the Canton-Hong Kong strike, there has never been a shortage of dauntless men willing to fight for their rights. Tan Pingshan has been deployed to liaison with the triumvirate of Guangzhou union leaders Deng Fa, Deng Zhongxia and Zhang Tailei."

 GXC_CHI_moderate_our_message: "Moderate Our Message"
 GXC_CHI_moderate_our_message_desc: "We were never alone in Guangzhou, not even at the height of our power. In classrooms, in the press, and even in bourgeois homes, fellow travellers can be found who share our dreams of a new republic for the nation. These \"liberals\" hold misguided admiration for the failing systems of old colonial powers like the United States, United Kingdom and France, the same ones that they made their money and education trading with. Still, just as these ideals eventually set the stage for revolution, we shall use their support to our advantage. Liang Hancao, Sun Fo's chief lieutenant in the south, has worked with the Reconstruction Review to publish a series of articles stressing the shared democratic roots of our movement with others, and perhaps it is time we embrace some of those words."

 GXC_CHI_reinforce_fourth_army: "Reinforce the Fourth Army"
 GXC_CHI_reinforce_fourth_army_desc: "In the end, there is no substitute in revolution for the point of the bayonet. Pamphlets, protests, strikes - words are ultimately empty without the will to enforce the ideals behind them. This is a lesson the party has tragically learned multiple times. Chen Mingshu is not the most orthodox member of the Kuomintang, and not fully trusted by the RCA or PAC establishment. But for better or for worse, he is our man and he needs our help. His \"New Fourth Army\" will require more detachments to prepare for his ultimate mission to secure Guangzhou. Although the National Revolutionary Army's resources are stretched thin, Guangdong is worth it."

 GXC_reaffirm_interprovincial_hegemony_desc: "Under Governor Lu Rongting, the twin provinces of Guangxi and Guangdong were briefly joined together under the rule of the Old Guangxi Clique, which did not last long, however, as Guangxi dominance over Liangguang disintegrated following the devastating Yue-Gui Wars. Although the twin provinces went through years of a tremendous power vacuum after the collapse of the Northern Expedition, Governor Lu Rongting returned to power in Guangxi and, through his pragmatic alliances, managed to secure himself the position of 'Viceroy of Liangguang'. As heirs to his legacy, with the dust having settled across the wartorn provinces, we shall reassert our dominance and remind those who oppose us who the true masters of Liangguang are."

 GXC_attract_foreign_support_desc: "Our control over the territories we rule is limited, to say the least. With us lacking allies within Liangguang, and those that we do have only doing so out of pragmatic self-preservation, we lack the means to overcome our precarious military and economic situation. Despite the rest of the country being either too busy dealing with their internal struggles, or outright hostile to our cause, we are fortunately still able to obtain foreign support through our contacts. By attracting their favour, our misfortunes shall be reversed, even if it comes at a price."

 GXC_harmony_with_the_business_class_desc: "For centuries, the merchant and business class have been the backbone to China's prosperity, accumulating wealth and building local economies through trade. Should our relations with them remain harmonious and cooperative, the prosperity and wealth brought on by these merchants would be of great use to us, assisting in our construction of Liangguang. Unlike the Kuomintang, which had needlessly antagonised and suppressed these merchant associations, we will continue to acknowledge their role within society and build a tranquil peace together."

 GXC_rebuilding_a_southern_political_establishment_desc: "Through endless warfare and administrative fragmentation due to political infighting on all sides, Liangguang fell into near-anarchy. Swept away by the Kuomintang's takeover of the twin provinces, the Beiyang-friendly political establishment in the South was in ruins. Even as our control over Liangguang returned in the aftermath of the Northern Expedition, the political landscape has never been the same as the local bureaucracy stumbles to regain its grip. With the help of local administrative experts, the construction of a more efficient and well-oiled political machine will assist in the process of political centralisation."

 GXC_treading_the_lawful_path_desc: "To rule lands through the iron grip and the army's strength is easy, but to maintain stability and social harmony is difficult if the rule of law is ignored, especially by the rulers who intend to govern their lands. Public perception of the governments in Liangguang has been at an all-time low, as crimes go unpunished and are, in many cases, encouraged as a path towards social mobility. With the calls for constitutionalism and democracy grow louder and louder, this is an opportune time for us to kill two birds with one stone by restoring public trust in our administration alongside calming democratic voices by demonstrating our commitment to a strict adherence to law."

 GXC_allure_of_money_and_flattery_desc: "The sorry state that Liangguang finds itself in is merely another opportunity for us to expand our influence in the South. Having recently repelled a devastating invasion by the Kuomintang alongside internal rebellions by bandits and local warlords, many within Liangguang are insecure about their positions, financially and militarily. By sending financial aid to assist in their reconstruction alongside flattering words of their leadership, they will become more receptive towards our government. After all, everyone has their price."

 GXC_bribing_the_disaffected_desc: "Liangguang may be in a semi-stable state on the surface, but to those who look within, it is clear that not everybody is satisfied with the current arrangements. Whether it be out of petty grudges, ideological disagreements with their superiors, or simply willing to do anything for the sake of personal enrichment, many within Liangguang are willing to switch sides if bribed enough. Discreetly, we can dismantle the organisational structure of an opposing faction easily, allowing our preferred candidate in Liangguang to gain control without much bloodshed."

 GXC_issue_threats_to_liangguang_desc: "With their military in tatters having recently come out of devastation, their inability to put up much of a resistance should another invasion march into Liangguang, and the need for time to rebuild their army has made Liangguang prone to appeasement. To further expand our influence within the region, we should pressure the leadership in Liangguang with threats, and hopefully, they will be scared enough to comply with our demands of accommodating our preferred side within their administration."

 GXC_accommodate_local_warlords_desc: "Aside from the incursions by Kuomintang forces, Liangguang was also plagued by rebellions staged by bandits and local warlords. Crushed by regional authorities along with the repelling of KMT forces, these warlords fled across the South, either retiring into obscurity or still hopelessly planning a comeback, intent on reclaiming the position they had lost in their rebellion. With them at our mercy, we could accommodate and use them to further expand our influence within the twin provinces."

 GXC_send_out_peace_feelers_desc: "The South has notoriously been the most rebellious region in the country, having been the host to Sun Yat-sen and the revolutionary Kuomintang, which had marched on the north in their Northern Expedition. Although the expedition collapsed and was unsuccessful, fears of a second Northern Expedition have yet to subside. Thus, it is necessary that we send peace feelers to Liangguang and ensure that conflict between our two administrations does not emerge, as well as strengthen those within their ranks who are sympathetic to our cause."

 ## Guangxi Army Decisions
 GXC_guangxi_army_category: "Expand the Guangxi System"
 GXC_guangxi_army_category_desc: "Conceptualised as a fundamental framework in which local Guangxi leaders are able to organise their Guangxi Reconstruction Movement, the Guangxi Militia system finds its historical precedence in the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties. Having no professional armies, no distinction existed between soldiers and peasants, with the army and people acting in unison. When the nation faced war, all in the nation took up arms. When peace returned, troops dispersed to till their lands. This system was referred to as \"Yu Ping Yu Nung\", or \"Army and Peasantry Are One\", as it appeared in the Li Chi (Book of Rights).\n\nWith this system believed to continue in the Han and Tang dynasties, it would ultimately be abolished in the Song, and so begun the animosity between peasant and soldiery. Even more recently, militia were utilised in a similar system during the Taiping Rebellion, and militias would consistently be raised during periods of anarchy within Guangxi.\n\nWith each county training and raising local men, militia units have been constructed within each village, school, office and university. Every aspect of the militia has found its equivalent respective twin within the army, and beyond military duties the militia sees service in communal and cooperative schemes, administrative censuses and land registrations. Emulating that of Switzerland, the Guangxi system is intended to be a model in which every Chinese citizen will find their purpose, or otherwise contribute towards the nation."

 GXC_add_militia_to_template_decision_desc: "Whilst the initial militia's formation has proved themselves successful in all facets required of them, the time has come to advance from a mere militia to a full volunteer army. Utilising long term enlistments, and a working draft system, every able bodied male of military age shall be trained in the way of warfare.

 #Subterfuge Phase Internal Event Chain (000-049):
 GXC.introgame.001.t: "Crumbling Hegemonies in China"
 GXC.introgame.001.d: "With the Lunar Year approaching, League Marshal Sun Chuanfang has summoned the governors of the League of Eight Provinces to Nanjing for their annual conference. Notably not in attendance is Governor Zhao Hengti of Hunan, Viceroy Lu Yuguang of Liangguang, or his adopted-brother Governor Ma Ji of Guangxi. Shen Hongying, the quasi-recognised Governor of Guangdong has attended, ostensibly in the Old Guangxi Clique's stead.\n\nThough the \"High Warlord Era\" in China ended with the Zhili reunification of China, politics in the fragmented nation remains a complicated mess of personal ties and power networks that evade any clear hierarchies. On the face of it, the Northern Zhili Government in Beijing is at the top of the pyramid, with Cao Kun and Wu Peifu de facto rulers of the nation.\n\nSun Chuanfang's League of Five Provinces (the basis of the Southern Zhili Clique) expanded to eight in 1929 as a means of challenging the Northern Zhili's attempts to centralise the nation and disarm the warlords. Sun leveraged his own influence over Hunan, Guangxi, and Guangdong and the declining Northern Zhili grip on the south following the 4th Zhili-Fengtian war to secure their formal entry into the League.\n\nThe 1932 Shanghai Uprising in turn forced the League to retreat into their core five provinces, giving way for Lu Rongting to assert control over Guangdong - shattering Sun Chuanfang installed Governor Shen Hongying's attempts to move southwards and securing the submission of the Legation-installed Mayor Chen Lianbo of Guangzhou. Hoping to check Sun Chuanfang's power, Cao Kun restored Lu Rongting's title of Viceroy of Liangguang shortly afterwards.\n\nLu Rongting died in 1934, naming his other adopted son Lu Yuguang as Viceroy. Two years later, all three hegemonies - the Zhili, the League, and Liangguang seem to be crumbling, breaking under the weight of mutual mistrust. For now, the regionalists in Liangguang simply seek to protect their own autonomy."

 GXC.introgame.002.t: "Warring Factions in Eastern Guangdong"
 GXC.introgame.002.d: "Eastern Guangdong has severely fragmented over the years, never quite healing from the conflicts of the 1920s. The furthest from the Young Guangxi Faction's centre of power in Nanning and bordering both the League and the MinGan insurgency, the Young Guangxi Faction's grip is weakest there, allowing for local factions to swell in size.\n\nTo the northeast is Shen Hongying and his Shen Army Faction, ruling from the city of Shaoguan. An ambitious Old Guangxi Clique warlord installed by Sun Chuanfang as Governor of Guangdong, he lost the power struggle for Liangguang with the Young Guangxi Faction of the Old Guangxi Clique in 1932 and was ejected from his traditional base in Guilin.\n\nShen now manages two loyalties. Forced to bend the knee to Lu Rongting's sons Lu Yuguang and Ma Ji, he retains considerable autonomy thanks to the patronage of Marshal Sun who uses him to retain influence over Liangguang during the Southern Zhili's power struggle with the North. Ma Ji, for his part, was a former lieutenant of Wu Peifu, successfully brokering an alliance with the North for his father to counteract the South. This proxy battle has prevented League forces from re-entering Guangdong, but the lack of cooperation has also allowed MinGan insurgents (who do not respect provincial borders) to infiltrate the area.\n\nTo the southeast are a string of Old Guangdong Clique (Yue Army) warlords, hostile to both Old Guangxi factions. Mayor Chen Lianbo recruited the exiled Chen Jiongming, former Governor of Guangdong, to raise an army to protect Guangzhou's autonomy, and Chen once again proved adept at gathering forces around his native Haifeng county. Chen has decided to remain mostly in Guangzhou as a Senator, leaving Ye Ju to manage this coalition of Yue warlords, including Yang Kunru of Huizhou and Hong Zhaolin in Chaomei. They are hardly alone however, with socialist peasants under Peng Pai and his Farmer's Association continuing to fight a brutal insurgency against the Yue-aligned gentry."
 GXC.introgame.002.a: "Lu Yuguang has arrived in Shaoguan to soothe tensions with Shen."
 GXC.introgame.002.b: "Chen Jiongming tours the southeast to rally Yue Army loyalists."
 GXC.introgame.002.c: "Peng Pai sends messengers to MinGan to coordinate operations."

 GXC.introgame.003.t: "Anti-Concessionist Violence in Canton"
 GXC.introgame.003.d: "The ZheGan railway project, meant to be the ultimate showpiece of Sino-German cooperation, has utterly backfired. The AOG moved to consolidate control over many smaller railroads with the help of corrupt Zhili officials, giving them de facto control over what was supposed to be an equal partnership and prompting massive anti-concessionist protests around the country. This has triggered a greater wave of dissent across the nation as the Chinese people's repressed discontentment over economic inequality, Zhili authoritarianism, and continued foreign imperialism exploded into the open.\n\nIn Guangzhou, this has manifested in attacks against the merchants, who are seen as compradors for foreign conglomerates. The merchant elite, who have ruled Guangzhou since the German withdrawal in 1928 have called on Mayor Chen Lianbo to deploy his so-called Merchant Corps to restore order in the city. This paramilitary, initially formed to protect merchant interests from roving warlords and revolutionaries in the city, were reformed and turned into Chen's enforcers.\n\nWhile effective in breaking up smaller strikes, the turmoil engulfing the city has not been seen since the 1925 Canton-Hong Kong Strike. The Kuomintang, Chinese Syndicalist Party, and various anarchist groups are said to be stoking unrest through their agents in urban unions, but the tremendous outpouring of fury against foreign concessions indicates much deeper-rooted anger than all of them combined could muster on their own.\n\nAnti-concessionist beliefs extend to the intellectual class as well. Progressives and other members of the centre-left, most notably the Chinese Renaissance Society and the Public Interest Party, have also denounced the AOG. Dissatisfied with the reactionary warlords and conservative merchant government, they have begun to call for peaceful but decisive reforms in the Chinese political system. Their influence provides a distinct tug on student groups, pulling against more radical voices."
 GXC.introgame.003.a: "The radicals' demands for armed revolution inflames the masses."
 GXC.introgame.003.b: "The reformers' calls for measured changes take root among the protesters."

 GXC.introgame.004.t: "Shifting Loyalties in Southern Liangguang"
 GXC.introgame.004.d: "Warlordism is a complex topic. The lines blur tremendously between formal military and governmental positions, social and economic hierarchies, and the spanning networks of personal connections of both the \"local\" warlords and the \"great\" warlords. Between them and the \"great\" warlords who rule entire provinces are another group of \"petty\" or \"minor\" warlords. In Southern Liangguang is a triangle of three of such men, each of whom have vacillated in their allegiances over the years.\n\nDeng Benyin is the ruler of Qiongya, having seized it from the Old Guangxi Clique in 1921 on behalf of the Guangzhou government. Implementing progressive reforms on the island and consolidating his rule, he sided with Chen Jiongming in 1922 before attempting a form of armed neutrality. His Zhili-backed Eight-County Allied Army was ultimately defeated by the Kuomintang in the late 1920s, but he was restored by German-Zhili troops in 1925.\n\nNorth of the Leizhou Peninsula is a region where lines of control are fuzzy. To the east is Liu Zhenhuan's Guangxi Army. An ambitious Guangxi warlord in the 1920s, he had ties to Lu Rongting and Shen Hongying but fell out with both and defected to the Guangzhou camp. Never quite fitting in with Chen Jiongming or Sun Yat-sen, his ambitions always seemed to have been to become Governor of Guangxi but his various plots (most notably allying with Yang Ximin's Yunnan Army to form the Dian-Gui Army) ultimately came to naught. An opium-addled gambler, he swore fealty to Chen Lianbo after 1927 but is trusted by no one.\n\nTo the west is Lin Hu, part of the quadrumvirate that rules the Young Guangxi Faction. Defeated by the Guangdong Army in 1922, he sided with Chen Jiongming against Sun Yat-sen but was ultimately defeated. When his sworn brother Ma Ji was installed as Governor of Guangxi by the Zhili a few years later, he returned from exile and set up camp in Yulin."
 GXC.introgame.004.a: "Amid uncertain gales, the petty warlords prize stability."
 GXC.introgame.004.b: "Amid the howling winds, the petty warlords can feel change is coming."

 GXC.introgame.005.t: "The Baise Borderlands"
 GXC.introgame.005.d: "Ever since the death of Liu Rifu in 1933, western Guangxi has grown less and less stable. Kuomintang raids from Guizhou into the area have escalated amid national unrest. The poor, mountainous area has proven to be a porous border for the mixed band of insurgents, bandits, and militiamen launching probing attacks.\n\nThey are likely merely the prelude of the assault to come. The so-called \"New Guangxi Clique\" is a triumvirate of three men - Li Zongren, Huang Shaohong, and Bai Chongxi. After Lu Rongting's Guangxi army was routed by Guangdong forces at the end of the Guangdong-Guangxi Wars, Guangdong leaders soon found themselves at odds and withdrew from Guangxi. This left a major power vacuum as Lu attempted to reclaim power. The New Guangxi Clique allied with Shen Hongying to end Lu's bid, and then defeated Shen in turn.\n\nThe trio aligned with the Kuomintang, though their commitment to the party’s ideology was shaky at the time. Nevertheless, they furnished the Northern Expedition with the mighty Seventh \"Steel\" Army, and both Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi proved to be adept military commanders and organisers.\n\nRetreating with the rest of the National Revolutionary Army into Guizhou as part of their \"Long March\", they have not been idle. While Li Zongren is the leader of the group and Huang Shaohong is their chief administrator, Bai Chongxi is a brilliant military theorist who has conceived of a \"militia system\" for Guangxi. He has been vocal about his theories, implementing the Three Principles in a militaristic, societal level manner and the Seventh Army has been reorganised and radicalised in exile.\n\nDangerously, even when General Liu was still alive many local village leaders, local garrison captains, and bandit leaders in western Guangxi have put up no resistance during New Guangxi incursions. Whether due to sympathy, fear, or a belief they will soon be gone, New Guangxi forces seem to make it deeper and deeper into Guangxi each time before meeting meaningful resistance."
 GXC.introgame.005.a: "A newer, younger garrison commander is needed in Baise."
 GXC.introgame.005.b: "New Guangxi Generals have been taking careful notes each time."

 GXC.introgame.006.t: "The Young Guangxi War Council"
 GXC.introgame.006.d: "The inner workings of the Young Guangxi Government is opaque. Guangxi is a poor, isolated province, especially compared to Guangdong. Many dismiss them as being merely the chiefs of Guangxi's bandit clans, but the truth is more complicated.\n\nThe Young Guangxi Clique is a quadrumvirate. Founded by Ma Ji, Lin Hu, and Liu Zhilu as the young guard of Lu Rongting's Old Guangxi Clique, after Lu's fall from power Ma Ji was able to leverage his good relationship with Wu Peifu and service under the Zhili during the Northern Expedition to successfully claim Guangxi in 1927.\n\nHe invited his adopted father Lu Rongting to return as a figurehead, and the YGF rallied the Guangxi clans to defeat Shen Hongying and assert hegemony over Liangguang. Prior to Lu's death in 1934, he had long groomed his adopted son (and child of his favourite concubine) Lu Yuguang as his heir. A fairly unsuccessful military commander and a decade younger than his peers, he is nevertheless the face of the government.\n\nThe YGF do tend to respect civilian governing structures on the whole. Lu Rongting set a precedent of sorts by cooperating with the Political Science Clique during the Constitutional Protection Junta era, and his heirs regularly convene the Guangxi Provincial Assembly. The Guangdong Provincial Assembly, based in Guangzhou, notably refuses to recognise Shen Hongying as Governor but did recognise Lu's suzerainty in the early 1930s.\n\nStill, in vital matters, only a select council deliberate. The violence in Wuhu seemed to be a turning point in the League, with Governor Chen Tiaoyuan of Anhui seceding from the League, which may trigger a war. Some fear this will shatter the three-way balance of power between the Northern Zhili, Southern Zhili, and the western provinces. Moving against either may expose the fragility of Liangguang's own balance of power, especially as political unrest extends even into the usually isolated, conservative Guangxi's military, political, and intellectual elite."
 GXC.introgame.006.a: "The council decides a show of strength will keep external problems away from Liangguang."
 GXC.introgame.006.b: "The council decides a cohesive message of anti-concessionism will win back defectors."
 GXC.introgame.006.c: "More councils and assemblies should be called to navigate this crisis."

 GXC.introgame.007.t: "Black Monday Devastates Canton"
 GXC.introgame.007.d: "The precise causes of Black Monday is being debated and will probably be an extremely contentious topic in history books, but what is indisputable is the devastation it has wrought on the global economy. With the American economy still sluggish, the collapse of yet another vital Chinese trade partner has caused the shares sold at the Shanghai Stock Exchange to plunge in value.\n\nGuangzhou (often referred to as Canton by Westerners) has been severely affected by the crisis. The so-called \"Canton System\" basically funneled all of China's exports through Guangzhou for a century, and while the bulk of international trade has since moved north to Jiangnan, the collapse of exports has nevertheless caused deleterious effects up and down the Pearl River.\n\nAlready dealing with simmering unrest, the collapse of the economy has knocked over a major pillar of stability in Guangzhou. Wealthy Cantonese merchants and business tycoons often use their lavish wealth to fund major charities and public projects in Guangzhou, and with them forced to cut back on their patronage, public unrest is multiplying. The workers, many already on strike in protest of concessionist policies, are now on the border of revolt as factories, dockyards and banks close. Students too, fearing for their economic future, see little point in returning to their classrooms after weeks on the streets protesting, further unsettling political stability in the city.\n\nMost concerning for Chen Lianbo's \"Merchant Government\" however, is the impact the plummeting budget will have on their military. The Canton Merchant Corps, even after expansion, was never truly enough to do more than police the city. Fearing a second Guangxi occupation after the German withdrawal in 1928, Chen rushed to hire a slate of mercenaries, ex-warlords, and ultimately even KMT defectors to form an army to defend Guangzhou and outlying areas from warlords and socialist insurgents. Without money, he will have little to keep them loyal."
 GXC.introgame.007.a: "The Merchants Corps will simply have to step up and defend the city."
 GXC.introgame.007.b: "The Merchants will need to cough up money for the common good."

 GXC.introgame.008.t: "The Smiling Tiger Falls"
 GXC.introgame.008.d: "Sometimes, despite controlling provinces and armies and commanding vast webs of political patronage and hoarded wealth, all it takes is a single gunshot to fell a powerful man. And sometimes, all it takes is a single man to fall for an entire system to collapse.\n\nSun Chuanfang was shot, feared to be dead or dying. And while of course the League was already teetering from instability, Sun being out of the picture has made a bad situation much, much worse.\n\nRumours have been flying of a potential coup in the League, with Chen Tiaoyuan still in active rebellion and Qi Xieyuan said to be scheming from within Nanjing. Sun Chuanfang's loyalists insist he is still alive and will soon recover enough to resume control over the situation, but he has yet to be publicly available. The league is clearly on the verge of collapse.\n\nThe warlords that depended on Southern Zhili patronage are in utter shambles. \"Governor\" Shen Hongying, who has long been estranged from the Guangdong Provincial Assembly and the city of Guangzhou, has seen the balance of power over the province thrown into a tailspin. Generals Li Yaohan, Yang Chisheng, and Yang Ruxuan, all effectively paid by Nanjing to remain loyal to Shen, have all been vocal about their grievances in Shaoguan.\n\nTo the southeast, Hong Zhaolin has decidedly begun to move away from the Zhili orbit back into Chen Jiongming's sphere. Based in Chaoshan, a linguistically distinct region of Guangdong dominated by Yue, Hakka, Haklau and Leizhou Min, he was a fairly loyal (if a Chaoshan regionalist and infamous for his opium drug ring) Chen subordinate who was generally amiable to Zhili entreaties, helping him regain control over Chaoshan after the Northern Expedition. He has sat relatively neutral between Shen and Chen afterwards, but his recent emissaries to Ye Ju indicate his desire to strengthen their alliance - a major diplomatic coup if finalised."
 GXC.introgame.008.a: "Shen Hongying reasserts his control during a conference in Shaoguan."
 GXC.introgame.008.b: "Ye Ju brokers an agreement with Hong Zhaolin on Chen Jiongming's behalf."

 GXC.introgame.009.t: "A War on Two Fronts"
 GXC.introgame.009.d: "Qi Xieyuan's seizure of power in Nanjing yesterday seemed to punctuate the collapse of the Zhili hegemony across China. With the two branches of the Southern Zhili Clique trading blows, the central government reeling from the crisis, and the MinGan insurgency rising up in a major rebellion, the post-1928 order has come to a fiery end.\n\nIn the east, General Chen Mingshu and his 10th Division have been deployed southwards on a vital mission: to secure the Kuomintang heartland in Guangdong for the revolution or at least to die protecting the insurgency's southern flank. With limited resources, it is unclear if they will be able to hold out long enough for reinforcements to arrive - if they ever do.\n\nThey are not alone however. About a week ago, a large raid in Baise culminated with Li Zongren leading his Seventh Army into Guangxi to march on Nanning. It is unknown if or to what extent the dual invasions were coordinated, or if they simply had similar ideas the moment Sun was shot. Either way, what is clear is that there will be no retreat.\n\nNeither force can amount to more than 10,000 men. But victory is a strong magnet and Warlord Era armies have been known to rapidly expand and contract depending on who is winning and who is best able to pay. At the start of the Northern Expedition for example, the National Revolutionary Army numbered around 100,000 men organised into \"Armies\" of about 10,000 men each. At its height, the NRA reached about 300,000 men thanks to defectors and awakened sleepers cells, but fewer than 50,000 of them made it to Guizhou at the end of the Long March. Perhaps 20,000 more made up the core of the future MinGan insurgency.\n\nBoth are banking on sustained momentum to allow their forces to snowball. For their enemies, where to deploy the mobile, Western-style 1st Division that Lu Rongting prized will be essential to victory. After an underwhelming performance as their commander in the 1920s, Lu Yuguang once again orders them into battle."
 GXC.introgame.009.a: "Guangdong is less stable, wealthier, and needs reinforcements."
 GXC.introgame.009.b: "To lose Guangxi is to lose the heart of the Old Guangxi Clique."

 GXC.introgame.010.t: "Turning Point in Guangzhou"
 GXC.introgame.010.d: "Whatever sense of law and order in Guangzhou has bottomed out. With news of Chen Mingshu and Li Zongren's advances quickly making rounds across the two provinces, radical sleeper cells have awakened. KMT and CSP-backed strikers have paralysed the city in an eruption of rioting, joined by students and other protesters taking to the streets.\n\nAs the rabble begin to push back police forces, the Merchant Corps militia, and even military forces deployed against them, KMT sympathisers within the Guangdong Army have begun to plot against the government. At the centre of the conspiracy is Chen Jitang, a right-wing Cantonese regionalist who had defected to the winning side all those years ago and now must find common ground with the socialist agitators he betrayed.\n\nElsewhere in the city, Mayor Chen Lianbo was hoping to receive a show of support when he convened the Provincial Assembly but found himself walking into another headache. He was met by Senator Chen Jiongming, who demanded the floor immediately - brushing aside decorum and his political rival: Political Science Clique affiliated politician, former gubernatorial candidate, loose ally of Mayor Chen, and now Speaker of the Assembly Lin Zhengxuan.\n\nSenator Chen's \"proposal\", is to have him be elected once more as Governor by the assembly and using that power he will secure the province amid the chaos. He promises to respect the power of the assembly and a host of other democratic reforms in exchange for the Mayor's endorsement, but to Mayor Chen, the \"offer\" may as well be at gunpoint. Though the Senator has long retired from military affairs, it is well known that he commands the loyalty of a large segment of the Guangdong Army - who are certainly on the move anyway at this point.\n\nWith bullets flying in all directions, neutral and opportunistic officers are likely trying to figure out which side is the strongest. There is little time to waste for any side, though negotiations are expected to be dragged out."

 #Subterfuge Phase External Events (050-099):

 GXC.introgame.050.t: "Our Interests in Guangzhou"
 GXC.introgame.050.d: "The history of Guangzhou, also known as Canton, is as rich as China itself. Resting upon the mouth of the Pearl River, for a century it was the only port foreign traders could access. This caused the broader Guangdong region (also referred to as Canton) to become a major centre of trade, enriching it significantly. Although other ports have since been opened to exports (often by force), Guangzhou's valuable nature has not changed.\n\nIt has, however, been occupied by a carousel of successive governments. National Protection, Constitutional Protection, and Sun Yat-sen's Guangzhou governments were major southern challengers to the northern establishment, the latter two anchored in the city. This, unsurprisingly, has not been good for the trade of the region, bringing a great economic downturn for business and the people. However, after the Northern Expedition, Chen Lianbo - through great political manoeuvring and extensive negotiations between the imperial powers that would form the Legation Cities - took power within the city as Mayor.\n\nChen's power rests on his democratic control of the Canton Merchant Corps, the armed militia of the local merchants. His rule has not been without conflict, pinned down by the Zhili-backed Old Guangxi Clique and their notoriously undisciplined troops. Socialist unrest has also worsened in the region, as Kuomintang remnants threaten Guangdong's stability. Feeling ignored and abandoned by both the Zhili and the Germans, Mayor Chenhas been secretly courting the Fengtian government and also seeking the protection of the Legation Powers, most notably the Japanese from their bases in Formosa.\n\nMayor Chen, in his desperation, has sent an envoy to us. Requesting material aid and assistance in order to quell the \"flames of chaos plaguing Guangzhou\", he has offered only promises of future debts to be repaid. Naturally, granting him assistance would stabilise the Pearl River Delta, and grant us a token of power within the region, but it is not without risks. Chen's position is precarious, and is perhaps almost entirely self-inflicted. But with the circumstances present, it remains an open offer."
 GXC.introgame.050.a: "The Mayor will receive a secret shipment of supplies."
 GXC.introgame.050.b: "The Mayor will receive a staunchly worded letter of support."

 GXC.introgame.051.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Supports Chen Lianbo"
 GXC.introgame.051.d: "An envoy from [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has informed Mayor Chen Lianbo of [FROM.GetNameDef]'s wholehearted support in his endeavours in attempting to maintain control over the Guangdong region. Presently seen as the most stable and legitimate high provincial official in the region, Chen's growing renown has led to increased tensions amongst Beiyang partners in Liangguang, namely the Old Guangxi Clique. Considered Chen's main rivals, the Merchant has long voiced his discontent and unhappiness with Old Guangxi's self-assertive behaviour in dealing with unrest in the region, and their purported claim of de-jure rulership in Liangguang.\n\nWhilst tensions have remained short of active conflict, considering that their mutual enemies are far more dangerous, Old Guangxi has continued a certain obstinant streak against the Merchant Corps. Feeling abandoned by the Germans, and ignored by the Central Zhili Government, and similarly losing his grip on his allied warlord subordinates alongside increasing pressure from Kuomintang insurgents, Chen's turn to [FROM.GetNameDef] was all but a natural evolution of events.\n\nHowever it has raised even further fury from Old Guangxi and their acolytes, as it both entangles further foreign players into regional power politics, alongside cementing Lianbo's position in the region - with particularly dubious financial, diplomatic, and material support."
 GXC.introgame.051.a: "Foreign friends come in handy when it counts."
 GXC.introgame.051.b: "Old Guangxi raises significant diplomatic pressure."

 GXC.introgame.055.t: "Shen Hongying, Governor of Guangdong?"
 GXC.introgame.055.d: "The history of Guangzhou, also known as Canton, is as rich as China itself. Resting upon the mouth of the Pearl River, for a century it was the only port foreign traders could access. This resulted in the broader Guangdong Province becoming inundated with trade and commerce, enriching it significantly. Although other ports have been opened to exports (often by force), Guangzhou's inherently valuable nature has not changed.\n\nLacking any true allies in the region, the Zhili Clique has long had to settle on auxiliary forces and opportunistic elements. With many ambitious warlords in the region, the North and South Zhili have largely split their support onto different horses, functioning as another extension of their split. For the North, the most charitable group is that of Lu Yuguang, Liu Zhilu, Lin Hu, and Ma Ji's Young Guangxi faction. For the South, they were left with Shen Hongying.\n\nThe nominal governor of Guangdong, at least from Nanjing's perspective, has been unable to secure control of much of the region fully. With his rival Mayor Chen Lianbo controlling a sizeable portion of the Pearl River Delta and Guangzhou, Shen has largely fallen by the wayside. Swiftly amassing an army in the interwar, the Merchant Corps have blunted any attempts for a full Old Guangxi takeover. Similarly, the Guangdong Provincial Assembly has utterly refused to recognise Shen, and his rivals in the Old Guangxi Clique. To make a bad situation worse,Young Guangxi managed to oust him from his primary base in Guilin in 1932.\n\nOnly quasi-recognised, Shen has largely languished within Shaoguan. Directly sustained through the support network stretching from Nanjing, his forces are sustained by Berlin. However, his fief is overflowing with MinGan insurgents, and if he is to stake his claim on Guangdong, he would necessitate funding. Naturally, Shen's position would endear him to any benefactor in perpetuity, and he could perhaps be more loyal than the Young Marshal of the South."
 GXC.introgame.055.a: "Of course we'll aid the *rightful* Governor."

 GXC.introgame.056.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Supports Shen Hongying"
 GXC.introgame.056.d: "It would appear that Shen Hongying still retains a few tricks up his sleeve. Pulling on contacts outside of the region, namely his Zhili benefactors, Shen has managed to secure some additional material, financial, and military aid from [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] in exchange for some reaffirming of his allegiance to their interests and power. Pushed out of power by the Young Guangxi faction, circumstances have found the latter's independent streak pushing Shen forward as the Zhili's top-dog in the region, even in his isolated state.\n\nHolding a strong grudge against Young Guangxi for their ousting of Shen from Guilin, and similarly a rival with Chen Lianbo for Governorship of Guangdong, Shen has found himself in a difficult position. Relying exclusively on external support and aid, he had only tacitly recognised Lu Rongting's status as Viceroy in 1932, continuing to claim his position as Governor under him. With Rongting's death in 1934, however, Shen shifted his tone, utterly refusing to recognise Lu Yuguang as the new viceroy. Despite this, he presents himself as the lesser of two evils.\n\nWith Eastern Guangdong crawling with Kuomintang insurgents flowing in from the MinGan area, alongside Chen Jiongming and his Old Yue allies setting up their own power bloc in the south around Huizhou and Chaomei, the additional support from [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] would prove crucial in securing his position for the future."
 GXC.introgame.056.a: "Better the devil you know..."
 GXC.introgame.056.b: "Old Guangxi manages to interfere with the supply shipments."

 GXC.introgame.060.t: "Yunnan's Ambitions in Guangxi"
 GXC.introgame.060.d: "The history of Yunnan, Guangxi, and Guangdong during the Warlord Era has largely been interlinked. Key events, such as Long Jiguang's deposition of Chen Jiongming, or Chen's deposition of the Old Guangxi Clique from Guangdong, the Guangxi Age of Heroes, or even Tang Jiyao's invasion attempt in 1925 contributed largely to a shared political dynamic. Most evidently is the case of Gu Pinzhen's coup against Tang in the early 1920s, seeing the eventual expulsion of large amounts of his followers into Liangguang - known as the Yunnan Army in Guangdong.\n\nIn 1925, after Sun's death, Tang suddenly reclaimed the title Vice Generalissimo of the Guangzhou Government, insisting that he was Sun's successor, and made a power play by marching on Guangzhou. In order to reach the city however, he had to enter Guangxi. First offering a polite threat to the New Guangxi Clique, he would engage in conflict with them, being beaten back, and losing power briefly in a subsequent coup by Long Yun.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Northern Expedition, Tang steered the Yunnan Clique inwards, albeit maintaining an eye on Guangzhou politics. However, he is not a man to make the same mistake twice, and in influencing Guizhou, he has ironically allowed New Guangxi to do it for him. Raiding through their shared border, Li Zongren's 7th Army has long yearned to return to their home province, seen as a rival by Zhu Peide and He Yingqin. In retaliation, the Guangxi generals have requested that Tang Jiyao increase his patrols within Guizhou and prevent further raids. An option not nearly as tantalising as maintaining the status quo.\n\nFor Tang personally, the best option to seize Guangzhou is to contact an old ally, Liu Zhenhuan. Having worked together in the 1925 invasion attempt, Liu has long desired the Governorship of Guangxi. A half-hearted ally to Federalism and democracy, perhaps Liu could prove the right player to finally wrangle Guangxi under the Federalist cause."

 GXC.introgame.061.t: "Liu Zhenhuan's Schemes in Guangxi"
 GXC.introgame.061.d: "A noble and sincere revolutionary from a young age, Liu Zhenhuan has long been a regional power player within Liangguang. Aiding Lu Rongting, the National Protection Army, the Constitutional Protection Government, parleying with Sun Yat-sen, Chen Jiongming, Yang Ximin, Li Genyuan, and Tang Jiyao alike, he has long floated himself as an in-between, uniting revolutionaries of reform and revolution simultaneously. Elusively tied to the Political Science Clique in the North, he carries with himself a certain level of pompous middle-of-the-road liberalism, at least depending on the situation.\n\nSuffice to say, however, his reputation within Liangguang is far from perfect, with his soldiers committing numerous abuses a decade ago. In addition, his everlasting ambition for the Governorship of Guangxi has seen him ally with numerous contrasting allies in order to seize the position. First with Sun Yat-sen, and later Tang Jiyao alongside Chen Jiongming, Liu's scheme with Yang Ximin would be one of the last acts of regional resistance against the Kuomintang before the Northern Expedition. Following his defeat, Liu floated a half-hearted turn towards the Federalist cause and democratic activism, promoting the activities of the United National Construction League, and then the Federation of Chinese Democratic Parties.\n\nOnce again a local power player in the region, it would appear the ever ambitious Liu has reached out to Tang Jiyao yet again, and together have begun attempting to secure defectors amongst disaffected Guangxi Clique members. In particular, their presence has largely been felt amongst Lin Hu's garrison in Yulin - largely due to mutual Political Science ties, and association with Chen Jiongming. Albeit his influence has been disseminating across the province in general."

 GXC.introgame.062.d: "One of the greatest military tacticians and strategists to have ever descended upon China in the Warlord Era, Li Zongren, commonly bundled together with his close friend and right hand, Bai Chongxi, has proven himself worthy time and time again for the revolutionary cause. Originally a gym teacher, Li would be emboldened by the duty and meritorious service present in the Chinese military. Seeking to transform its image from bullies, or a lowly career for glorified bandits, he would be thrust under the eventual employ of Lu Rongting, Governor of Guangxi. Rising through the ranks, he would first step onto the regional stage upon Lu's deposition, and the Guangxi Age of Heroes. Allying with Bai Chongxi, and fellow Lu subordinate Huang Shaohong, the trio would form the New Guangxi Clique - aligned with the Kuomintang in Guangdong through Bai Chongxi's connections.\n\nHaving maintained a moderate stranglehold on the province up until, and during, the Northern Expedition, the 7th Steel Army still posed a significant threat to Old Guangxi's power within the province, despite their utter ousting into neighbouring Guizhou. Acting akin to their own rival within the Guizhou Kuomintang remnant, they have largely struck out on their own, raiding Baise frequently and experimenting with their citizen-soldier model.\n\nWhilst usually kept on a relatively restrained leash due to fears of Governor Tang Jiyao of Yunnan finally crushing their administration in Guizhou, it would appear that the faithful Governor has turned a blind eye to New Guangxi's gallivanting across the border. Combined with the Kuomintang acting seemingly in eagerness to be rid of their \"problem\", LiBai and the Two Huang's (Shaohong and Xuchu) have grown bolder in their attempts to seize Guangxi, redoubling efforts in the West. With disaffection towards the current Liangguang status quo further aiding their efforts, New Guangxi has even managed to gain some sympathy in the capital itself."

 GXC.introgame.065.t: "Our Southern Neighbours"
 GXC.introgame.065.d: "Governor Zhao is often defined by his friends to the North, however despite that he holds important ties to those in the twin Guangs, though his ties with Guangxi have faded with Lu Rongting's death. In Guangdong, however, there is an old ally of his in Chen Jiongming. During Chen's brief time in control of Guangdong as Governor, the two men worked together on the Federalist project, trying to negotiate unification with Wu Peifu. In the wake of the Northern Expedition, Governor Zhao decided not to join Chen's Grand Republican Alliance due to its underground nature, but has argued in its favour from within the Zhili many times.\n\nDespite having some old friends to the south, Hunan and its Governor haven't always gotten along with the twin Guangs. Due to Hunan's position between Guangzhou and Beijing, any north-south conflict would inevitably engulf Hunan in the flames of war, with the Northern Expedition having been the most recent example.\n\nHowever, the tide of history seems to be turning away from the Zhili, with Sun Chuanfang being incapacitated and the League embroiled in war, Hunan needs allies and friends. Chen Jiongming, who is using the chaos in the South to regain power, is exactly the friend Hunan may need. A man who believes in negotiation with the North, and a fellow Federalist just like Governor Zhao, Chen is our best option to prevent Hunan from being engulfed in war once more. That is, of course, assuming Zhao can convince the Assembly to allocate funds for such an extra-provincial affair.\n\nThere is another concern however, with small pockets of KMT control proliferating due to local support and their refusal to respect provincial borders. These pockets are being used to funnel troops and guns from MinGan and Guizhou into Liangguang. While not harming us directly, it may be best we use those funds to uproot the KMT in those regions instead of supporting Chen, given Governor Zhao's personal distaste for the KMT."

 GXC.introgame.066.t: "Hunan aids a Federalist Resurgence?"
 GXC.introgame.066.d: "In the early 1920s, Federalists Chen Jiongming and Zhao Hengti worked together as allies. However with Chen's expulsion from Guangdong and the Northern Expedition, the alliance has cooled notably, with Zhao refusing to outwardly endorse Chen's Grand Republican Alliance out of fear of Zhili reprisals.\n\nWith the cancellation of the 1933 elections however, Zhao found himself growing closer to his ideological allies in the South. Zhao Hengti and Chen Jiongming have maintained clandestine but increasingly open channels to one another, and as tensions rise in the south, Zhao has sent resources to Chen in order to help aid him in his attempts to secure Liangguang for the Federalist movement."
 GXC.introgame.066.a: "Chen sends a telegram to Zhao to thank him for his help."

 GXC.introgame.067.d: "The official Governor of Hunan, Zhao Hengti, has supported the Zhili and is personally aligned with the Federalist movement. Despite this, and the Kuomintang's loss in the Northern Expedition, insurgent cells and sympathetic figures keep control of a handful of counties in southern Hunan.\n\nIt is through these counties, especially with the help of the MinGan rebellion, that the KMT can smuggle weapons and men from Guizhou, Fujian and Jiangxi into the twin Guangs. Their hope is clear, that they wish to take control of the northernmost parts of the two Provinces, and use that as a staging ground to the south."
 GXC.introgame.067.a: "And through those trails, a northern base is established."
 GXC.introgame.067.b: "The supplies are stopped at the border and confiscated from their smugglers."

 GXC.introgame.070.t: "Chen Mingshu Requests Funds"
 GXC.introgame.070.d: "Guangdong has long been the cradle of the Kuomintang revolution and has thus acted as the capital for various revolutionary governments, many of which were headed by the venerated father of the nation, Sun Yat-sen himself. As such, the loss of such a symbolic city has dealt a heavy blow to our ambitions to liberate China, but this new wave of chaos in the South may be our second wind in the region.\n\nEven after the debacle of the North Expedition and the KMT split, Guangdong still acts as the hotbed of revolutionary fervour. KMT and CSP rural cells continue to sabotage warlord infrastructure and repel local authorities. Likewise, the various unions in the city and its ports have been infiltrated by syndicalist agitators. Outside of Guangzhou's urban centres, Peng Pai has rallied peasant groups to the revolutionary cause. Meanwhile in MinGan, General Chen Mingshu, commander of the NRA 10th Division, advocates intensely for the reclamation of his home province.\n\nA political maverick of sorts, Chen's allegiance lies primarily with the KMT Left, finding allies within the Provisional Action Committee headed by Deng Yanda and Song Qingling. However, Chen also holds ties with the India Clique and Li Jishen due to the strong fraternal bonds of the 4th Army, whose officers all hail from Guangdong.\n\nRecently though, Chen Mingshu has been more adamant about his demands to go south and reports have reached high command regarding his impending departure for Guangdong over the following days. For such an endeavour, members of Chen's staff along with Chen himself have requested funds from the Central Committee along with permission to requisition some firearms from the provincial stockpiles for his units. The recent onset of our campaign against reactionary elements to the North however has rendered our capacity to aid General Chen tenuous at best and outright impossible at worst, but the ball is certainly in our court and our choice to make alone."

 GXC.introgame.071.d: "Ever since the Shanghai Uprising of 1932 and the further retreat of the Kuomintang from China's urban centres into the foothills of Jiangxi and Fujian, the establishment generals of Liangguang, and China in general for that matter, have considered them a spent force. But almost a decade of guerrilla warfare and rural agitation has proven the warlords wrong. With the collapse of the League, Kuomintang remnants in Guangdong, the home province of the KMT revolution, have only grown bolder in their strikes.\n\nOver the past few days, Chen Mingshu, the main commander of the Kuomintang on the Guangdong-Fujian border, has been observed by the regional garrisons of Meizhou and Shaoguan to be preparing to mobilise his men for an assault towards Guangzhou. Naturally, this news has spread southward, diffusing into the quiet hills and bustling streets of Guangdong alike. This spells further trouble for the tenuous hegemony that has held the twin provinces, as KMT agents have rallied to the cause, clashing with local authorities and bracing for the KMT's arrival. In Guangzhou, Mayor Chen Lianbo has ordered more rigorous patrolling in the outskirts of the city and officers of Shen Hongying's army take stock of their arms, preparing to weather the oncoming storm."

 GXC.introgame.075.d: "Much derided by the majority of China's power holders, and once thought to be nothing more than exiles languishing in Paris and Moscow, alongside obstinate guerrillas waging a futile death war against the ever slowly tightening noose of the encirclement campaigns, at least in MinGan, the Kuomintang appear to have found their opportunity. Staking it all, in a daring now or never strategy, they have pushed their fledgling units to their limits, motivated by revolutionary ferocity and sheer tenacity for a better China. With raids conducted in Guangxi orchestrated by Li Zongren and his 7th Army, they have been in conjunction with raids from MinGan, chiefly led by Chen Mingshu with support from Tang Shengzhi in Hunan.\n\nDoubling their efforts within the regions of Liangguang that they control, the call to action has rung true throughout their soldiers and martyrs. With the banners fluttering, their guns on their shoulders, their sabres at their waist, the blood of the revolution is blazing like a wild tide. Receiving extensive support, they have made preparations for a final daring operation to secure the birthplace of the revolution. Future struggles cast to the wayside, the National Revolutionary Army are following the warpath of their predecessors a decade ago."

 GXC.introgame.076.t: "The Federalists Receive Reinforcements"
 GXC.introgame.076.d: "Once thought to have been a relic of the past cast aside in light of Zhili and Fengtian's victories, along with the rise of the domineering Kuomintang, the Federalist cause in Guangdong had remained an undercurrent, supported by passionate intellectuals and gentry. Maintaining at least nominally aligned forces in Eastern Guangdong, their only true allies were those scant few voices in urban centres, alongside Governors Tang Jiyao and Zhao Hengti. Yet these ties would make themselves useful at the most opportune occasion. The Yue Army has managed to rebuff all opposition, reinforcing its hold within the Twin Provinces.\n\nReceiving support from its erstwhile allies in neighbouring provinces, they have redoubled their efforts, and entrenched their control. With confidence abounding, morale high, and men supplied, it was evident to most that the Federalist cause was on the recovery, perhaps even the upturn.\n\nConsidering its options, it has become clear that the time to press the advantage against the opposition was now. Establishing a communiqué with allied forces outside of the region, Chen Jiongming, Ye Ju, Ma Yuhang and others have launched an offensive against the Kuomintang and Old Beiyang forces, aiming to press them out once and for all."

With confidence abounding, morale high, and men supplied, it was evident to most that the Old Cliques were on the recovery, perhaps even the upturn.\n\nConsidering their options, it has become clear that the time to press their advantage against the opposition was now. Establishing a communiqué with Zhili forces outside of the region, Lu Yuguang, Ma Ji, Shen Hongying, Chen Lianbo and all other nominal subordinates were granted the official approval for an offensive against the Kuomintang and Old Federalist forces, aiming to press them out once and for all."

 #Political Tree Events (100-149):
 GXC.introgame.100.t: "A Shared Future for the Two Guangs"
 GXC.introgame.100.d: "Liangguang today may be divided and resentful, but they share a considerable common history. The Viceroyalty of Liangguang, which literally translates to the Two Guangs (Guangdong means East Guang, Guangxi means West Guang), was first established in 1452 by the Jingtai Emperor of the Ming Dynasty. Both provinces toppled the Qing Viceroy in the 1911 Xinhai Revolution, but the following years saw different factions attempt to dominate the region.\n\nThe Old Guangxi Clique under Governor Lu Rongting of Guangxi, working with Political Science Clique aligned-Governor Cen Chunxuan of Guangdong, dominated the Constitutional Protection Government after driving out Beiyang-aligned Governor Long Jigugang and sidelining Sun Yat-sen. They attempted to negotiate with Beiyang in turn, but the poor behavior of their troops and fading political support gave an opening for Chen Jiongming and other Guangdong Army officers to raise an army in Fujian and drive out the junta, restoring Sun Yat-sen to power.\n\nThis led to the two Guangdong-Guangxi Wars, which Guangxi lost. The two Guangdong leaders then had a falling out, forcing them to retreat but in the power vacuum a Guangzhou aligned New Guangxi Clique junta emerged. After the Northern Expedition failed, Old Guangxi Warlords working with the Zhili dominated Liangguang but fought among themselves for power. In a particularly colourful incident in 1932, Lu Rongting ordered improvised bombers to attack Shen Hongying's forces in Guangdong. Meanwhile, the remaining Guangdong warlords and the Guangdong Provincial Assembly rallied around Mayor Chen Lianbo in Guangzhou.\n\nLu Rongting secured his hegemony over Liangguang in 1932, with Beijing, Nanning, and Guangzhou all recognising his position as Viceroy. With his death in 1934, his less competent sons have taken the reins. And now, Liangguang is divided and resentful, with many waiting for their chance to seize its future."

 GXC.introgame.150.d: "With Guangzhou in flames and news of the crisis quickly spreading up and down the river, Liangguang has been thrown once again into anarchy. Troops are being mobilised and militias raised as the three major coalitions - the Nationalists, the Federalists, and the Regionalists - gear up for battle. With the deep personal ties that connect the various figures in Liangguang, defections are expected but with the deep ideological divide between them, compromise is impossible.\n\nLiangguang is no stranger to political fragmentation but after the past few years of relative stability, there is no one who desires to return to a state of prolonged conflict. Therefore the fighting is expected to be fluid and chaotic. Momentum will be essential as local commanders will probably cast their lots with the winning side nearby, which will compound on a regional scale across the interconnected provinces."

 GXC.introgame.200.d: "Though divided by ideology and leadership, the people of Liangguang are united in their distaste for war on their soil. With a quick and commanding victory proving to be elusive on the battlefield, many have grown disenchanted with their leaders' slogans and exhortations in favor of practical realities on the ground. The hatred and bitterness from the fighting deters large-scale fraternisation between armed bands, the prospect of a negotiated surrender and possibly defection for better pay by soldiers who were neighbours not a few months ago has grown tempting.

The stability and conservative reformism they have long promised but failed to deliver has found newer, more popular champions in Chen Jiongming and his coalition, with the young and largely ineffective Lu Yugguang being compared unfavorably to the older statesman Chen Jiongming. Likewise, the regionalism and provincial autonomy promoted by the Old Guangxi Clique has proven inferior to the patriotic federalism, which has drawn a larger crowd especially as the Old Guangxi Clique experiences battlefield defeats. The war will still be a fight to the finish, but now it is in the hands of the traditionally Guangdong dominated Federalist and Kuomintang movements."
 GXC.introgame.210.d.UPC: "$GXC.introgame.210.d.base$ Though the war continues to rage, Chen Jiongming and his Federalist alliance have effectively fallen out of contention. Federalism as a viable ideology has fallen considerably in the Chinese public imagination after the Zhili successfully conquered most of the south by force. Chen's move to fight against Zhili and Old Guangxi Clique domination had improved his fortunes, however defeats on the battlefield has largely sapped enthusiasm for his movement and most of his momentum has since gone to his more dynamic, radical rivals in the Kuomintang.

 GXC.introgame.400.d: "In the aftermath of Black Monday, a collection of leading Liangguang scholars, economists, and bankers have presented their grim but honest report to [GXC.GetLeader], outlining the rapidly worsening economic situation in the two provinces. Heading the commission are leading educator and former diplomat Zhu Jiahua as well as bankers Zhang Gongquan and Chen Lianzhong, three of the largest names in Guangzhou politics.\n\nThe two provinces have hardly had time to recover from the fighting during the early warlord era, enjoying just four years of relative calm after Lu Rongting established his hegemony in 1932. Banditry and piracy was rampant, forcing local towns, gentrymen, and merchants to expand militias, draining local coffers and reducing commerce. With the cost of doing business rising and exports falling from the Great Depression, the economy was especially vulnerable to further downturns.\n\nBlack Monday has hit Guangdong's silk industry particularly hard, already struggling from the impact of the Great Depression on China. At the start of the decade, there were hundreds of silk firms employing over two million workers. Now, there are fewer than a hundred and all but half a dozen are on the verge of bankruptcy. The rapid decline in a traditional Chinese industry is seen by some as an indictment of the emotionless materialism of capitalism, and others as a symbol of Chinese backwardness.\n\nThe societal impact of Black Monday has also been severe. Average incomes in Guangdong (a comparatively wealthy province) have plunged to nearly a third of what it was in 1930 and are worsening. Families are said to be selling excess children and unemployed young men are joining bandit groups and \"bandit\" insurgencies. Anti-Concessionist, anti-capitalist, and anti-establishment sentiments have been on the rise, threatening further social chaos."

 GXC.earlygame.000.t: "The Issue of Military Consolidation"
 GXC.earlygame.000.d: "The outstanding victory of [ROOT.GetLeader] has snuffed out all dissent and potential rivals to our claim of regional leadership. With this great triumph, stability can finally be restored to Liangguang and the process of rebuilding can begin. Among other pressing matters in such a time is that of consolidating governmental power over our fledgling military. Whilst receiving nominal training from Berlin, the Germans never thought of Liangguang's army as anything more than a colonial Askari to protect their Legation assets, and a broader anti-insurgency auxiliary for the central army. It is most pressing that we settle our military direction decisively and forthcoming, with this in mind three options have presented themselves.\n\nThere is, of course, the natural option of continuing to structure our army upon German lines. Furthering the concept of an elite core of units that would complement a broader, larger but less high quality army. Replicating German successes in the Weltkrieg, this would maintain stability within our own army and allow our forces to focus on preparing for the future.\n\nAlternatively, and perhaps unconventionally, our army could mold itself in line with the hit-and-run tactics of the Guangxi clans, institutionalising strategies deployed and used against the endemic, hardy bandits of Guangxi. To this end, we would transform our provincial army in to that of a citizen-militia, blurring the lines between citizen and conscript.\n\nFinally, we try to emulate the decisive forces produced a decade beforehand by recommissioning the concepts taught in Whampoa Academy. Featuring a smaller, devout and elite army built along Russian lines with embers of Japanese Bushido and Socialist revolutionary influence, the elite training of Whampoa could prove to be the crucial deciding factor in the future of [ROOT.GetLeader]'s government."

 GXC.earlygame.010.t: "To Unite the Peasants and the Army"
 GXC.earlygame.010.d: "A renowned Guangxi native and premier expert on waging war, Bai Chongxi had developed and theorised a unique set of tactics and stratagems during his time exiled in Guizhou. Through repeated stints leading an assortment of raids across the provincial border from Guizhou to Guangxi, he was finally able to concretely construct a new way of fighting conflict. Theorising that previous Chinese dynasties such as the Xia, Shang and Zhou had no professional armies, there existed no distinction between soldiers or peasants. This left the people and army to come into a union of one being. When war descended upon the populace all in the nation would take up arms and when peace returned, the troops would disperse to til the land. A perfect system of a complete fusion between civilian and soldier, which is known as \"Yu ping yu nung\", translating to \"Unify Peasantry and Soldiery\" or even \"Army and Peasantry are One\" as it appeared in the Li Chi (Book of Rites). Bai himself believed this system transferred into the Han and Tang dynasties, with it finally being abolished in the Song. Viewing this as a great travesty, and the beginning of peasant hatred for the military.\n\nCalling on China to restore a system similar to this, Bai argued that the system exists in countries across the globe such as France, Britain, Japan and pivotally Switzerland. While the validity of these claims are in question given Bai (and indeed most observers) have never actually set foot within Europe nor Japan, he has struck a common chord by arguing that only by mobilising the entire Chinese people can China can be saved from external invasion. Although his presence may not necessarily be welcome in the halls of power, the legacy of Bai's ideas remains in his Guangxi homeland, where he believes its tradition as a decentralised, militarised society plagued by banditry is an ideal founding grounds to revive such a system."

 GXC.earlygame.011.t: "Clearing the Banditry"
 GXC.earlygame.011.d.1: "There's a common saying in Guangxi province: \"In Guangxi there is no place without mountains; there is no mountains without caves; there is no cave without bandits.\"\n\nBanditry has been a persistent and continuous plague within Guangxi. General Li Zongren has theorised four main reasons for such a consistent bandit presence. Firstly, Guangxi remains one of the most destitute provinces within China. Secondly, Guangxi is perhaps one of the most isolated and remote corners of China, with various villages remaining disconnected, compounded by lack of education. Thirdly, Guangxi's multicultural conflicts between the various feuding ethnicities within the province has cultivated a hardy and martial lifestyle. Lastly, methods employed by previous governments to suppress bandits and banditry were vastly proved ineffective. All of these cultivate a thriving environment for banditry and partisans.\n\nUnder a new plan enacted by the government, Guangxi was divided into twelve militia regions, of which the district magistrates were given discretionary control over the militias to deal with the bandits and other issues deemed necessary, decentralising crime reduction. However, the anti-banditry campaigns were brutal and gruelling, requiring forced marches by both militia and regular army forces to attack bandit strongholds.\n\nWhilst it took several years to successfully complete, we can finally claim victory. However the question of what to do with all of the ex-bandits is now more pressing than ever. Most within our government suggest providing clemency for the men, banning them from the army and allowing them to return to their families on the condition of good conduct. Others within our government suggest we could recruit the men, as they are already trained and capable fighters with arms to accompany them. Finally we could do away with all pretence of forgiveness, and execute the whole lot for their numerous crimes against the Chinese people."

The military side of the programme will include basic drilling, rifle training, light machine gun training alongside hand grenade training and battalion assault exercises. With this will also be a singular 3 hour night exercise for each week of the programme.\n\nOn the other hand non-military training will compose 12 months of the course, comprising of 120 hours each focused on agricultural science, law and economic reconstruction, 180 hours on political reconstruction, 100 hours on Sun Yat-sen's thought, 20 hours on the three self policies, 60 hours on general cultural reconstruction and 60 more hours on provincial regulations pertaining to primary schools, 60 hours on selected essays, 40 hours on teaching methods and additional short classes on diary keeping, holding discussions, giving awards and punishments, and various others subjects. Simultaneously, a preparatory course is offered for those who did not attend high school, in which 100 hours are dedicated to Chinese language, a separate 100 hours to history alongside geography, 80 hours to natural science and another 80 hours to maths, with 40 hours dedicated to citizenship.\n\nThe sheer scope and ambitions of the new programme has worried some within our Military High Command, with some key officers highlighting that the military portion is lacking emphasis, and that the non-military aspects are both expensive and make the programme more of a basic adult education rather than that for future soldiers."

 GXC.earlygame.020.t: "The Influence of the Eagle"
 GXC.earlygame.020.d: "Since the dawn of foreigners setting foot in China, they've always maintained a consistent presence whether they were wanted or not. Whilst most of the spotlight remains on the negative aspects of foreign influence such as the treaty ports and occupations, there have been spurts of agreeable cooperation and mutual development to counter this. Many Chinese were able to be educated in Western universities, and industrialisation was bolstered by foreign machinery alongside their expertise. However with the recent chaos in Liangguang and in the broader world, many within our government are reconsidering our position and priorities into the future.\n\nAfter the first Weltkrieg, and partially due to the budding interests in the battlegrounds of China, the Reich had sent a plethora of German advisors to the region. Most were veterans of the Weltkrieg and were stubborn in that way of waging warfare, struggling to even conceptualise the realities of Warlord Era warfare. In order to accommodate for this, some of the even older personnel sent to China took inspiration from their experiences fighting colonial wars before the Weltkrieg. With such a mindset, a plan was developed that would be enacted throughout the whole of China: the Southern and Northern Zhili would both develop and cultivate an elite - yet smaller - 80 division plan which was to be supplemented by local warlords providing the equivalent of German Colonial Schutztruppe.\n\nWith the Chinese order all but shattered as of recent, key figures within our military have decided to emulate the aforementioned German plan, but with Guangdong at its heart. A truly premier core supplemented by auxiliary forces independent of Nanjing and Beijing, designed to finally reunite the Chinese people under one government - our government."

 GXC.earlygame.021.t: "Our Prospective Advisors"
 GXC.earlygame.021.d: "When it comes to foreign advisors and expertise, there is no shortage of help-for-hire to be found. The German Eagle hardly alone in trying to court Cantonese influence - the Japanese, Americans, and even remnants of the British Empire are all willing to lend a hand to whatever party can pay the right price. Whilst all capable have proud military histories that include expeditions to China, each option has increasingly evident strengths and weaknesses both politically and militarily.\n\nGerman influence is ubiquitous around the globe, and in China their guns, industry and personnel proliferate the cities. Having been the backers of the hegemonic Zhili factions in China, the Eagle was the kingmaker of the 1920s. However, since the Berlin stock market crash their influence has been receding and some believe that her feathers are fraying.\n\nVying with the Germans for influence, the Japanese have skyrocketed from feuding clans to a powerful empire, the only Asian nation capable of rivalling the Western powers. This meteoric rise could not have been done without their loyal and martial soldiers. Once considered a sister people, the Japanese provide the most accessible option, with a fierce reputation having successfully bested Europeans (and the Qing) before. Having eclipsed us in power, they have proven to be harsh neighbours and one would be wise to be wary of them in the future.\n\nFinally, the Anglo-American camp, a power that once stretched across the world, has had a storied history both within and without China. Their avaricious quest for Chinese markets proved to be the vanguard of China's humiliation, and other colonisers soon followed them. Their reign finally came to the end with shattering of the British empire and the American's catastrophic economic downturn. Despite past animosity, American exiles and British mercenaries flood into Liangguang through Hong Kong, and present a cheap option practically free of permanent foreign influence."

To offset the gap however, we have begun to take a keen interest in the budding arms market, acquiring a multitude of contracts for foreign equipment. Individual arms dealers such as Hänschenklein Böcklin have made their presence known to us in Guangzhou, snapping up defence contract after defence contract. Whilst our ability to pay these sometimes ludicrous prices for equipment isn't easy, it could be the choice between winning or losing our future campaigns. Presently, there are a variety of arms plans available to us, including purchasing a small assortment of Anglo-American tankettes and armoured vehicles, buying German industrial production tools to aid our arsenals, or more practically we can acquire Japanese artillery and infantry equipment to supply our forces."

 GXC.earlygame.030.t: "A New Academy Opens"
 GXC.earlygame.030.d: "The Whampoa Military Academy has a keen and storied history. Following the descent of China into warlord polities and chaos, Sun Yat-sen made multiple attempts to launch a Northern Expedition from his staging grounds in Guangdong. However, the fledgling KMT government remained militarily incapable of surpassing even the local warlords let alone Beiyang. To resolve this, the founding of a local military academy aimed at producing classes of revolutionary - and most importantly, loyal - officers to serve in the army, conforming to Dr. Sun's ideas. Concentrating all of the revolutionary military talents into one academy, the first commandant of Whampoa was the prodigy Chiang Kai-shek, with various other key figures such as Liao Zhongkai, Hu Hanmin and Wang Jingwei also serving in crucial roles at the academy. The cadets produced by Whampoa were some of the most fierce, loyal and capable soldiers to have ever descended onto the Chinese battlefield, willing to sacrifice everything and themselves for the liberation of the nation.\n\nWith this in mind our military high command has developed plans to replicate the tenacity and successes of Whampoa, reviving the concept of a smaller, higher quality and devout army to strike deep into the heart of our foes. With a primary influence from Red Russian and French advisors combined with aspects of Japanese Bushido, and now inspiration from modern Russian doctrine, the new Whampoa will produce revolutionary soldiers unheard of within China, bowing to no corrupt influence and fighting for the sincere future of the nation."

Leading revolutionaries within our government are concerned with letting the Whampoa cadets' revolutionary fire consume them wholly creating an unbridled and uncontrollable army, with many suggesting we must restrain them so as to not stray from being easily controllable.

A key component of such a doctrine however are the mobile units required to efficiently exploit the breakthroughs in enemy lines cracked by our noble soldiers. Whilst even the Russians have to contend with a slow mechanisation of the military from their primarily horse cavalry reliance - not aided by the influence of more stubborn White Army veterans - China as a whole is in an even worse scenario, hardly even able to afford - let alone produce - motorized of any sort. Some within our high command suggest we utilise our incredibly limited resources to fund a small semi-motorised corps, to pave a way for modern warfare in China. Others propose that we take the pragmatic option and maintain the cavalry corps as is, leaving motorisation of the army to a later date."

There is a growing fear that the arsenals of our rivals can yield far better equipment in larger quantities, no doubt with the help of foreign support. Therefore some of our military high command have suggested acquiring foreign contracts of our own to fill the gap.\n\nGerman arms have proven the test of time with their repeated victories in warfare and recent adoption across much of China since the restoration. Their competitors are the Japanese, who can produce Asian made armaments designed for regional theatres of war perhaps better suited for Chinese conflicts. Meanwhile, Anglo-American equipment has the benefits of being in surplus and inexpensive to acquire. Of course, there's always the ever present risk that these foreign arm deals aren't guaranteed to last forever, and so it might be wiser to support our domestic industry instead."

Most yielded very little actual impact on Chinese battlegrounds, with outdated planes and questionable pilots diminishing any effects they would have in battle. Despite this, the recent integration and combination of the various provincial aviation programs into one entity provides the blank slate needed to truly birth an admirable air fleet. However the various current air cadets are inexperienced, arrogant, and undisciplined - often owing their positions to being the sons of wealthy overseas Chinese families in the USA. Whilst an incredibly daunting task, some have suggested replacing the current array of pilots in order to acquire a more professional and experienced cadre, whilst others would propose that we merely tighten our standards and drill the current daredevils into proper condition."

There has been precedent for such a move in Liangguang's recent history, with Guangxi warlords having recruited an assortment of British veterans supplied by the Far East Aviation Company in Hong Kong to train a fledgling air fleet. These British trainers were then partially replaced by Japanese military personnel after the Imperial collapse.\n\nMeanwhile, Guangdong warlords have prioritised purchasing American and British personnel and equipment for their attempts at an air force, though rising German influence has convinced some that it may be time for a change.\n\nHaving taken steps to consolidate power, [ROOT.GetLeader] feels confident enough to implement a most opportune reform: he has decisively concluded that the deal should only be conducted with a singular supplier, no middle men. He proudly argues that will save money and reduce corruption in the programme, while further bringing the air force under his control."

Recently, the South China Sea was contested between the Chinese on the mainland, the Japanese in Taiwan, the Americans in the Philippines, the British in Hong Kong, and now presently the Germans in formerly French Indochina. With all parties vying for total security and control, all have developed unique methods to contest the waters. Whilst we could never match any of the great powers in their attempts to control the sea, we can still attempt to secure contracts to produce a fleet utilising their methods of sea warfare. The Germans and their expert use of cruisers in their Asian fleet, the Japanese contesting the waters through Submarine warfare or the Anglo-American reliance on Battleships are all prospective options for our navy to adopt."

 GXC.earlygame.050.t: "The Liangguang Joint Military and Political Conference"
 GXC.earlygame.050.d: "Following recent appointments within our cabinet, leading military figure Bai Chongxi has been given the most prestigious opportunity to speak at the Liangguang Joint Military and Political Conference in order to set the stage for his revolutionary restructuring of the armies. Bai heralded his new theory on warfare by arguing for utter mass mobilisation of the Chinese people.\n\nChampioning \"Yu ping yu nung\" (Unify Peasantry and Soldiery), he claims to have modernised this traditional concept for the new age of modern warfare. In his words: \"To prepare ourselves for struggle does not mean only that we must train troops. We must train the masses. Not only must there be military training, there must be political, economic and cultural preparation. The reason for this is because war today is not fought by army against army. It is a war of citizens against citizens - total war. It is a war not only of weapons. It is a war pitting the total national strength of one nation against that of another.\"\n\nWhilst there are those that provide ample support for these new concepts - most notably the New Guangxi Clique - there has been considerable pushback. In particular, scrutiny was aimed at the belief that Bai would rather transform students into machines aimed at warfare and nothing more.\n\n Thoroughly rejecting these accusations, Bai argued that he was only enforcing \"good habits\", giving them a new direction and purpose, dropping bad habits like esoterica. He even went as far to argue that a soldier is the liveliest person of all. \"In what way have I turned into a machine\" he reportedly asked.\n\nFollowing on from this, many are fearing that Bai's ruthless pioneering of the new strategies of warfare will cause fracturing in our armed forces, during a dire time of great need for unity. Others however, argue that an uncompromising revolutionary mindset is needed to ensure the completion of Sun Yat-sen's dream."
 GXC.earlygame.050.a: "No compromising."
 GXC.earlygame.050.b: "Exercise restraint."

 GXC.earlygame.051.t: "Two Military Systems"
 GXC.earlygame.051.d: "Our leading military theorist, Bai Chongxi, has argued that all militaries operate under one of two basic systems: \"Zheng Bing\" and \"Mu Bing\".\n\nZheng Bing functions using short term military service as a requirement of citizenship. The basic quality of conscripts are better than volunteers, expenses are minimised, more soldiers could be trained. While he acknowledges that demobilised conscripts recalled to active service will be inferior to regulars, it is balanced out by the fact that as each class of conscripts returned to civilian life there be little societal disruption nor the creation of banditry.\n\nMu Bing on the other hand, is the maintenance of a volunteer army recruited through long term enlistments. Regulars tend to be brave and well-trained fighters, but many career soldiers enlist due to having nothing to eat, restlessly want to loot and roam, or are fugitives. Their continual upkeep, even in peacetime, is a constant drain on the economy.\n\nBai has developed a new draft system where in peacetime it is voluntary while during war it is a lottery. Every able bodied male of military age will draw a number, when villages receive the call for conscripts those with the lowest numbers called up in strict arithmetical order will be recruited unless they can afford the special exemption tax.\n\nEach conscript will be assigned a militia class designation. Those of age 18-30 are class A and fought on the front lines, while those of 30-45 were Class B and act as reserves or rear area support. Rear reservists receive 10 hours of basic training before transferring to the ready reserve to periodically receive further training. If mobilised away from home, all will be considered standing militia.\n\nDespite this further elaboration of his reasoning, many oppose Bai's concepts, arguing it would dilute our army's professionalism. Many civilian members think this is a step too far, dreading further militarisation of society."

 GXC.earlygame.052.t: "Cadres of the National Revolution"
 GXC.earlygame.052.d: "As our military restructures, a new set of Cadre Militia Academies have been erected throughout Guangxi. Cadets receive a two month curriculum, with graduates sent to district militia HQs for further training or promotion. Guangxi news outlets praise these academies for adhering to the concept of schools being closely related to society and education being closely related to life, \"awakening the people\" unlike the elitist and impractical traditional schools.\n\nBai Chongxi has discouraged merely increasing the number of cadet spots in existing military schools, arguing that this creates an excess of officers in peacetime that turn into \"high class vagrants\". Desiring a militarised yet peaceful society, he has focused on giving existing university students supplemental training.\n\nHis efforts to expand this policy to other provinces has met backlash. The Guangdong student body has fiercely protested, insisting on the freedom of students to choose their education. The New Guangxi clique, notorious for their anti-intellectualism, castigated these students and mocked them for frequently protesting the government's inaction against foreign imperialism but being unwilling to put their own lives on the line.\n\nDefending his ally, Li Zongren claims military training is actually for the students' benefit, helping them cultivate strength and overcome the stigma against military service instead of frivolous, romantic pursuits such as \"playing violins and flutes\". A former gym teacher, he has described traditional intellectuals as \"men of letters merely taking pride in being slender and pale to show how truly cultured they are - lacking the strength to catch a chicken\". He bemoans that even in peaceful countries the military is seen as an honourable trade, yet in China it is consistently seen as a disgrace."

Advancing the integration of the militia into Chinese society, each woman receives similar training to their male counterparts, with such egalitarian efforts being considered a prominent and permanent feature of the mobilisation programme.\n\nWhilst a nominal attempt at equality of the sexes, there are still numerous critiques brought up against the initiative. Men still receive a wider breadth of opportunities for employment and there are plentiful arbitrary rules about maintaining separation of men and women whilst in service. In a striking new step to try and further the programme, leadership within the party have suggested the concept of allowing women to also serve in various combat roles and duties alongside their militia work. Much discussion has been had over such a proposition, as the issue is multi-faceted, with some within the party applauding a noble step towards a truly egalitarian society, however others note that it may be a step too far, cautioning against such an expansion - with notably the progenitor of the concept, New Guangxi Clique, opposing such expansion, stating that the current implementation is worthy enough."

 GXC.earlygame.054.t: "The Three Principles and Self Reliance"
 GXC.earlygame.054.d: "The returned New Guangxi Clique has exhorted the participation of the common people in the defence of Guangxi and its reconstruction. Whilst intended to promote local self-governance, the Clique never intended for the militia they've cultivated to be independent like the warlord armies. To them, the militia is an extension of Dr. Sun's principles, operating under the \"the Three Principles of Self Reliance\": self-defence, self-sufficiency and self-government.\n\nThe organisation of our new militia system mirrors the army including parallel ranks. District magistrates also function as district militia commanders and have military ranks equivalent to brigade commanders, with sub-district magistrates commanding 1,500 men regiments. Mayors are also commanders of local militia battalions of several hundred men, with local village heads or urban ward heads also maintaining local militia companies of up to 100 men.\n\nEverything is supposed to advance by 10s: 10 households are a village, 10 villages are a township, and so on. Nevertheless after difficulty in implementation, redundant levels like sub districts are being phased out for efficiency. Training of the militia is being handled by the local governmental organs, with the militia being directed to participate in census taking, managing granaries, directing cooperative agricultural production societies, transplanting seedlings, irrigating farmland, maintaining roads, establishing school curricula and so forth.\n\nThis has reinforced the dual civil-military responsibilities of district officers, modelled after circuit intendants of the Qing period. Still, while in their civil roles they report to local administrations, in their military capacities they report directly to the provincial government, receiving orders from their army group headquarters. Outside observers watch in awe or horror in how quickly the New Guangxi clique has transformed their province."

 GXC.earlygame.055.t: "The Hero of the 4th Army"
 GXC.earlygame.055.d: "In the age of the National Revolution, perhaps no army has contributed more to China's liberation than the 4th Army. Yet even in this assortment of heroes, one man stands above the rest. Cai Tingkai bravely stayed behind in Fujian following the necessary retreat of the Central Committee to France, awaiting a chance to ignite the Fourth Revolution. This chance came in Shanghai in 1932. The reactionary warlords Sun Chuanfang had bled Eastern China dry, selling out his dignity for German support.\n\nWhen the Chinese masses had had enough and launched uprisings in multiple major cities, Cai and his friend Jiang Guangnai wasted no time in sneaking into Xiamen and reaching Shanghai by boat. While there, Cai quickly took charge and personally fought against the encroaching League forces on the outskirts of Shanghai, organising the rebels into a more organised fighting force. Although unofficial, Cai and his men would be referred to as the 19th Route Army by the Central Executive Committee.\n\nWhen League troops under Qi Xieyuan finally entered the city, Cai and his men fought day and night on the streets in staunch resistance. When Qi came to the frontlines personally to observe the progress of his men, a stray bullet fired by Cai grazed his right arm. Despite the resolve of Cai, Jiang, and the 19th Route Army, Qi and the Jiangsu Army was eventually able to retake Shanghai and crack down harshly, leading to a general retreat into the mountains of Zhejiang.\n\nMaking their way down south, Cai and his men were able to evade Lu Xiangting's Zhejiang Army and linked up with the remnant NRA forces in Fujian under Li Jishen's command, who had the 19th Route Army remnants absorbed into the 4th Army. While the Shanghai Uprising ended in failure, Cai Tingkai and the 19th Route Army are forever remembered for their brave stand against German Imperialism and Beiyang despotism."

Among its fallen was its infamous Headmaster, Chiang Kai-shek, and with him the old academy dissolved. While many of its alumni retreated to Guizhou, others attached themselves to bandits or other republicans or retired to live quiet lives.\n\nDuring his tenure as Headmaster, Chiang made several attempts to increase the importance and magnitude of such a role within the revolution. Spurring on a flurry of deep interpersonal relations with the various cadets and faculty, he transformed it into a major political post that wielded considerable influence on the direction of not just the army, but the revolution as a whole.\n\nHaving revived this pivotal institution, the question of who to head it has emerged. While efforts have been made to curtail the role's influence, the competition for the position has nevertheless been fierce."

Xu Chongzhi for his part has been appointed War Minister, and the party is reluctant to centralise military authority into one man to avoid another Chiang.\n\nThe final decision is sure to affect the future of Whampoa and the National Revolutionary Army's direction for the forthcoming wars, and so the final decision for Headmaster is..."

His rival is that of General Cai Tingkai, a renowned hero of the Iron Army, a close confederate of Chen Mingshu, and one of the NRA's most skilled officers. Although his crippling lack of experience in the field of teaching has been his main drawbacj.\n\nOther contenders have largely withdrawn, or have been excluded, such as Chen Mingshu, or men such as Dai Ji, or Jiang Guangnai.

 GXC.earlygame.071.t: "The Headmaster's Legacy"
 GXC.earlygame.071.d: "Chiang Kai-shek's reputation amongst the party is that of a troubled one, considered by some to be a failure with the right intentions, or an attempted dictator seeking to control the revolution, the failure of the Northern Expedition under his auspices has lead to a disgraced legacy. Both those on the left and right of the party rarely praised Chiang's leadership, criticising his political machinations and his capacity to lead the National Revolutionary Army to victory. Having brewed a distasteful attitude towards him from most of the establishment within the party, many of our esteemed leading figures or commanders would share that negative sentiment. Yet for the lowly footsoldier or fresh cadet, the legacy of the first Headmaster is that of a positive one, a decisive leader whom would've successfully waged the Northern Expedition and revolution to a close had he not been taken away by assassination so soon. In fact, many of Chiang's old clique from within the party and army are spread throughout China, and his influence is still echoed in the halls of Whampoa to this very day. Truly some even argue that we should re-evaluate our perspective on the general, considering the Bushido concepts he had instilled in himself and his soldiers, producing a variety of soldier equal to none, his practical and pragmatic mindset enabling Chiang to make decisions bereft of ideological concerns, and the general loyalty to the revolution the Whampoa graduates exhibit. Embarking on the revival of Whampoa will require an official stance to be taken on the legacy of the first Headmaster, to set an example for all future cadets of the academy."

 GXC.earlygame.072.d: "In our bid to modernise our army, we have successfully lobbied the Russian government to send us military advisors to aid us in creating a force structured along Russian lines. Their experiences in the Russian Civil War has led them to develop the concept of \"Deep Battle\", which we hope they can pass onto us.\n\nIndeed, the old Whampoa began with the help of Red Russian exiles, and though these new advisors are former White Army officers their belief in a patriotic breed of soldier and an inspiring officer class that will fight to the bitter end is quite familiar to us.\n\nIlluminating a new bright partnership between those within [ROOT.GetLeader]'s government is Pyotr von Glazenap, a veteran of Kornilov's shock regiments. Apolitical and keen to focus on military matters, he has had major involvement and experience with the latest reforms of the Russian army as a member of Kornilov and Denikin's staff. Having extensive knowledge of how to organise an army from nothing, he will prove an invaluable asset.\n\nAccompanying Pyotr is Georgy Elvengren, close to both Kornilov and Savinkov. He serves a role akin to a diplomat-soldier, stressing the importance of ideology in an elite army and utilising his considerable experience in organising insurgent guerilla operations against a numerically superior foe. Vsevolod Ivanov meanwhile is a competent cavalry officer with a total war mindset, stressing the importance of mass propaganda and is experienced in fighting within regions of poor infrastructure.\n\nWhilst largely apolitical in Kuomintang matters, all have begun to integrate themselves efficiently into the structure of Whampoa and their mission serves to further bolster our military direction and potentially open a new partnership on the world stage.

Most disagreements are quickly snuffed out by their mentors, yet a very real conflict has begun to brew between the generals of our army.\n\nThe highly politicised nature of the NRA has allowed party grandees from the old revolution such as Xu Chongzhi and Li Liejun to retain considerable influence due to their experiences fighting the National and Constitutional Protection wars.\n\nYet for younger officers such as Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi and Chen Jitang, these old guard figures are hardly fit to lead a modern army. Of course these critiques are not without merit, Xu Chongzhi and Li Liejun have not led troops for a decade thanks to their long exile and even before that they were functionally sidelined by Chiang Kai-shek. The warlord officers claim to have a much stronger bond to Chinese warfare, having fought and bled on the local battlegrounds and honed local tactics.\n\nDespite this, Li Liejun and Xu Chongzhi's prior heroism should not be discounted and both have closely watched the development of the Russian army. Contributing to this dysfunction is the fact that few of our leading generals have a direct link to the old Whampoa, making them eager to entrench themselves in the new one. This disagreement in our methods has reached a point to which [ROOT.GetLeader] has had to deliberate on which side to favour, the reliable methods of the old guard or the unorthodox approach from the warlords."

Spawning a multitude of close networks and relations for life, Whampoa cadets bond through triumph and tragedy no matter the situation and have maintained such bonds even during the tragedy of the Northern Expedition.\n\nThe new generation of Whampoa cadets have a bright future ahead of them, with the merit and lessons of the past generation imprinted onto the next. An opportunity has arisen in said generation, as we can focus our efforts on honing in on a particular revolutionary aspect for the cadets.

In order to control the Guangzhou Navy and further limit the commander's authority, Chen Jitang does not shy away from methods detrimental to the navy. It's becoming more and more common to see army officers as captains of the most important vessels, as the cases of the navy's newest ships show: four torpedo boats acquired from Germany and the Union of Britain two years prior were placed under the command of fresh graduates from the Guangdong Military Political Academy.\n\nThe command of the navy's most recent purchase, a smaller minesweeper, and of a river gunboat, built in the Guangnan Shipyard in Guangzhou, were given directly to Chen Jitang's brother, Chen Weizhou, a salt commissioner by profession. This has proven to be the last straw, with many sailors and officers affiliated with the left refusing to serve under Chen Jitang's appointees, in direct defiance of the Governor.

 GXC.earlygame.100.d: "Established under the zeitgeist of the Westernisation Movement following the Second Opium War, the Guangdong Naval and Land Academy would serve as the precursor institution to the modern day Whampoa Naval Academy. Under the authorisation of Zhang Zhidong, Governor of Guangdong and proponent of modernisation, the Academy was formed in 1887, and originally was staffed by three foreign teachers - one British, and two German. Divided into naval navigation and engineering students, the various students enrolled within the academy would come from across the nation. With the institution later split into Naval and Land schools, it would be renamed the Whampoa Naval Academy in the late 1800s.\n\nWith the addition of other institutions such as the Naval Industrial Academy and Naval Torpedo Academy, the curriculum would be revamped and the institution renamed to the Guangdong Naval Industrial Academy. With five years of preparatory courses and five years of undergraduate courses, graduates of the academy would be sent abroad thereafterwards to study further. Producing some of the nation's best naval officers, its subjects ranged from navigation, naval gun drills, and communications to mathematics, physics, and English. Renamed after Xinhai, it would see troubled finances in the Warlord Era, and ultimately be merged into the Whampoa Military Academy in 1924.\n\nIn 1930 local naval officers petitioned Mayor Chen Lianbo to reopen the institution following its closure after the Northern Expedition, but were refused. Now deeming it an appropriate time for the revival of the Academy, [ROOT.GetLeader] has been tasked with the appointment of the new institution's leading figure, its principal. Three options have presented themselves. There is the British educated Jiang Xiyuan, noted for his ties to Chen Jitang, the young guard alumni and graduate Li Qingwen, and finally the veteran, one-time Governor of Guangdong and Naval Minister Tang Tingguang."

 GXC.earlygame.101.d: "Whilst China as a nation is perhaps particularly derided for the military strategies and tactics utilised in the Warlord Era — with notable incidents of vastly superior numbers being trumped by simple morale, or lack of coordination, and more — it is still a period of the nation's rich history wherein military science has advanced, and concepts proposed that rival even the greatest thinkers of the West. Perhaps most prevalent is that of the Social Darwinist adherence to Total War and considerations of the mobilisation of China's people for National Defence. One of the most famous adherents of such a philosophy being that of the late Cai E, and the iterations provided by the legendary Jiang Baili.\n\nYet the nation has borne numerous other strains of military theory, most notably Li Erkang's focus on science and modernisation to supplement insistence on Bushido and Warrior Spirit, and an emphasis on the tactical engagements of a battle, not the strategic mobilisation of a people for a war. Similarly there is the class of officers educated in the German theories of war, advocating the mobilisation of industry, or insistence upon officer initiative to win a war. Or even that of the Kuomintang, such as Bai Chongxi's Citizen-Soldier propensity, Zhu De's Guerrilla Mobile War, or Yang Jie's \"War is Life\" philosophy.\n\nGuangdong too has its own theoretical heroes. Comparable to all of the aforementioned, Li Yuri's theories are perhaps the most novel, yet brimming with potential. Young and vigorous, Li has set forward to make his mark on international military history. Focusing on over 2000 years of China's inherent martial tradition and writings, he has recently published a full analysis of Sun Tzu's Art of War and its applications. Achieving remarkable success, it is reported that he hopes to publish a military paper, called \"World Military Science\", documenting his research on German theoretical schools, Russian doctrine, and that of the International's."

 GXC.earlygame.105.t: "Composition of the Yue Army"
 GXC.earlygame.105.d: "Under the proposed Federalist Chinese project, the army has always been a matter of much debate. Provincialism inherently clashing with the concept of a national army, with proposals for provincial armies that constitute one national army considered fruitless due to inherent inefficiencies. Perhaps a symbolic microcosm of such a structure is the inherently feudalistic nature of the present Yue Army. Even before its reconstitution following [ROOT.GetLeader]'s return and victory over the other warlords of Liangguang, the Yue Army was similar to the majority of other military compositions within China. A disparate gathering of conscripts and professional soldiers all tied to their commanding officers as opposed to a national idea or concept.\n\nOf course, such an assortment was not out of the ordinary for the time, with units such as the National Revolutionary Army with an adherence to ideology and Sun Yat-sen being standouts from the norm. As indicated by the American Consulate, Chen Jiongming's army of the time consisted of 30,000 New Army Soldiers, 20,000 patrol guards, 2,000 police officers, all locally recruited. And in the present, not much has changed, or rather, perhaps it has deteriorated.\n\nPresently the Liangguang Armies are a composite force comprised of a mixture of warlord forces; ranging from auxiliaries attributed to the likes of Hong Zhaolin, the mixed forces of Liu Zhenhuan, Ye Ju, Yang Kunru, or even the comparitively elite forces recruited from Old Guangxi's divisions. With such a context in mind, and with redoubled efforts for military modernisation, a rather perplexing dilemma has been raised to the high command. Should they seek to reorganise and condense the military forces of their erstwhile allies, potentially incurring their wrath or insurbordination? Or should they focus on applying modern methodology and organisation only to new units, leaving the warlords their independence."

 GXC.earlygame.106.t: "National Reconstruction and the Military Arm"
 GXC.earlygame.106.d: "The struggle between an equal balance between the military and civilian spheres has undoubtedly been a vocal, violent, and vicious one within the Warlord Era. Warlords of local polities act akin both to Marshals and Presidents, with some in the upper echelons even carrying both positions legally. This has of course, raised much controversy, and there exists the ever continuing march towards nominal delimitation of suit and sword. Most prevalent within the Federalist movement would be the positions of Governor Zhao Hengti and Governor Tang Jiyao, who both liken themselves to elected civilians, not generals leading an army. And the case is no different with Chen. Preferring to act in a civilian capacity — no less due perhaps to his poor military record — he has left most military affairs in the hands of Ye Ju, his Commander-in-Chief.\n\nHowever during Chen's time as an active commander his greatest successes can be attributed to the conduct of his military, albeit not on the field. Instead Chen's successes emerge from his army's national reconstruction endeavours, such as in the Fujian Campaign. During his time in Shantou, he had set up an arsenal in Shanwei, established an extensive network of military supply stations, and a county road building programme — to facilitate both military and commercial transportation, and organised local militia and guerrilla units to suppress banditry.\n\nAnd it would appear, in much the same manner, that Chen's army are engaging in such national reconstruction efforts yet again. Albeit, unlike in Fujian, Ye Ju has seen more stubborn resistance to his attempts to prepare Guangdong and the local region for national unification. Both gentry and peasantry have not taken particularly kindly to the interfering of the military in their daily matters, even if only to solicit aid for provincial reconstruction. As such, complaints have reached [ROOT.GetLeader], insisting that he \"rein in\" his subordinates."

 GXC.earlygame.111.d: "With the ironic refounding of Whampoa under the pretenses of its original enemies, the Federalist movement and accompanying unreliable warlords, the Federalist army has entered into something of an odd situation. Whampoa was famed for producing perhaps the best military force in the whole nation. Their victories were many, such as in the First Eastern Expedition where the untested and swiftly trained Whampoa cadets managed to forge their reputation with blood in the Battle of Mianhu.\n\nFurther adding to the irony, the First Eastern Expedition was originally supervised by Yang Ximin and Liu Zhenhuan alongside the Whampoa Cadets and the Pro-Sun Guangdong Units, yet in the interim after the First Expedition, the former duo would revolt and defect, only to be utterly defeated by the infant National Revolutionary Army. In the Second Eastern Expedition, the Guangdong Army would almost kill Chiang, only to again be defeated, forcing Hong Zhaolin and Lin Hu into Fujian. Following the expulsion of Deng Benyin, the Pro-Chen forces in the region were utterly annihilated. And yet here they have returned to power, under new and old hands alike.\n\nWhilst palpably the turn of events is not lost on anyone within the high command, there still remains the issue of staffing the new Whampoa with proper faculty aligned to the values of the nation's new army. The position of principal has the capacity of immeasurable influence, and so has been jockeyed by numerous military cliques for the acquisition of the position. The three most viable contenders started with Lin Hu's candidacy. Moderately loyal to Chen, but a force of his own right, Lin's ties to the Old Guangxi Clique raise him as an object of suspicion. Secondly there is Wei Bangping, a man who remained neutral during the Sun-Chen power struggle, but found himself shuffled out of the Nationalist's ranks, and notably never joined the KMT. Lastly, there is Yang Ximin, making another bid for some influence and power."

 GXC.earlygame.112.d: "With increasing efforts to reform, restructure, and modernise the military, many of the government's initiatives have received some spotlight attention in the media. Most recently there has been the rather heavily publicised case of Zhang Junmai, and his writings on the merits and faults of both the present reform efforts for the Federalist military, and the legacy of the National Revolutionary Army of which the former aims to emulate. Starting his piece, published in the party periodical, Zhang addresses the present situation of the once famed and renowned National Revolutionary Army, considering its downfall on the conclusion of the Northern Expedition not to be due to lack of merit, or inherent weakness in its organisational structure, but with German Intervention.\n\nConsidering the circumstances, Zhang even hypothesises that without Germany's landing at Guangzhou and the utter failure of the 1st and 4th Army to alleviate its capture, perhaps the Kuomintang would've managed to unite the nation. Praising the NRA for its great successes in triumphing against the majority of the warlord forces, Zhang draws up the strengths of the NRA to be in the heavily politicised academic curriculum in Whampoa, the subsequent absolute dedication of Whampoa cadets to the party's ideology, and its immeasurable popular support and discipline. Of course, Zhang levies none of these compliments onto the Kuomintang itself.\n\nAdvocating for increased politicisation of the army, and the construction of true adherents to Democratic ideology, Zhang's periodical has met much praise in ex-Kuomintang circles, yet much debridement in the cliques of the Old Federalists. The most notable opponent of such an initiative is none other than the core of the Yue Army, Ye Ju and his associates. Stipulating that such a move could result in an army holding the Republic at gunpoint for some sort of lofty ideal, or even a similar cult to that of the Guofu based around Chen Jiongming."

 GXC.earlygame.113.d: "It would be apparent that despite all the trappings of an army following in the mold laid forth by the Whampoa Military Academy, the Federalist National Defence Army, or Guofangjun, the inherent fractioned nature of a warlord army still shines through in certain aspects of its military forces. Ranging from Federalist loyalists, to Guangdong Army compatriots, Guangxi aficionados, and everything in-between, it is truly a motley force joined not too dissimiarly to say, the Zhili or Fengtian Cliques. United by bonds of mutual ties, loyalty, or otherwise financial investment, they nonetheless have fought side-by-side.\n\nIncluding a number of old-guard revolutionaries, the Federalist army sports the likes of the well-respected Wei Bangping. Noted for serving as an early Japanese-educated officer of the successive Guangdong based revolutionary governments, he stands fiercely by his tenets that \"military personnel have no party\", continually resisting any membership to any political organisation. Similarly there is the case of Liu Zhenhuan, a long indentured power player within southern led military-political developments, especially within Guangxi. In contrast to Wei, Liu actively utilises his political affiliations, notably with the Political Science Clique, and the China Democratic League parties, and especially with forces in Yunnan and Guangxi, all to strengthen his position.\n\nOf course, amongst the ranks are far worse offenders in terms of eccentricities. Chen Jitang, and his informal \"New Guangdong Clique\" form a nucleus of ex-Kuomintang officers within the ranks. On the opposite end of the spectrum, there's the forces of Deng Benyin, angling to retain his stranglehold on Qiongya, and even that of Hong Zhaolin — focused on sustaining wealth inflows through the opium trade. All-in-all, the military still has a long road to travel if it is to be the selfless guardian of the republic."

 ##NPA Unique Guangxi Style Military Events (116-120)

 GXC.earlygame.116.t: "Role of the Zizhijun Model"
 GXC.earlygame.116.d: "With the reorganisation of the military on uniquely Guangxi origin doctrinal philosophy, there have been many attributions to the Old Guangxi Clique's Zizhijun model of division, wherein local guerilla militias would be supplemented by regular formations that retained enough mobility to swiftly avoid battles if necessary. Such an innovation has retained Old Guangxi's strength in the region even when they've been utterly forced out, a notable case being the rapid return of Lu Rongting following the National Revolutionary Army's collapse. Effectively acting as a precursor to the novel Citizen-Soldier militia model of the military's new doctrine, many of the Guangxi native commanding officers, especially the likes of Lin Hu, have advocated for a modernised take on the organisational model.\n\nRunning in contrary to this are the novel, westernised, and comparitively elite forces commanded directly by Lu Rongting and Ma Ji, otherwise known as the 1st Division, and the Model Battalion respectively. Focused on tactics learnt from the West, namely the German Military Mission, they have retained a serious edge on much of the local competition, albeit not without issue. With certain difficulties in supplying the 1st Division in Guangxi's largely rural environment, they have found the most usage on the few tracked roads of the interior, or otherwise urban centres.\n\nOf course, the Zizhijun model has its own critiques, notably those of the professional officer corps, who insist upon trained soldiers rather than county militia to form the bulk of the Liangguang military. Many of those aforementioned voices arise most prominently from officers not native to Guangxi, such as within Guangdong, who find no attachment to the Guangxi way of warfare."

 GXC.earlygame.117.t: "Autonomy at Home, Autonomy in the Army"
 GXC.earlygame.117.d: "As an unforeseen outgrowth of the army's focus on regionalism, self-reliance, and local autonomy, the \"Guangxi Style\" military doctrine has borne a rather unbridled sense of county regionalism amongst the ranks of the Citizen-Soldiers. Whilst the traditional Chinese militia system would commonly see militia either refuse to fight outside their local jurisdiction, even if bandits crossed boundaries often, or otherwise be looked down upon outside their home territory, the Citizen-Soldier model has seen an even more fierce uptick in loyalism towards the county subunit, rather than the provincial, or even national.\n\nUltimately not really an issue in local matters, as their fierce dedication to their neighbourhood has been a rather positive boon in terms of anti-banditry operations, it has proven itself a noticeable headache in approaches to the national stage, as the mustered citizen-soldier militia prove unwilling to fight, especially outside of provincial boundaries. Such thoughts are further aggravated due to the recent history in Liangguang, with Guangdong and Guangxi soldiers alike treating their respective counterparts poorly, looting and raiding their homes and fields during occupations."

 GXC.earlygame.121.t: "Reconstituting the German Military Mission"
 GXC.earlygame.121.d: "Perhaps one of the most fruitful boons from the Sino-German partnership between the Zhili and the German Empire was in the form of the German Military Advisor Mission. Tasked with transforming a disparate force of hodgepodge warlord conscript forces into an army to rival not only the Japanese trained units of the Fengtian Clique, but to be comparable to a modernised military force. Bringing with them theoretical know-how, technical knowledge, industrial expertise, and the laying of the groundwork for the conduct of \"modern\" warfare on the Chinese frontline.\n\nWith the German advisor's efforts, the Central Government's military industry saw rapid evolution and investment from German Industrialists, and whilst the economic development was stellar, the actual reform of the military left much to be desired. With Warlords sometimes utterly refusing any pretense of modernisation under fear of losing their influence, the so-called \"60 Division Plan\" proposed in 1935 by the German advisors would've seen the mass demobilisation of excess military units, resulting in merely 60 elite, well-trained divisions for the whole nation (under Zhili control), and yet it was a half-flag endeavour.\n\nNaturally, such a matter was met with contention, especially in Liangguang wherein the number of men under your command directly related to your influence and power in its patchwork administration. And yet, such misgivings have come to pass as the Germans are invited once more into the region. Albeit, a loose air of suspicion still remains. Not for fear of loss of influence, but the loss of statehood, as the German financiers of late gobble up local industries in an almost proto-colonial fashion. Brewing an air of nascent anti-concessionist fervour, it has further deepened the divide between the Jingxing Society sponsored Shen Hongying, anti-German Merchant Corps, and the independently minded Young Guangxi faction."

 GXC.earlygame.122.d: "The deliberation of tactical and operational authority to the junior officers leading their soldiers in the field has long been proved to be the dominant form of warfare in the era of the German Empire, albeit not an entirely original theoretical concept belonging to them. It has seen adoption, cosntruction, or utilisation in various militaries around the globe, and similarly China brought forth its own form of Mission-Type Tactics, notably within the Huguojun of the National Protection War, or the National Revolutionary Army.\n\nWhilst the aforementioned military forces preferred revolutionary spirit, bushido, isolated 1-on-1 engagements combined with manoeuvre warfare, the adoption of such a doctrine within the German-trained sphere of the Chinese military has largely come under the banner of the larger doctrinal dispute within the German high-command. As the various officer sent to train Chinese commanders and their soldiers bring with them different interpretations of the evolution of Germany's manoeuvre warfare. However, ultimately within Liangguang the various German military cliques have brought forward a culmination of their ideas.\n\nCombining merits from the Reformisten and Die Fronde, the Liangguang military has developed a knack for the centralised, professional and modern army of the 60 Division Plan, with the heavy emphasis upon a nationalistic, ideologised military focused on the industrial mobilisation of the country in order to conduct the prophesised \"Total War\" against Japan.\n\nUnderneath this doctrinal current however, is the amassing of influence under the pro-German Jingxing Society, as their ties to the German economic sector facilitate the modernisation of Liangguang's military, and it is evidently clear that they desire a very specific outcome for Liangguang's political scene, whether [ROOT.GetLeader] is privy to it or not."

 GXC.earlygame.200.t: "The Rice Glut"
 GXC.earlygame.200.d: "The aftershocks of Black Monday continue to reverberate across Liangguang. While the government struggled to put a lid over the initial crisis and the people managed the best they could, the disaster laid bare many of the core issues festering within our agriculture sector. Perhaps most concerning is the horrific underutilisation of provincial land and fixation on cash crop development which has compounded into Guangxi one of the most economically deprived provinces of China.\n\nThere is no place where this is more apparent than in the current rice glut plaguing the province, where in a tragically ironic turn of events some villages suffer from famine while others a glut of un-exportable rice. The certain cause of this crisis seems to be the poor quality of roads within Guangxi. For many years there existed but one motor road between Nanning to Wuming, said to lead directly to the personal residence of Lu Rongting for his own consumption.\n\nIn the post Northern Expedition environment, Guangxi authorities had worked to build 1000 miles of new highway whilst also operating several new bus lines from Guigang to Nanjing to Wuzhou. These subsequent road building initiatives had great promise but most have been mismanaged, unfunded, or generally inconsistent in implementation. Even now, many of our districts and villages remain disconnected by road, still relying upon an inefficient yet intricate system of inter-village ox, horse and handcart paths to help peasants move their grain from motor roads to distant markets.\n\nAll of this has compounded into the sluggish transport of vitally needed grains from the fields to the tables. [ROOT.GetLeader] and others within the government promise this year will be the last agricultural crisis the people will ever see, swearing they will ensure the completion of the long-promised highway constructions programs and moreover that this is but the first step in a permanent solution to the rural plight."

 GXC.earlygame.201.t: "The Strife of Guangzhou"
 GXC.earlygame.201.d: "The crippling effects brought on by the tragedy of \"Black Monday\" have finally materialised. With our once meagre developing economy having been shattered by the collapse of the Berlin Stock Market, [ROOT.GetLeader]'s government is left to pick up the pieces. The devastation continues: factories and shops close, workers continue to be discarded to the streets, basic necessities remain out of reach of many. The arteries pumping blood into our economic capital of Guangzhou falter, and the heart bleeds. The ever present economic inequality has only worsened since the crash.\n\nIt was not always like this. The Cantonese system, which forced foreigners to trade exclusively through the Pearl River Delta, made the region fabulously wealthy. But the traumatic forcible opening of Chinese markets by foreign imperialism, declining central government authority and the aftershocks of the Xinhai revolution shattered the old status quo.\n\nThe power jockeying by various factions within Liangguang over the years has only added to the uncertainty by siphoning funding, manpower, and government attention to support the revolving doors of governments built atop it. The National Protection Alliance, the Kuomintang, the Federalists, the Merchant Corps, and even the Old Guangxi Clique have at various points made Guangdong their home base. All exploiting the local economy to finance their military campaigns, Canton finds its light snuffed out.\n\nReports are rising of urban tensions, with class strife between merchants and proletariat as well as nationalist conflict tearing at the very foundation of Canton's identity. However not all is lost, leading bureaucrats have strived to resolve these pressing issues through the implementation of a revolutionary \"Yue-Gui\" plan, an ambitious three year plan aimed at revitalising failed industries and finding a lasting solution to our economic troubles. But as they begin to roll out the Yue-Gui plan, many wonder what shape it will take."

 GXC.earlygame.202.t: "Youth Education Programme"
 GXC.earlygame.202.d: "Despite Liangguang's comparatively modern appearance and influx of wealth, education of the populace has remained a difficult mountain to climb. Despite the formation of modern educational methods within newly funded schools, these efforts remained largely directed urban areas such and the metropolitan population. To truly bring Liangguang into the 20th century, we must strive to not only enlighten those within our cities, but simultaneously those within the rural areas - particularly in Guangxi. However, both funding and teachers are in drastic short supply and yet illiteracy seems likely to persist another generation.\n\nTo remedy this, some radical if unfailingly down-to-earth leaders in Guangxi have advocated for a completely new multi-stage approach, away from the traditional approaches of the intelligentsia. Firstly each village and ward will be required to turn one of their local temples into a primary school, or otherwise build a new one with community contribution. This will broadly expand education opportunities to the masses, as every settlement will have the capacity to teach their young. Secondly a new secondary school system will be established to offer a parallel academic curriculum to that of traditional secondary schooling. Instead of academic subjects aimed at preparing students for elitist universities, this new system will provide a more practical set of courses and subjects. Three year courses covering the sciences, including social sciences alongside natural sciences. This would simplify the mostly literature biased subject matter of current secondary schools and produce generations of future workers capable of progressing in the world.\n\nWhilst there are pragmatic voices within our government that raise valid issues such as the lack of teaching staff, or overriding the nurturing of future intellectuals, other officials are aware of the dire situation in the provinces, and see that decisive action is needed."

 GXC.earlygame.202.b: "Alas, we cannot spare the resources."

 GXC.earlygame.203.t: "The Tax Incentive"
 GXC.earlygame.203.d: "For as long as one can remember, Liangguang has lamented the various extortionate taxes burdened on to its citizens. With lack of stability and central control, many local warlords or bandits have applied overlapping fees that bleed the peasants and elites alike of their wealth. Naturally, the provincial government (much less the central government) sees close to none of this currency flowing into their treasury, with most of these levies ending up in the pockets of local despots and their thugs.\n\nThe provincial government is not free from blame however, as they too have fallen to various exorbitant methods to extract revenue from the population. These include the euphemistically named \"Defence Fund\" tax (levied on gambling) which contributes to 20% of tax revenue and the \"Consolidated Tax\" which introduced excise duties on rolled tobacco, flour, cotton yarn, matches and cement which makes up 33% of tax revenue and 30% of total provincial revenue. There is also the \"Opium-Suppression Tax\" producing 28% of all taxes and 25% of total provincial revenue, alongside various other minor taxes on salt, wine, stamps and additional customs duties.\n\nThe implementation of all of these assorted taxes and duties has led to a bureaucratic nightmare, and general inefficiencies in our markets. Two options have presented themselves to our revitalised government. One camp presents the ability to utilise the rather... creative methods currently in place to extract revenue further, of course streamlining wherever they can and stamping out the local warlord taxes to reduce the strain on the government. The other option is to instead utilise a more pragmatic approach, exorcising all unnecessary taxes, combining what remains, eradicating the warlord taxes and ensuring the process is swift like water. While neither disagree on streamlining the bureaucratic elements, the final choice remains with [ROOT.GetLeader] on his idea of a better Liangguang."

 GXC.earlygame.220.t: "Guangxi's Crossroads"
 GXC.earlygame.220.d: "Straddled between Yunnan and Guangdong province, Guangxi province has a history stretching back as far as Chinese history. Sometimes called the Mountain Kingdom (shan-guo), mountainous ranges sprawl throughout the entirety of the province. Because of this, the province is home to many unique subcultures isolated by their unforgiving surroundings. Sporting only a few rich agricultural areas such as Yulin, Guangxi is one of China's poorest provinces, with the only consolation being its natural beauty. Indeed, Guangxi's beautiful landscape attracted many writers and artists, garnering a reputation for unorthodoxy.\n\nCoalescence of mountain poverty, apathy from Beijing, and a tradition of liberty with a heterodox messianic ideology created the spark for a conflict deadlier than the Weltkrieg, the Taiping Rebellion. Guangxi was the first of many provinces to be swept up by revolutionary fervour of the Heavenly King. Though Hong's crusade ended in disaster, Guangxi remained much the same: a province strife with poverty and riddled with banditry. Some of these bandits and former Taiping fighters crossed the border into French Vietnam, creating headaches for Paris for the latter half of the 19th century.\n\nThe opening of the west river jolted the province from its isolation into a new world of republicanism and militarism. Today, Guangxi's navigation and commerce is heavily dependent on rivers due to a lack of railroads, with 95.5% of the province's exports flowing downstream to Hong Kong and Canton. The economic woes of the province have not gone unnoticed, with one of the goals of the three-year plan being ending Guangxi's poverty. However, there are disagreements on why poverty exists in Guangxi. The prevailing theory among intellectuals is that deep-seated economic inequality is the cause, however many commercial leaders have argued that the true cause of the poverty is the province's failure to utilise available arable land and its vast mineral riches."

 GXC.earlygame.221.t: "Roading Building Competitions"
 GXC.earlygame.221.d: "With the Guangxi reconstruction project in full swing, we are already experiencing its boon. The most successful part of the project is the infrastructure initiative, which has seen so many roads built in Guangxi that it is now third only to Guangdong and Shandong in terms of numbers of roads. One downside though is that most of the construction benefited military needs of the government instead of the economy. In conjunction with the Guangxi infrastructure project, the Guangdong government has built the first major highway network system in Guangdong. These roads have helped greatly with our efforts in curtailing banditry throughout the two guangs, to the delight of the locals.\n\nThe government has also taken to organising road-building competitions. In the Yongning Experimental Subdistrict (Yongning Shi Yan Chu), various village militia units compete with each other on road building projects. The results have borne great fruit for our efforts in transportation modernisation. Now, the people of Guangxi can avoid having to use slow boats on rivers to travel into the interior. Guangxi rivers are notoriously unreliable, dropping around 50 to 60 feet in the west during the winter, only to rapidly grow to great heights in mid March and peak by June.\n\nDespite all this progress, the people have seen little change to their financial circumstances. Corvee labour and unemployed men provided much of the working force for the Guangxi reconstruction project, and many suffered from abuse. New surveys indicate that desperate poverty and backwardness is still rampant, and although the Guangxi government is aware, only time will tell if they intend to remedy the situation with drastic measures."

 GXC.earlygame.222.t: "Granary System"
 GXC.earlygame.222.d: "The current Guangxi credit system, much like the province's terrain, is coarse, rough, and irritating. Guangxi farmers have to compete with the economic power of grain wholesalers, giving them little control over market price. Wholesalers could buy at harvest, wait until spring and sell for double the price. Typically, there are three types of credit arrangements. The first one is the borrowing of cash. However, cash loans are exceedingly rare. Another credit arrangement was the selling of agricultural futures. However, the most common type of credit arrangement was the borrowing of grains, typically seed grain. Regardless, the general consensus among farmers is that the interest rates are too high - some 20-50% per year. Six year loans charge a full year's interest at 30%.\n\nIn an attempt to control supply, the local government had tried to set up a granary system that bought grain during times of glut and sold during times of scarcity. In today's Guangxi, this system is archaic and poorly run. Provincial regulations stipulated that if a person wished to sell land, they first had to try to sell it to the village government. Granaries were supposed to be built near road systems, but encountered three major stumbling blocks.\n\nFirstly, the government lacks the funds to support such a system, as much of the allocated funds are redirected towards military spending. Secondly, the system lacks trained personnel to maintain the system, in part due to the low funding. Thirdly, the system is not properly understood by the general population of Guangxi, so they do not partake in the system. Perhaps in the future Guangxi will have a fair system of grain production, but today it remains only a far flung hope of the idealistic."

[GXC.GetLeader] hatched a plan to buy necessary equipment at reduced prices, from the Honolulu Iron Works in the USA and the Skoda Works Company in Austria-Hungary. However, there are even greater schemes to be hatched. Several cunning ministers have approached [GXC.GetLeader] with an even more devious plan to buy and sell tons of sugar for a huge profit. They suggest that this be done before the refineries from the three-year plan are finished with construction.\n\nThey propose that we buy copious amounts of sugar in Hong Kong and then load it up on Huo Zhiting's Liangguang Heyi Company anti-opium smuggling vessels to bypass customs, and then sell at an inflated price in Guangdong. This will be followed by an increase in duties on imported sugar to encourage local growth with loans to protect the domestic market, in conjunction with an ironic crackdown on smuggling. This would greatly increase our coffers, but will [GXC.GetLeader] stoop down to this level of financial banditry?"

The most well renowned of these reclusive hubs — perhaps in part due to the LKMT connection within Paris and London — was the MinGan Insurgency, boasting the aforementioned dual Provisional Action Committee members, alongside famed servicemen like Li Jishen.\n\nHaving been a Kuomintang movement through and through, their connection and influence within their home province of Guangdong was comparatively paltry, as all of their potential supporters are consistently challenged by the militant agrarian Peng Pai, who largely cut off all contact with MinGan and its affiliated cells in order to focus entirely on cultivating and developing his own revolutionary movement, the Guangdong Farmers' Association, with its hubs in the Southwest.\n\nWith his new grasp on power, [ROOT.GetLeader] has embarked on a mission to reconnect the two revolutionary movements, KMT and GFA, in order to yield a mutually beneficial agreement of unity and support.

Yet, the plight of the rural peasant is important to numerous Chinese intellectuals who call for moderate rural reform. However China is a nation in which moderatism cowers in the wake of radicalism, and on both sides of the issue, Landlord and Peasant, the moderates capable of compromise are not as numerous as the intellectuals like to believe."

 GXC.earlygame.240.t: "Trade Fair in Liuzhou"
 GXC.earlygame.240.d: "When China came into increasing contact with the west, the Imperial Government in Beijing saw fit to enact a policy known as the Canton System for the purposes of controlling trade with the west. This occurred by funnelling all trade to the city of Guangzhou, leaving all trade in the city being controlled by Chinese merchants. These merchants became known as Hangs (Hongs), operating their trading enterprises from a neighbourhood outside Guangzhou known as the Thirteen Factories. During the reign of Qianlong, the Hangs were sanctioned as a monopoly known as the Gongxing (Cohong), after which the Guangdong Customs Supervisor (Hu Bu/Hoppo) and Viceroy of the Two Guangs supervised foreign trade under the Gongxing.\n\nThe Canton System was abolished upon the signing of the Treaty of Nanjing, which would see China open up trade with the west. Although this marked the end of the Cantonese System officially, Guangzhou remained as an important trading port. The city has retained economic relevance all the way through the latter half of the 19th century, and even past the Xinhai Revolution. In 1929, the Guangxi government opened a trade fair in Liuzhou, a city bordering the Pearl River. A Bureau of Exports was also established with 500,000 Yuan, balancing exports and imports. With the Three Year Plan in full swing, many have begun to debate the trade policies which would be best for the two provinces. Some say that the province should focus on exports, which would continue Guangzhou's trade dominance in the region. Others have theorised a new more autarkic future for the province's future in order to prevent western imperialists from leaching from our natural wealth."

In order to meet the goals of the Three Year Plan, the government has begun coal rationing so that essential projects can receive necessary resources. This has not gone unnoticed by the workers, who see the government as neglecting the people of Liangguang. The Syndicates of Guangzhou have been particularly aggravated, orchestrating a large protest against the government of [GXC.GetLeader].\n\nAlthough unlikely to do any major damage to the city, the protestors have been a nuisance to our state owned businesses, preventing the flow of commerce. The military has drawn up plans to squash the protest through force, presenting their solution to [GXC.GetLeader]. While this would end the protest quickly, it would also hurt relations with the workers and lower our legitimacy to the common people. Some government officials have advised [GXC.GetLeader] to simply allow the protest to run its course. This solution would help with the government's efforts in increasing popular support, but our businesses would suffer for a longer period of time. The government awaits [GXC.GetLeader]'s decision."

 GXC.earlygame.242.d: "The streets of Guangzhou bustle with life. Everyday, foreign traders enter the city, bringing more wealth to our streets. Clearly the government's efforts at developing a reformed Cantonese System have already borne fruit. However, there is a cost to this flow of wealth. Business is mostly conducted by the Merchant Corps, who have begun to resemble the Gongxing monopoly of the Imperial era. What's more, [GXC.GetLeader]'s alliance with Chen Lianbo has emboldened the Merchant Corps. Many rich merchants have begun their own turf wars on the streets vying for dominance with their rivals. Caught in the crossfire are smaller merchants and the common people. Powerful merchants have raised prices of essential goods to extortionist levels, much to the chagrin of the poor.\n\nWorse yet, some corrupt businessmen have even begun to push around smaller government officials. This has pushed the Guangdong Assembly to call Chen Lianbo, leader of the Merchant Corps, to answer for the various abuses committed under his watch. Chen has apologised for allowing the merchant guilds to grow out of control, but has only made vague promises to keep turf wars to a minimum and end the bullying of smaller government officials. Many have called upon [GXC.GetLeader] to punish the Merchant Corps for their insolence to make sure this doesn't happen again. Others push [GXC.GetLeader] to let Chen Lianbo leave with nothing more than a slap on the wrist, so that the Merchant Corps and the Liangguang government can continue their close cooperation which has already brought much wealth into the two Guangs. After great deliberation, [GXC.GetLeader] makes up his mind."

In tandem with these moves, he has also administered the preparation of a \"social welfare bureau\", aimed at providing welfare, alongside cultural and moral education reinforcement to the populace.\n\nWithin this crusade to return responsibility to the citizenry, the governor has also developed a Three-Year Plan of \"Rectification\" and \"Reconstruction\" in which his provincial government cooperates with various organisations - such as the Guangzhou Municipal Relief Institute - to help the poor, old and infirm, implement military training, and mandatory moral training to all. The governor has even gone as far as to implement three free provincial government clinics, aimed at shopkeepers, peddlers, boat people, alongside six additional hospitals, and has begun assisting unemployed emigrants. More controversially, the governor has implemented a \"Honour Confucius, Study the Classics\" social instruction campaign, intended to ensure an orderly and well functioning society of morality.\n\nSome within the party fear that by making such moves, no matter how benevolent, the governor is circumventing the National Government itself. Some even claim this is all a blatant power play to cement Chen Jitang's role within the daily life of those in Guangdong.

With humble roots as an expanded version of National Guangdong Higher Normal School, it was later merged with the National Guangdong University, Guangdong Public Agricultural College and Guangdong Public Hosheng University into a large institution dubbed \"Sun Yat-sen University\". After absorbing Guangdong Public Medical University and Guangdong Public Industrial College, it was renamed by Liao Zhongkai to \"National Sun Yat-sen University\" after the party founder's passing.

Discussions about its future leadership however remains open.\n\nZou Lu would represent a return of the university to its original leadership, a staunch ally of Hu Hanmin within the Western Hills clique and senior member of the Kuomintang. On the other hand, Zhu Jiahua has been put forward by more conservative factions as a continuation of the university's existing faculty leadership, a geologist of great repute, relatively neutral Republican political opinions except for his noted Germanophilia.

With such action, there has been a rather unequal distribution of funds towards transport cooperatives, due to their capacity to allow for broader integration of railroads across provinces, ultimately considered a priority for the military.\n\nThis is not without backlash, as the peasantry throughout the provinces clamber and call for a focus on credit, consumer and production coops to satisfy their own needs, as opposed to those of the soldiery, with certain masses of peasantry deeming this tyranny and resisting government efforts to establish more cooperatives."

Prioritising stability as much as possible, it ultimately aimed for a smooth transition of power from the \"local bullies and evil gentry\" towards the common populace, however the expansion of the cooperative movement has obviously met its striking opposition.\n\nWith a combined broad distrust from organised labour, fearing the loss of their industrial jobs towards cooperative labour, and merchants alongside monopoly capitalists, fearing the loss of control over their profits or distribution networks, many within the government have been calling for the programme to be toned down in order to soothe opposition. Others however, are of the mindset that if the gentry believe that coops are Communism, why not give it to them?

Critical to all functions of governance is that of the economy, for it directly dictates the splendor of the people, and wealth of the nation.\n\nTo continue onwards, Bai believes that in the ancient days of China, Confucian sages discounted economics, refusing to discuss \"li\" (profit), only \"tao te\" (the way of virtue). However in those days, China was self-sufficient, and the study of economics could be ignored in favour of moral principles, with the first ancient scholar to concern himself with economcs to be Xunzi. Further arguing that the West in the 19th century revolved everything around the influence of economics, this has only increased with the recent developments in Germany, France and Russia.\n\nThis technological interpretation of Chinese poverty rather than a distributional view has seen a series of oppostional statements from most leftist scholars, albeit has also witnessed recognition with the theories of J. Losing Buck, who argued that the cause of village poverty in China was that there was too high a ratio of labour to land. 80% of Chinese farms are too small to be economical even under Chinese conditions, and that the introduction of mechanised laboru saving devices would create even greater excesses of labour in which the economy was not equipped to absorb."

They also noted that the rattan carpentry and bamboo workshops were already in operation, though more were expected.\n\nDespite the grandeur, not everyone has been convinced. Critics charge that those actually receiving housing have mostly been military men and that these facilities mostly serve as a glorified barracks for Guangdong clique loyalists.

That's the only place which is rent-free, spacious, and well ventilated.\" Indeed, as our new government takes inventory of these mass housing blocs, reviews of records of those who did receive housing indicated that most were soldiers affiliated with Chen Jitang's army or students returning from abroad.

Of particular importance to the landlocked province is the agricultural sector, which make up the bulk of their exports, though they have also been keen on cultivating a local industrial base as well.\n\nA trade bureau has been established in Wuzhou to regulate imports and enforce quality control on exports. Heavy tariffs have been implemented on many imports and in some cases (like luxury items) they have been outright banned. Efforts of foreign concessionists to enforce treaty stipulations have been largely bypassed by central government inaction and also heavy taxation on Chinese distributors who sold foreign goods, causing outside cigarettes and alcohol to disappear from the shelves.\n\nIn order to bolster domestic production, protectionist economic policies have been mixed with private-public joint-enterprises that have provided tax concessions and subsidies to these businesses. Much of this programme has been funded by the mass export of tung oil, which makes up nearly a third of Guangxi's exports along with mining products. Every household in Guangxi has been ordered to plant ten tung seedlings per able-bodied man every year, with county tung committees ensuring compliance.\n\nNot every sector has been as thoroughly controlled as agriculture and industry however. Critics of this heavy-handed government intervention point out that the mining industry laments under such management, despite comprising a substantive part of regional revenue. The government has previously taken to a lighter hand, selling licenses to private companies for tin and manganese as well as largely leaving the rest to private ventures.

In order to raise money for the government, a host of new tariffs have been put in place by Chen Jitang, known as the \"special taxes on foreign agricultural products and miscellaneous items\". While on paper it a tariff on foreign-made goods, in practice, it has also led to the taxation of goods from other provinces in China outside of Guangdong.\n\nThis provision is especially contentious because it breaks from the Kuomintang's nationalist rhetoric, and has been denounced by other Governors both outside and inside the Kuomintang sphere as selfish and even secessionist. The Guangdong government has defended themselves by saying that only products that have foreign-made components or raw materials have been taxed, and that they are merely defending Chinese industry from foreign economic imperialism. He has turned to many sentiments expressed by Chinese nationalists and leftists who have historically called for an aggressive crackdown on foreign trade flowing through Hong Kong and Macau, hoping to place pressure on foreign concessions to seek their return to Chinese rule.\n\nOthers however have noted that customs officers have disproportionately focused their efforts on driving out goods that resemble products made in Guangdong, and that soybeans produced from Manchuria have also been taxed, and have thus labelled Chen as an opportunist. Some have even indicated that Chen Jitang and his cronies extensively benefit from these policies, enriching their New Guangdong clique at the expense of the merchants."

Much government bureaucracy has been streamlined and slashed in the name of efficiency and the audit department has been restored.\n\nChen has quickly extended a hand of cooperation to the Guangdong Provincial Bank, an institution established by him to help the transition from Imperial Taels to Republican dollars back in 1910. In order to secure stability for banking notes, Chen Jiongming has once again signed an agreement with the Hong Kong Banking Corporation, though this has caused notable unrest in the population. Chen has also called upon Chen Xiru to help him secure foreign loans from a slew of powers and openly published the agreements, a first in Cantonese history. Kuomintang agitators greatly protested the move, denouncing Chen as an agent for foreign interests.\n\nIn times past, Chen could count on the financial reliability of the British Government for support, but with their fall, the Federalist Governor finds himself sorely lacking in foreign backers. Without reliable foreign aid, Chen has increasingly considered cutting military spending, though such a move would undoubtedly cause unrest in the army, whose ranks already house many unreliable actors. Irrespective of military spending, Chen has also reformed the salt administration to increase revenue, which he plans to use to repay his government's loans."

 GXC.earlygame.300.b: "Yeah, let's not offend our allies already..."

 GXC.earlygame.301.t: "Excising the King of Vices"
 GXC.earlygame.301.d: "One of the main hallmarks of Chen's first governorship was his total ban on gambling in 1920, met with cheers from the populace. Chen's administration was very strict on any attempt to set up a lottery, with the Governor forcing everyone to vote publicly and castigating everyone who supported it as being bought out. Later on in his first governorship, he formed the General Association for the Suppression of Gambling. The General Association established the death penalty for gamblers, closed brothels, and established heavy fines for opium. Although prohibition was never abolished even after Chen was forced out of Guangdong, it was really strictly enforced except when he was governor.\n\nWith Governor Chen back in charge and his financial reforms in full swing, he has wasted no time in restoring gambling prohibitions. Although Chen Lianbo has raised concerns to Governor Chen Jiongming regarding governmental revenue losses with the gambling ban, the latter defended the ban, explaining that the government's loss of revenue from gambling was meant to be balanced out with the salt tax reform, eliminating corrupt middlemen and cracking down on smuggling while promoting a free market to avoid prices from rising.\n\nIn order to promote a free market, Chen has divided salt producing districts into several monopolised \"selling districts\", designated Guangdong and provinces that import Guangdong salt as monopolised \"buying districts\" and within each buying district, designated a certain number of merchants who can trade freely at competitive prices. To him, this will allow buying and selling monopolies to freely do so against each other, reducing government run regulation. Although Chen Jiongming's reforms are far from universally acclaimed, few can say that his administrative reforms aren't a great improvement from the decade of anarchy."
 GXC.earlygame.301.a: "The Governor knows best!"

 GXC.earlygame.302.t: "China's Plunge into Modernity"
 GXC.earlygame.302.d: "One of China's most famous exports, silk, has recently been under increased scrutiny from the Governor. Hoping to promote the silk industry of Guangdong, Governor Chen has ordered all counties in Guangdong to establish a forestry management office, and reestablished the inspection office for raw silk and a Centre for the Production of Seed Silkworm. On top of silk, Chen has also looked to promote coffee, rubber, and tropical fruit farms. Recently, he had a canning factory opened in Guangzhou, and has seen to establishing Whampoa as a deep water port once again.\n\nChen even hopes to establish a major stock exchange in Guangzhou, inviting Chinese merchants from Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Guangzhou to participate in developing one. Formerly in disrepair in the decade of anarchy, Chen has restored the Industrial and Commercial Products Exposition. In order to police the growing commerce in Guangdong, he restored the authority of the Association of Chambers of Commerce of Guangdong, which he first set up in March 1922.\n\nOne of the dreams of the Governor is to establish a provincial railway system, and he has seen to the continual development of previously built highways from Huizhou and Zhangmutou and set up the East River District Highway Authority. In order to modernise the Canton-Hankou railway, he has sought out the Germans for another loan. On top of railroad modernisations, he has seen to the modernisation of Guangzhou itself. Many old walls have been torn down, and new business centres and public parks are being built in their wake. The Guangdong people will truly remember this as a period of prosperity."
 GXC.earlygame.302.a: "Guangdong is being rebuild one step at a time!"

 GXC.earlygame.303.t: "Ending the Age of Anarchy"
 GXC.earlygame.303.d: "To avoid the utter chaos of the decade of anarchy once again, refining the administration has been top priority for Chen Jiongming's government. His regime has already outlined several plans to streamline the provincial government, restructure the county governments, and implement a system for evaluating the performance of county magistrates.\n\nChen laid out similar plans during his first governorship, but now with Guangdong fully under his control, he may finally enact his full vision without Kuomintang or Guangxi reprisal. In order to stabilize the paper currency, improve tax collection, control expenditure, and achieve a balanced budget, Chen has continued his post Sun-split strategy of courting the gentry and elites, so that they may collaborate with Guangzhou on matters of finance.\n\nOf course, no stability can truly be achieved without enforcement or the support of the peasantry, and Chen has seen to it that the Department of Industry adopt a new economic policy to investigate ways to develop the mining industry, put idle land into cultivation, promote the industrial arts to provide employment, and cooperate with local farmers. On the matter of public security, Chen has seen to the immediate extension of the police force to every corner of the province and established police academies to train qualified personnel."
 GXC.earlygame.303.a: "May Guangdong remain ever stable!"

 GXC.earlygame.304.t: "Washington's Favoury"
 GXC.earlygame.304.d: "With Governor Chen's attempts to establish Guangzhou as a friendly port to all traders, many Americans have found themselves in the city, some for commercial opportunities, and others simply to escape from the chaos back home. Although Chen has not publicly declared his government to be inspired by the American Federal System, his administration has increasingly gained the reputation of being Americophilic, with many American journalists noting such. Conversely, his government is also regarded as being hostile to the Franco-British Syndicalist governments which funded his Kuomintang rivals.\n\nHis government is also noted as being increasingly hostile towards Tokyo despite the presence of pro-japanese figures such as Chen Lianbo in its higher echelons, no doubt a product of increasing Japanese influence in Dongbei and an increase of tensions across Asia. Although the United States has fallen into anarchy not too dissimilar to Guangdong's dark decade following the Northern Expedition, Chen has found American merchants and banks to remain fairly reliable and friendly, and many expect the US to find a friend in Guangzhou once the dust settles back home."
 GXC.earlygame.304.a: "We in China, like you, want a better world and we must have it!"

 GXC.earlygame.305.t: "Collective Bargaining"
 GXC.earlygame.305.d: "Chen Jiongming, though an idealist at heart, has always had a complicated relation to the labour movement. Although supportive of unionism, Governor Chen has opposed politicians using the labour movement for political capital, telling Chen Duxiu it should remain for the time being a \"labour education movement\" during the latter's time in Chen Jiongming's administration. With Chen attempting to once again strengthen the leftist flank in his political alliance structure, socialist inspired strikes by unions has Chen Jiongming opt for negotiation, calling for everyone to come together as one big family \"seeking compromise, mutual aid, and mutual understanding in order to achieve progress.\"\n\nChen's government is no stranger to dealing with strikes, with Huang Yanpei once describing the Guangdong government's approach as three pronged. Firstly, the Guangdong government has fostered labour unions but sternly cautioned them against using strikes to settle labour grievances. Secondly, it has tried to eliminate illiteracy amongst the labour force by establishing evening schools in factories. Thirdly, Chen's government has attempted to negotiate via direct relations with the leadership of the Machinery Workers Union, led by anarchists Li Dexuan and Zhu Jingli, who are willing to once again work with Chen's government after a decade of suppression by Chen Lianbo.\n\nWhen the Hong Kong Seamen's Union launched a major strike in 1922 which spread into Guangzhou, Chen established the Cereal Relief bureau to import rice from Huizhou and Guangxi to prevent profiteering. Afterwards, Chen was able to mediate the dispute between the strikers and the British. Ultimately, Chen's goal has been that unions should stay apolitical and focused on economics only, though such a sentiment is unlikely to be achieved in the short term."

 GXC.earlygame.306.t: "Kneecapping the Revolution's Engine"
 GXC.earlygame.306.d: "One of the major visionaries of a new Free China, Zhang Junmai has outlined his plan to develop the nation and save it from the social revolution of the Kuomintang. First, China's economy must not repeat the history of European Capitalism. Socialisation of enterprises has to begin with railroads and mines, and be administered by a joint organisation of government, technicians, and consumers.\n\nA mixed economy should be pursued, but China must be careful that it isn't one that isn't basically run by apparatchiks at the expense of the poor's ability to enjoy equality of human happiness, as \"the evils that arose would certainly be more numerous than private ownership and capitalism\" in his mind. Expropriation should also be carried out by purely legal means, not syndicalist expropriation, with compensation for nationalised properties and in an orderly way.\n\nOn the matter of money in politics, Zhang has pushed for banks and large industries to be heavily taxed and prevented from using their wealth to influence politics. For foreign banks, Zhang has pushed for them to be eliminated altogether, alongside all foreign economic influence in China. On the subject of land, Zhang believes newly developed commercial ports and lands should be municipalised and uncleared land should not be administered and developed by individuals.\n\nAlthough a supporter of land nationalisation in theory, Zhang has cautioned against just giving it to the peasants because it would merely change from large private property to small private property. Although a critic of workers councils in German factories on account of them failing to represent the workers, Zhang has nonetheless pushed for their gradual establishment in Chinese factories.\n\nRegardless, Zhang views them as a stepping stone and the start of a constitutional organisation of the factories. To many in Guangdong, Zhang's ideas have already seen many taken to them in earnest and the Governor himself finds himself considering them."
 GXC.earlygame.306.a: "A brilliant man with a daring plan to heal the nation!"
 GXC.earlygame.306.b: "He merely parrots the ideas of the German SPD!"

 GXC.earlygame.307.t: "Reform in the Paint of Revolution?"
 GXC.earlygame.307.d: "To many, Chen Jiongming represents an alternative on the left to the Kuomintang, without the radicalisation and vanguardism they have been prone to. However, many would instead regard Chen Jiongming's Federalist Movement as intrinsically conservative and reformist, and thus not a true alternative to the revolutionary Kuomintang. Chen's anarchist allies, who represent the leftist flank of his movement, have been noted for their gradualist attitudes, seriously putting into question the revolutionary aspect of the Federalists. For Chen himself, the anarchists that inspired him \"featured the Tolstoyan idea of rural self-rule and the Kropotkinian concept of mutual aid, projected a moderate, gradualist path towards social and political transformation.\"\n\nEven Marxists within the Federalist Movement such as Chen Duxiu, Li Dazhao, and Bai Jianwu were known to be partially inspired by Liang Qichao, who was the father of China's reformists. By Chen's second governorship, the likes of Chen and Li had already thrown in decisively with the Kuomintang, depriving the Federalists of its leftist credentials even more. Zhang Shizhao, a major liberal figure in Beijing, has been regarded as being all about \"compromise politics,\" while Zhang Taiyan supported federal self-governance, rejecting the nation-state and believed it to be a uniquely Chinese destiny.\n\nChen's other allies have not helped this image either. When the Zhili Clique defeated Fengtian in 1921, Chen and other Federalists extended a hand to the centralist Jade Marshal, hoping that his nationalist credentials would make him amenable to their ideas. Wu's protégé went further in adopting provincial self rule for his League of Eight Provinces in order to ingratiate himself with the local elite of Eastern China, thus bringing federalism into direct association with the Zhili, now considered the arch reactionaries of the nation. Chen has much work to do if he plans on forging a more revolutionary image for his movement."

 GXC.earlygame.307.b: "Nothing wrong with a reputation for reform..."

 GXC.earlygame.308.t: "Education by a Social Democrat"
 GXC.earlygame.308.d: "An educator at heart, Zhang Junmai has spent most of his career teaching. The National Institute of Political Science which he set up was founded in 1924 with the help of local Zhili governors and figures including Sun Chuanfang, and staffed its faculty with many foreign educated staff. Zhang's philosophy was to achieve a middle ground between emulation and rejection of Western education. While at the National Institute, Zhang declared that there were two ideas in political philosophy, being government by men and government by law. To him, China mastered the first while the West mastered the second. Zhang argued that China must seek a middle ground in the two for its new government system, as neither will work on its own for the reorganisation of China.\n\nFor the goals of the National Institute, he adopted the policies of cultivating the ability to organise in its student body and an objective study of Western political systems. To promote organisational skills, he looked to teach students self-governance by granting them a measured degree of autonomy. To teach western political thought, he established four departments of politics, economics, sociology, and international relations. To him, the National Institute's aim was not only the teaching of knowledge, but \"to produce good men and to formulate sound systems and programmes which will be the basis of the future reformation and reconstruction\" of China."

 GXC.earlygame.309.t: "Free Business in a Free China"
 GXC.earlygame.309.d: "Guangdong has long been a haven for businessmen and merchants, and Chen Jiongming's government has no shortage of business interests. General Weng Shiliang, whilst initially an officer in Chen's Guangdong Army, found a successful business career after semi-retirement from the military and politics. Presiding over the Huizhou Pingtan Sugar Factory, Weng has made his fortune and his interest in politics only dwindles as he ages.\n\nChen's old friend Zhou Xingnan's business exploits are also well known. During his time with Chen's army, Zhou found himself working on Fujian's infrastructure to help the military campaign. After returning to Guangdong in 1920, Zhou did much of the same in Huizhou as he did in Zhangzhou. When Chen's forces were repulsed from Guangdong, Zhou found himself in Xiamen again, and spent the next decade building roads and parks.\n\nAnother one of Chen's associates, Chen Xiru was heir to his father Chen \"Prince of Business\" Fang's sugar business. Chen donated heavily to the early revolutionary cause of the Tongmenghui, and fell in with Chen Jiongming later in life. In the early 20s, Chen became manager Douglas Steamship Company in Hong Kong and the director of the Sino-Japanese Bank in Hong Kong.\n\nYin Ji, a Hunanese born graduate of Guangzhou Military Academy, initially served with the Old Guangxi Clique before being forced out due to xenophobia and found himself in service to Hong Zhaolin instead. After leaving the military, Yin retired to his hometown in Guiyang and engaged in charity and public welfare.\n\nChen Lianbo, well known to all, was born into a wealthy business family and made his fortune from the silk industry and insurance. Rising above the other merchants in Guangzhou, Chen led the Merchant Corps in defence against the Kuomintang, and controlled Guangdong for a decade after. Even now having ceded power to Chen Jiongming, Chen Lianbo continues to be prominent in both business and politics."

 GXC.earlygame.310.t: "March of a Tempered Radical"
 GXC.earlygame.310.d: "While much of the socialist movement in China has been influenced by Russian-style bolshevism, Kropotkin's anarchism, and French syndicalism, Zhang Dongsun found himself drawn to English guild socialism. Initially drawn to mass democracy, Zhang promoted these ideas in the new republic. However, Yuan centralisation of power and dictatorial tendencies pushed Zhang to instead look for a backbone for the republic so that it could foster a strong modern state. Zhang became interested in state socialism derived from the Fabian society, which refuted capitalism based on the living conditions of the working class and advocated collectivism through state ownership and social legislation.\n\nWhat drew Zhang particularly to Fabianism was its political elitism, which would stay with him for the rest of his political career. The chaos of the early republic led him, Liang Qichao, and Zhang Junmai to believe in political reformation led by modern intellectuals like themselves. Zhang finally took the plunge into guild socialism when Bertrand Russell came to China in 1920 on the invitation of Liang and Zhang. Writing that the socialist state could slip into tyranny should it amass too much power, Russell criticised the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia as a dictatorship only of the Communist Party and not of the proletariat.\n\nAlso a critic of the Russian Revolution, Zhang Dongsun praised the moderate socialism which Russell preached, and applauded the balance between industrial unions and the state to ensure the greatest amount of freedoms to labourers and encourage their political participation whilst also putting necessary constraints on them. Russell ended up abandoning his hopes of achieving guild socialism in China, leading Zhang to regard him as not properly understanding China. Emancipated from following orthodox Western thought, Zhang began formulating his own theories on guild socialism to prove its feasibility in China."

 GXC.earlygame.311.t: "Zhang Dongsun's Theory of Socialism"
 GXC.earlygame.311.d: "While an early supporter of the CSP, Zhang left the group after realising it was to become a group dedicated to French syndicalism and became increasingly insurrectionist. Working with Liang, Zhang promoted a moderate view of socialism, following Marxist historical materialism but rejecting insurrectionism, as revolution as China currently was would lead to soldiers and bandits rising up in its name rather than labourers and unions. Thus, China had to first facilitate development and create a class of \"bourgeois gentlemen\" (shengsheng jieji), who would be the backbone of an industrialised modern nation. They would form an elite group and provide strong leadership to expel western imperialism.\n\nAs factories continue building, education becoming more accessible to the poor, and socialist propaganda being more widespread, the Chinese working class would be robust enough to balance out the power of the bourgeois gentlemen class and call for socialism. Guild socialists would then take root, with them promoting a balanced socialist democracy that would represent all of society. Industry would be operated by shop stewards and self-governing workers, while the state apparatus could remain in the hands of the elite. Recognising that as an agrarian state, the majority of the population were peasants and landlords, and defenders of the status quo. Zhang recognised that as China's population was mostly peasants and landlords who would defend the status quo and be a bulwark of conservatism, he instead looked to factory workers as his socialist pillar. Through socialist education, the urban masses could become the bedrock of a new socialist society."

 GXC.earlygame.312.d: "With Chen Jiongming's rise to power in Guangdong and Guangxi, Zhang Dongsun has a unique opportunity to put his theories into practice. Chen, while allied with many conservative gentry and reactionary generals, has always had an anarchist streak that was coated with gradualism not too dissimilar from Zhang's own interpretation of socialism. Guangzhou is also one of the few regions of China that has already embraced capitalism compared to the more feudal interior, and thus need not wait for as much capitalist development to take place.\n\nGuangzhou is also home to many industrial workers who will prove to be an attractive audience for Zhang Dongsun's theories. Though Chen has discouraged the politicisation of unions, Zhang Dongsun has pushed his friend and party leader Zhang Junmai to propagate their party platform to various labour leaders. Through Xuehai University and the Democratic Socialist Party, Zhang propagates his interpretations of socialism.\n\nWhile Zhang Junmai and Zhang Dongsun have differing views on socialism, they share a belief in political elitism carried from their shared mentor, Liang Qichao. Through educational institutions, they promote their ideas to the next generation of intellectuals. Regarding the Grand Republican League as the political elite who will lead the push out western imperialism, Zhang is confident that Guangdong will serve as the template for the inevitable coming of Chinese guild socialism."

 GXC.earlygame.313.d: "Zhang's time in the National Institute ended in 1932 when he was purged by Sun Chuanfang for his leftist sympathies following the Shanghai Uprising, and he went to Guangzhou, where he founded the Xuehai Institute alongside Zhang Dongsun, with acquiescence from Chen Lianbo. Chen wanted to train talent for his regime, and often butted heads with Zhang Dongsun, with the latter nearly leaving for Beijing, but was persuaded to stay by Zhang Junmai. In the Xuehai Institute, Zhang sought to revive China's national culture in education, lamenting that new age Chinese institutions had dropped its former emphasis on morality, which to him had its uses.\n\nThus, he promoted the idea of self-cultivation alongside absorbing the best from Western Knowledge. Zhang declared that \"our institute does not cling to the old nor does it chase after the new. It desires to simultaneously develop and enhance the strong points of China and the West in order to make up for the deficiencies of the present universities.\" With Chen Jiongming's recent elevation to the Governorship, Zhang has proposed developing a new Institute in Guangzhou, known as the Institute of National Culture which will be his magnum opus of education, to push forward his goals of morality and learning. Zhang does not wish for his new Institute to be government-run, but it will certainly be a boon for Chen's administration to have the learned youth flock to Guangzhou and seek a career in his halls."

 GXC.earlygame.314.t: "Socialism through the Handshake"
 GXC.earlygame.314.d: "To Zhang Dongsun, long-lasting Chinese guilds could be transformed into modern industrial unions through organisational and ideological reconstruction. To achieve this, Zhang recognised a need to go through the stage of capitalism so that numerous jobs could be created and worker welfare improved to a limited extent, and provide institutional channels for them to consult the capitalist classes. Meanwhile, education would be funded by the wealthy, which would improve workers' literacy and turn the working class into an enthusiastic audience for the ideas of socialism. While the bourgeoisie would provide the economic stepping stones into socialism, the intellectuals would bring salvation to the uninformed masses of the nation. To more radical marxists in the Kuomintang and CSP, Zhang's ideas to wait for capitalist development and put off class struggle is merely a wait-and-see theory, which China cannot afford to wait for. Zhang could be characterised as not particularly trustworthy of the people, though he himself would refer to it as his interpretation of Marxist scientific socialism."

 GXC.earlygame.400.d: "In the end, the Kuomintang advance was unstoppable. Despite defeat after defeat, failure after failure, the Kuomintang and its loyalists never gave up. Like Sun Yat-sen before them, the nationalists found a way to return to power in Guangzhou, toppling rival warlords and once more challenging the authority of Beiyang. Thanks to the courageous efforts of General Chen Mingshu and his Tenth Division, marching south from MinGan with the support of leftist elements in the countryside and in the cities, and General Chen Jitang who secured the timely defection of the Guangdong army to the Kuomintang cause, Guangdong has been freed from reactionary oppression. Meanwhile, storming in from their bases in Guizhou, the remnant of the \"Seventh Army\" the National Revolutionary Army has re-established their control over Guangxi, installing the \"New Guangxi clique\" under Li Zongren into power.\n\nA provisional revolutionary junta has been established with the three victorious generals representing their respective factions. Calling themselves the South China Political Council, broad ideological and personal divisions remain between the revolutionary generals which are expected to worsen as their supports consolidate political control over their respective regions. It remains to be seen if they will truly be able to live up to their founder's legacy, or if like him their zeal will ultimately fall short of unifying China."

 GXC.earlygame.401.d: "Despite repeated failures over the last few decades and the death of their founder, the Kuomintang refuse to yield in their quest to realise Sun Yat-sen's vision. Nowhere was that more apparent, it seems, than their traditional homebase in Liangguang, which fell to invading revolutionary forces from MinGan and Guizhou as well as uprisings by cells from within.\n\nThis has brought to power a revolutionary junta led by the victorious generals: the leftist Chen Mingshu and rightist Chen Jitang both of Guangdong as well as General Li Zongren of Guangxi. How long this so-called South China Political Council can remain internally cohesive, much less bring their revolution to the rest of China remains to be seen."
 GXC.earlygame.401.a: "Our comrades prove their tenacity."

 GXC.earlygame.402.t: "Tensions in Guangdong"
 GXC.earlygame.402.d: "Guangdong was long the Kuomintang base of operations, and its recapture a milestone in reversing their failure to hold off German intervention during the Northern Expedition. Sharing the prize however, has not been easy. Even in the best of times, the Kuomintang's leaders seldom got along. Now, with their mutual enemies dead or on the run, the party has quickly returned to infighting.\n\nGuangzhou, the provincial capital, has been secured by the New Guangdong clique under Chen Jitang. He has leveraged it to secure himself as the nominal head of the three-man revolutionary junta. Chen Jitang was a relatively low ranking officer in the old Fourth Army who managed to survive in the post-1927 provincial government. Loosely affiliated with the right, his ambitions are said to be mostly regional in scope.\n\nHis challenger is Chen Mingshu, a fellow veteran of the Fourth Army sent south by the MinGan government. Setting up base in Shaoguan to the northeast, Chen has allied with peasant activists and syndicalist sympathisers. His willingness to join the junta has drawn some scorn from orthodox leftists but is nevertheless their best bet for taking power in Guangdong.\n\nFurther south, the New Guangxi clique has proven even more ambitious than previously thought. Their forces have advanced into Beihai, a port city in southwest Guangdong. Beihai is too small to meaningfully steer trade away from the Pearl River for the landlocked Guangxi, so the real objective seems to be the resource-rich island of Qiongya.\n\nChen Jitang has begged Li to leave the region to his forces' control - claiming their mutual best interest in containing socialism in the two provinces. He claims to fondly recall their past partnership in securing Guangxi, though is vague on any details for a future pact. Li, freshly arrived in Guangzhou to take part in proceedings, is well aware of the power in his hands, though is reluctant to give up such a powerful bargaining chip for free..."

 GXC.earlygame.402.b: "General Li elects to wait and see before making his next move."

 GXC.earlygame.403.t: "Rise of the New Guangxi Clique"
 GXC.earlygame.403.d: "The New Guangxi Clique was formed as the Old Guangxi Clique began to disintegrate following the devastating 1920s Yue-Gui Wars. Victory over Lu Rongting gave them control over the province and they played an integral role during the Northern Expedition as the Seventh Army of the NRA. With their triumphant return, most Guangxi clans since have sworn fealty.\n\nThe New Guangxi Clique is not the same as the one that went north to Wuhan. Once a regional force with little ideology of its own, the subsequent exile has firmly reoriented their identity. Li Zongren's newfound ambitions for national leadership is on full display now with his flashy presence in Guangzhou for junta meetings.\n\nThe clique internally is ruled as a triumvirate. Li's close friend General Bai Chongxi (together they are often called \"Li Bai\" after the famous Tang dynasty poet) shares his proclivity to act on the national stage, often serving in military roles and acting as a mediator. General Huang Shaohong, the third leg of the triumvirate and the newly named Governor of Guangxi, traditionally remained in Guangxi to manage provincial affairs while his allies were absent.\n\nThis second iteration of the clique puts the citizen-militia at the centre-stage, influencing nearly all their sweeping policies. General Huang Xuchu, a rising star, has taken the lead in streamlining government and military organs into one \"Combined Government Office\" that holds jurisdiction over all matters of economy, reconstruction, and education.\n\nThis centralisation of party, military, and government power perhaps is a natural fit for the Kuomintang's ideal of party rule, though some worry that in Guangxi party is being subsumed by the needs of the warlords. That, however, is not to say the army always has priority: Li often touts his success in bringing the army strictly under civilian authority. Whatever the truth is, Huang's rise has led to some speculation that the triumvirate will soon become a quadrumvirate."

 GXC.earlygame.403.b: "The two Huangs compete for influence, dividing the clique."

 GXC.earlygame.404.t: "Socialists in Guangzhou"
 GXC.earlygame.404.d: "Guangzhou has long been a hotbed for leftist activity. With the Guangdong Army severely weakened by recent upheaval and many units having been deployed outside the city to face down Chen Mingshu's men and attempt to secure Qiongya, some believe that Guangzhou itself is vulnerable to further infiltration. The local chapter of the Chinese Syndicalist Party, led by famed labour organiser Deng Zhongxia, union activist and senior party leader Su Zhaozheng, and radical insurgent leader Zhang Tailei, have come out of hiding. They have found their ranks swelling, easily recruiting industrial workers, sailors, and other labourers to their cause.\n\nTheir actions, unsubtle as always, has quickly caught the attention of Chen Jitang. Suspicious of their intentions and already wary of the growing leftist threat to his control of Guangdong, he has lashed out in party meetings against the Chinese Syndicalist Party. He denounced them as foreign agents, loyal primarily to Paris and London, and accused them of sabotaging the Kuomintang revolution through actions such as the subversive formation of the League of Chinese Syndicalists, the violent Canton-Hong Kong Strike (which sank Kuomintang relations with foreign powers), and other actions that he claims have leeched the strength of Dr. Sun's movement in favour of the global socialist agenda.\n\nHis desire to clamp down socialist agitation has met with some opposition, even within his camp. Not all members of the Guangdong army are necessarily right-leaning, and there has been some questions about the loyalty of his officers. However, with the power vacuum growing in Guangzhou as Kuomintang forces clear out their former opposition, violence has broken out as syndicalist-aligned militias attack former members of the Merchant Corps and the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce. Hated by many for their submission to foreign powers, it has nevertheless attracted concerns by conservative elements that Guangzhou is hurtling towards anarchy."

 GXC.earlygame.405.d: "In a distant land, a group of Chinese elder statesmen languish in exile. This rightist Central Committee lies dormant, held together by the sheer power of Hu Hanmin's will. One of Sun Yat-sen's closest confidants, he succeeded Sun as Generalissimo. However, after the secretive Shantou meetings by Wang Jingwei, Chiang Kai-shek, Liao Zhongkai, and others, Hu was quickly forced to step down in favour of a \"National Government Council\" that replaced the Generalissimo's office. Wang became Chairman and Hu demoted to Foreign Minister (of an unrecognised government).\n\nHu, despite his support for the reorganisation, was recognised as the leader of the right, and many called for him to stand against the \"Syndicalist Issue\". Plans for a showdown at the Fourth Plenum saw a drastic turn when Liao Zhongkai was shot by an officer affiliated with Hu's brother. Hu escaped direct blame, but the Plenum soon devolved into a bitter party split.\n\nChiang Kai-shek and his centrist military faction came out in support of the United Front and Hu was exiled to Paris \"to learn more about the merits of syndicalism\". Meanwhile, with the British Revolution victorious and no resolution to the stand-off in sight, many rightists fled to the Western Hills suburbs of Beijing hoping to secure Guominjun support. Those members, including eight central committee members, quickly radicalised and were expelled from the party. Hu, long reluctant to buck party orthodoxy, saw the writing on the wall and defected to Moscow.\n\nFeng Yuxiang was later pushed out of Beijing, and many of this \"Western Hills Conference\" joined Hu in Russia, playing little role in the Northern Expedition. Chen Jitang has breathed new hope for them, opening negotiations to secure their return to Guangzhou. But Hu Hanmin, ever proud, has no intentions of sundering Sun's legacy by becoming a puppet for a petty warlord. He has made a sticking point over talks about government posts, constitutional rule, and other demands."

 ##KMT Early Game Political Tree Events (430-459)
 GXC.earlygame.430.t: "Setting the Party Line"
 GXC.earlygame.430.d: "Sun Yat-sen once bemoaned in a 1923 party meeting at Guangdong that \"there was a spurious saying at the time of China's retrocession [from Manchu to Han rule] that 'the revolutionary party was to be disbanded at the very moment the revolutionary army successfully rose up'. This idea was attributable to a certain bureaucrat who enthusiastically supported the revolution and echoed by party members like Huang Xing, Song Jiaoren and Zhang Taiyan. At that time, it was taken as a truism. After the Tongmenghui was reorganised into the Kuomintang, the party was thoroughly transformed into a political party and depleted of revolutionary spirit.\"\n\nTo Dr. Sun, the failure of the first revolution was because of the party's decision to lay down their arms and compromise with the Beiyang army, not realising that the old establishment had to be thoroughly dismantled first. Those who sought to compromise with the warlords were doomed; either killed or rendered irrelevant. On the other hand, party-rule could not simply be a matter of taking over the state, acting as a new class of bureaucrats. The party must take on a \"prophetic\" role, converting the people to the truth of the Three Principles like a revolutionary gospel.\n\nBut with the party's Eternal Premier long gone, his flock have lost their way. The newly re-established Propaganda Department has been reformed in hopes of spreading the revolutionary good news to the people. But the exact message we should be sending lays muddled in the Kuomintang's multi-layered identity. The party had its roots as a broad-tent liberal democratic party in the early 1900s up until the 1910s. It moved towards a more leftist, vanguardist direction following the 1924 reorganisation, promising thorough revolution and discipline. Perhaps uniting the party through all its iterations is its unwavering Chinese nationalism, calling upon its faithful to save the fractured land and fight off foreign imperialism."
 GXC.earlygame.430.a: "We call for a return to our more idealistic, democratic roots from a better time."
 GXC.earlygame.430.b: "We promise a revolution to heal China's wounds at its very foundations."
 GXC.earlygame.430.c: "We swear to save the nation from all enemies at home and abroad - by any means necessary!"

 GXC.earlygame.431.t: "The Intelligentsia of Guangdong"
 GXC.earlygame.431.d: "In an effort to present a more democratic face, contrast themselves to the iron-fisted rule of Beiyang, and to tame the Republican hotbed that was 1920s Guangzhou, previous Cantonese warlords preserved a certain degree of political freedom in the city. While not nearly as vibrant as it once was, plenty of republicans disillusioned with the cynical reactionaryism have settled down in Guangzhou or Hong Kong. The latter has been particularly attractive to democratic exiles fleeing the law.\n\nThe Grand Republican Alliance, which sought to rally many of these figures, has since collapsed. Its component organisations, including the Old Guangdong Army affiliated Public Interest Party of Chen Jiongming and the big-tent Chinese Democratic League of Zhang Junmai, have scattered in wake of Kuomintang advances.\n\nWhile the flight of their senior leadership was perhaps inevitable, the lower republicans that remain in Guangzhou grow uneasy. While we share a dream of a republic far different from Beiyang's decadence, many are wary of Kuomintang authoritarianism and dread the repression of our secret police. Federalists affiliated with Chen Jiongming remember the bitter fights between Chen and Dr. Sun, and plenty plan to join Chen's flight to the legations. Wealthier intellectuals, many affiliated with the League, resent the heavy war-time taxation the party imposes, claiming us to be even more extortionate and undemocratic than the warlords.\n\nThat is not to say it is too late to win them back. More moderate factions in the Kuomintang, namely the Reconstruction Faction and the Western Hills Clique are less inclined towards long-term vanguardism. Moderate leftists like Chen Mingshu have expressed an openness to dialogue with more honest republicans, hoping to convert their idealism to action. Still, as Dr. Sun once warned, \"to know is difficult, to do is easy\". Some of these men would rather stubbornly debate while the nation burns, in the end it is up to us to save the nation."

 GXC.earlygame.432.d.rkmt: "The Kuomintang have long had an uneasy relationship with local elites, who fear the Kuomintang's promised far-reaching reforms and the revolutionary, authoritarian turn of the party. The gentry in particular feel threatened by the party's alliances with various peasant groups and their long-awaited vows of extensive land reform. This has bedevilled both right and left wings of the party, who often find themselves at odds with the gentry even as occasional alliances are struck and broken.\n\nThe latest incarnation of Kuomintang rule in Liangguang has made another push to assert power over the agrarian elites, this time taking aim at their various militias. Formed in part to maintain social order in face of growing unrest, the \"Security Corps\" organised through the Guangdong Grain Industry Maintenance Association has acted as an arm of landed interests.\n\nGovernor Chen Jitang has sought to strip the local gentry of their ability to resist his rule, forcibly dissolving some of these \"security teams\" while integrating others. He has ordered new training courses to be offered at the Military Political Academy for producing \"loyal\" security guards, part of his effort to create a comprehensive provincial gendarmerie aligned to the party (and more importantly himself).\n\nAfter a long campaign, it seems the GIMA is ready to yield, a delegation including their Chairman Qiu Jingyun, his deputy Wang Zuoxin, and the commander of the security corps Lin Douwen has come to the Governor's Mansion to negotiate a disarmament plan. Their \"surrender\" is hardly unconditional however, they expect us to \"protect their right to life and property\" and expect some say in the eventual implementation of land reform, a precedent that will likely have far reaching effects down the line. Still, making peace with the gentry is not the worst idea either, they provide for a useful counterbalance to socialist elements and once pacified will free up troops for the front."

They have gone even further than the magistrates sent to carry out land redistribution policies, earning both admiration and hatred.\n\nAfter a long campaign, it seems the GIMA is on the verge of collapse. Still, the violence has shown little signs of ceasing and many are calling for restraint by the new government. Reports of attacks on smaller and medium sized landowners aligned with the Kuomintang have caused major rifts in party control of the countryside, and more moderate leftist militias are said to be organising in response. Still, more radical elements call for the campaign to not cease until the gentry's power is completely and irrevocably broken, lest they recover and cause further trouble down the line."

 GXC.earlygame.433.d: "Although our ties to Sun Fo and his \"Hawaii Clique\" have often been strained, many of them have long standing ties with Guangdong and a vested interest in the Kuomintang's well-being in the province. Our efforts to court them, and more importantly their vast connections across Chinese diaspora communities in Southeast Asia, has born some fruit as of late.\n\nAn associate of Sun Fo has arrived to meet with [ROOT.GetLeader] and other Cantonese officials. Morris Abraham Cohen was a lifelong adventurer. A former bodyguard of Sun Yat-sen, he was born to an Orthodox Jewish family in Poland before immigrating to England. A child pickpocket, he was sent to Canada to (unsuccessfully) reform his ways where he grew friendly with Chinese immigrants working at the Canadian Pacific Railways. One of the few white men willing to associate with Chinese labourers, he was allowed to join the Tongmenghui after defending a Chinese restaurateur from being robbed.\n\nAfter a stint helping Chinese immigrants become naturalised, he fought in the Great War. The end of the conflict saw him without a job in an economic downturn, so he went to China to help close a railway deal for Sun Yat-sen. The men became close, facilitated by many of Sun's circle's familiarity with English. An aide-de-camp and an acting colonel in Sun Yat-sen's army, he helped train revolutionary soldiers.\n\nHe became an object of fascination after being nicked with a bullet during combat, leading him to carry a second revolver out of fear that he may lose an arm in the future. Ambidextrous, this gave rise to his nickname \"Two-Gun Cohen\". He has sought work with our armies, offering his services as a mercenary trainer. Though his Chinese is poor, he has a demonstrated history with the party and ties including prominent Sun extended family members including Sun Fo, Song Ziwen and Song Qingling. Still, he's getting older and the party has plenty of experienced soldiers. Few would blame us if we turned him away."

 GXC.earlygame.434.t: "Compulsory Adult Education in Guangxi"
 GXC.earlygame.434.d: "\"Viewed from no matter what the angle, the Guangxi militia and adult education are inextricably united.\" This astute observation, reinforced by Bai Chongxi's recent statement that \"militia and education has been united into one\" by the New Guangxi clique, highlights just how fundamentally tied the New Guangxi Clique's implementation of political tutelage is with their dreams of a society inextricably linked to its citizen-militia.\n\nWhile the broader Kuomintang has always promoted education as one of their core social policies, and eradicating illiteracy long a goal of nationalists, intellectuals, and reformists alike, the New Guangxi clique has taken it a step further in their efforts to reshape their home province. At night, the village or ward's primary school is to become its centre of adult education. Teachers have been pulled from school faculty, village elders, university students on vacation, and even exemplary primary school pupils (dubbed \"the little teacher system\").\n\nThe goals of these programs are four-fold: first the end of adult illiteracy, second the promotion of patriotism and militia training. Moreover, in accordance with KMT political ideals, the New Guangxi Clique aims to strengthen popular interest in local self-government. Adult education has now become compulsory, with all primary schools required to enrol half of adults legally required to attend this year, and full attendance expected by the next.\n\nThe rollout has not been entirely smooth of course - primary school teachers receive no extra compensation for teaching night classes and although textbooks are to be paid for free of charge money is always tight. Indeed, compromises have already been made. Semesters originally were fixed at six months, but now many have shortened them to five to accommodate schedules. There is also a proposal to permit adult students to drop out of one programme and continue in a later one as the need arises. Still, the pace of change feels unceasing."

 ##KMT Leftist Coup Events
 GXC.earlygame.460.t: "The Clash for Canton Begins"
 GXC.earlygame.460.d: "Chen Mingshu was sent southwards at the start of the MinGan uprising in faint hope that by stirring up peasants and workers, he would be able to create a distraction that would prevent the warlords of Liangguang from striking us from the rear while we were vulnerable. He has succeeded beyond all expectations, overrunning what we thought to be well prepared defences in northern Guangdong and establishing contacts throughout the province.\n\nBut victory has its dangers. The Kuomintang's old heartland was in Guangdong, and with Chen Mingshu's forces on the march many old leftist cells have reactivated. This has created discord between Chen and various other allegedly \"Kuomintang\" generals who have carved out their own domains across the two Guangs. Many of these are rightist by nature, suspicious of our central committee and seeking self-gain over the revolution.\n\nOne of these men, a General Chen Jitang, has emerged in southern Guangdong sitting in Sun Yat-sen's old base of Guangzhou (Canton). Having secured the loyalty of the old Guangdong Army, we have received disturbing reports that he is in contact with our old rival Hu Hanmin, whose Moscow committee was long dismissed as a withered husk in exile. Should he be allowed to return to China however, he may very well corrupt many of the flagging civilian right in our party to his treacherous cause.\n\nAdding to the danger, there have always been doubts about Chen Mingshu's personal loyalty. He and his Tenth Division are known to be heterodox in their beliefs, decidedly leftist but often bucking with the PAC and RCA. Many other leftist factions in Guangdong have grown suspicious and embittered with the party mainstream. But nevertheless, Liangguang is a valuable prize. One that we can ill afford to lose and so close to our grasp."

 GXC.earlygame.461.d.YUN: "Despite our best efforts, Guangzhou has fallen to the forces aligned with the so-called \"Right Wing of the Kuomintang\", defiling Dr. Sun's legacy in the process. A rogue command of the National Revolutionary Army had fled to Guizhou after the collapse of the Northern Expedition, surviving on corruption and petty thuggery while abusing the Kuomintang's good name. They have become little more than petty warlords, however despite this they were able to overrun existing forces in Liangguang somehow.\n\nThe wounds of 1925 have been reopened. Though Chiang Kai-shek of the military centre is dead, his allies in He Yingqin and Dai Jitao have managed to rebulid his \"New Right\" coalition to outflank the \"Old Right\" under Hu Hanmin. With the boorish military chest-thumping of General He and the twisted, reactionary lies of Dai Jitao, they have managed to leverage control over the city to reinforce their pretentions of forming a new government to contend for national leaderhsip.\n\nAlready, the ramifications can be felt in [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], with many supposedly in our camp beginning to defect to Guangzhou. War between the party's leftist and rightist committees loom. Some like Sun Fo have made vain pleas to reconcile the two wings. Others, like the duplicitous Chen Mingshu remain on the fence, waiting to see which side is stronger. But unless something gives soon, a final showdown for the legacy of Dr. Sun is coming."
 GXC.earlygame.461.d.GXC: "Despite our best efforts, Chen Mingshu and his men were unable to oust Chen Jitang before he could make his grand move. Outflanking both the Guangdong left and with the tacit compliance of Guangxi warlords, Chen Jitang successfully brokered an agreement with Hu Hanmin. The false chairman has returned to Canton, defiling Dr. Sun's legacy. Returning with his is a posse of senile party elders, shameless bootlickers, and Russian mercenaries, the legacy of the party's \"Old Right\". The wounds of 1925 have reopened. With Chiang Kai-shek of the military centre dead, it seems that the surviving two triumvirs have returned to divide the party once more between them.\n\nWith a forked tongue and fiery words, Hu Hanmin spreads his deceit across the land.

Their opposition, arrayed in seemly impervious defence lines, evaporated almost overnight - weeks of skirmishes, insurgency, and defections sapped their strength.\n\nChen Mingshu's men, for their part seemed to know the route well. Well-placed spies and diligent scouting foiled most traps and ambushes along the route, preventing them from getting bogged down. As the Guangdong army's retreat turned into a rout, many of their units clogged the roads and were eradicated by the swiftly advancing Fourth Army. Guangzhou itself fell without a siege, a large general strike turned into urban rioting that allowed Chen Mingshu's men to storm the city with little fight.\n\nChen Jitang and his remaining loyalists, recoiling in utter shock and disbelief, have fled southwards to Qiongya. With similar uprisings breaking out on the island, the situation in Guangdong seems untenable for the right.

Resistance by Chen Jitang's Guangdong Army was ineffectual, with Guangzhou falling after a large general strike allowed for the Fourth Army to storm the city.\n\nBut that's where the successes ended. Chen Mingshu pinned his hopes on forcing Li Zongren and the New Guangxi clique to accept the leftist takeover as a fait accompli, standing by silently as he seizes Guangdong before forcing his submission. But the stubborn warlord refused to yield, intervening with his forces in a ferocious attempt to beat back Chen Mingshu's advance. Chen Jitang and his band of remaining loyalists fled southwards, rallying south of the Pearl River in Taishan.\n\nWith rightist resistance far higher than expected and Chen Mingshu's promised swift campaign stalling, the Fourth Army has begun to waver. It is clear they have misread the political climate and overstretched their lines, and we will need to intervene directly if we are to save them.\n\nAlready a round of finger-pointing has begun, with Chen Mingshu furiously blaming his superiors in [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] for giving him premature orders to advance. [CHI.GetLeader] and his officers in turn blame Chen for giving overly optimistic reports about the situation in Guangdong, painting him as an unreliable glory-hound.\n\nWhatever the case, the confused mess of orders from Nanjing to Shaoguan must stop and the MAC take direct control of the Fourth Army. Momentum might still be on our side, but the men of Guangxi are known to be fierce fighters and we face the frightening prospect of being bogged down in the hills of Guangxi.

Chen Jitang and his men, overconfident in their prepared defences, grew complacent as peasant militias began to overrun rural villages and hamlets. Infiltrators within their army created a steady stream of defections and a network of spies while skirmishes probed their lines for weak points and wore down morale. By the time the Fourth Army vanguard reached Guangdong lines, their foes were already a paper tiger.\n\nGuangzhou itself showed its true colours when a coordinated general strike paralysed city defences, avoiding a prolonged siege. A flotilla of gunboats led by Admiral Chen Ce reinforced the port as Chen Mingshu's men linked up with his allied fifth column. The \"Canton Coup\", as it has been dubbed in the press, sealed the fate of Guangdong in our favour.

Increasingly disillusioned with China's social order, many have fallen under the influence of charismatic speakers who rail against the landlords and warlords. Their most recent target for abuse has been none other than Chen Jitang and his cooperatives initiatives, who they claim represent the worst of Kuomintang rightist hypocrisy and empty promises.\n\nLed by Peng Pai, the Guangdong Provincial Farmers' Association have rallie abused peasants. They travel around the province, slinking away from Guangdong Army security forces and gentry backed militia, playing music and songs via gramophone to sway the people against perceived injustice.\n\nHis efforts to foment unrest, usually relatively contained despite his grandiose promises, have taken a much more belligerent, emphatic tone as of late. No doubt he has reconnected with the Kuomintang committee in [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], and is utilising their resources to his fullest advantage. His efforts have inflamed the rural insurgency. Rural guerillas bands have begun striking isolated security units and infiltrating guard posts. The gentry have reported kidnappings and assassinations among their ranks, and in some cases entire villages have been seized and title deeds burned.\n\nThis fighting, often far behind the front lines of the Fourth Army-Guangdong Army stand off, represents another dimension of the Clash for Canton. In many areas, local police forces are unable to contain the rebels and faith is declining in Chen Jitang's ability to govern. But diverting his limited forces is no easy task either. Many officers have chosen to hide in fortified villages and camps rather than confront the revolutionaries, leaving the vast countryside to the rebels.

When the Kuomintang fell because of the syndicalists' premature provocations against foreign powers, the CSP was wiped out along with them.\n\nAnd yet, like the Kuomintang it seems they have survived the last decade, much to Chen Jitang's chagrin. Having smuggled in various agitators, no doubt with the help and at the direction of [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], various workers and walked out of their jobs in Cantonese factories and dockyards. They have called for greater pay, worker control of industry, and unification with the leftist Kuomintang Central Committee.\n\nWhile certainly working in favour of Chen Mingshu's interests, the strike was instigated and continue to be led primarily by CSP officers including longtime activists Deng Zhongxia, Zhang Tailei, and Su Zhaozheng. They have been reinforced by agents of the Provisional Action Committee (PAC) faction, perhaps most notably one Ye Jianying. The arrival of MinGan officers in the city is of particular concern. Armed worker militias have been reported as threatening police, strikebreakers, and scabs even if the strikers are not yet bold enough to directly challenge the army.\n\nWith production stalled, profits declining, and instability rocking the city, Chen Jitang has been called by his allies to take action before the strike grows.

Liang Hancao is younger, a protégé of Sun Fo and rising star among Kuomintang liberals.

 GXC.earlygame.468.d: "Ever since the apparent Kuomintang victory in Liangguang, two Cantonese armies have faced off against each other in northern Guangdong. Digging trenches and building hastily constructed bunkers, the armies of the two General Chens have tried to consolidate their positions while destabilising their rivals. These efforts have been foiled by the realities of the situation: neither army has the numbers to cover the entirety of the province nor the discipline to prevent soldiers from coming and going as they please. The fact that both are ostensibly supposed to be allies under a shared provisional junta further complicates things, but hardly prevents patrols from getting into deadly clashes.\n\nThe balance of power in the region has see-sawed, with little end in sight. Hoping to swing things in their favour, [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has authorised the deployment of another legion to reinforce the Chen Mingshu and his Fourth Army. They have largely eschewed secrecy in this move, preferring to make their propagandised presence known as concerns of a futile, prolonged stalemate have been dampening morale on both sides.\n\nThe Fourth Army boast this latest detachment include many veterans from the successful MinGan insurgency, though more experienced commanders note that while these men might have been successful guerillas (if the claims are true), that has not always translated well in pitched, conventional battles. Commanders from the Guangdong Army have advised Chen Jitang to undercut the Fourth Army's narrative of imminent victory by launching a series of probing attacks along the frontline, showing the tide is unlikely to turn in the near future. But whether or not we have the reserves for such an operation remains in doubt."

 GXC.earlygame.600.t: "The Federalists Seize Liangguang"
 GXC.earlygame.600.d: "Despite many doubts, the Federalist demise proved to be exaggerated. Chen Jiongming rallied the Guangzhou government's disparate warlord forces, despite the lukewarm support of the city establishment, and overcame Guangxi's warlords and Kuomintang insurgents to restore order to not only his native Guangdong but also Guangxi. For his efforts, he has been rewarded with mastery over the two provinces and a chance to realise his old dream of a Federalist China.\n\nHis supporters in Guangdong are ecstatic, even if there are questions about what will happen next. Chen is able to draw support from a broad base that includes his Yue Army loyalists, the gentry and merchant elite, the Guangdong Provincial Assembly, various warlords, and liberal intellectuals. His election to the Governorship, though under dubious circumstances, is now assured as the assembly reconvenes and is expected to extend his term indefinitely.\n\nFor Guangxi, the mood is much darker. The Guangdong Army effectively won the war by seizing Nanning and allowing allied warlord bands (many of which were recent defectors) to take other cities as the Old Guangxi Clique collapsed. While all now kowtow to Guangzhou, the prevailing expectation is that Chen will not be able to maintain his hold over Guangxi for long. The sacking of major Guangxi cities by vengeful Guangdong troops and their allies has cast a cloud on their victory.\n\nAs Chen works to gather support for a new rival government in southern China, he is expected to confront a dilemma - the same Federalism that won him so much support will prove to be an obstacle for leaving Liangguang for elsewhere."
 GXC.earlygame.600.a: "All Forward under the Lawyer General!"

 GXC.earlygame.601.t: "Federalist Revival in Liangguang"
 GXC.earlygame.601.d: "Reduced to a minor Cantonese politician in the 1920s, Chen Jiongming of Guangdong has made a political comeback in the aftermath of the Liangguang civil war. Rallying the flagging Guangzhou city government and outlying Guangdong warlord forces, General Chen once again routed Old Guangxi troops in a campaign reminiscent his performance in the Yue-Gui Wars.\n\nAs the new master of the twin provinces, Chen Jiongming has been offered a second chance at implementing his Federalist ideals. Assembling a coalition that includes his loyalists in the Yue Army and Public Interest Party, the Cantonese gentry and merchants, various warlords, and liberal intellectuals, Chen seeks to build an alternative to the Beiyang order and Kuomintang radicalism."
 GXC.earlygame.601.a: "Proof federalism is hardly dead."
 GXC.earlygame.601.b: "The first time was folly, this second time is treachery."

 GXC.earlygame.602.t: "The History of Chinese Federalism"
 GXC.earlygame.602.d: "Federalism in China was tied to late Qing Dynasty political decentralisation. The Xinhai Revolution saw the emergence of the rival Beiyang and Guangzhou Governments. Neither were able to break the deadlock and both began to lose their grip on their allied provinces. Fears of being dragged into the violent civil war caused regionalism and distrust of central authority that manifested in a desire for provincial autonomy.\n\nThis also had feudal roots. Ming and Qing dynasty scholars have argued that the concept of protecting local autonomy to check tyrannical central power could be traced as early as the ancient Zhou Dynasty, using it to justify protections for their own intellectual autonomy from imperial control. This concept reemerged during Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao's Hundred Day Reforms which included local self-strengthening programs and the formation of 21 Provincial Assemblies in 1909.\n\nBy the 1910s, the concept of the Warlord (Junfa) emerged, perhaps derived from the Japanese word Gunbatsu - the marxist interpretation of Japanese military cliques. An almost intrinsically derogatory term, especially amid intellectual calls to separate military and civilian power, despite this there was extensive dialogue between the intellectuals, warlords, and politicians, blurring the lines. These new intellectuals embraced the traditional Confucian literati role of teaching and advising political leaders, but also engaged with the masses, labour relations, and public education, making them indispensable to local militarists.\n\nFederalism then, could be seen as a product of this dialogue. Proponents claimed it was an attempt to peacefully reunite the provinces stuck in a military quagmire. Opponents denounced it as an attempt by southern warlords to legitimise their power and divide the nation. The first wave of Federalism fizzled out in the 1920s. But with the nation once again divided, it seems that China is seeing a rebirth of Federalism."
 GXC.earlygame.602.a: "An idealistic project for national unity and democracy."
 GXC.earlygame.602.b: "A practical ideology for a divided, warring nation."

 GXC.earlygame.603.t: "The Occupation of Guangxi"
 GXC.earlygame.603.d: "The end of the Liangguang civil war was a complete reversal of fortunes between Guangdong and Guangxi, the latest of a series of conflicts between the twin provinces. Months later, Guangxi remains devastated and under Guangdong occupation while Guangxi leaders negotiate a return to the self-government they were promised. In August 1921, Guangdong forces occupied Nanning, ending the Second Yue-Gui War after a stunning counterattack. Chen Jiongming issued a four-point proclamation to minimise reprisals against the Guangxi population.\n\n1. The war is directed against the Guangxi militarists, not against the people of Guangxi. Enemy troops are welcome to join our forces.\n2. We are helping the Guangxi people to establish democratic rule and therefore should treat them as brothers.\n3. Every plant and every tree in Guangxi belongs to the people of Guangxi and should not be touched. Fair prices should be strictly asked and paid in buying or selling goods and foodstuff.\n4. Our past successes depended on the help given us by the local populace. We will be welcomed by the Guangxi people if we act in the normal civilised way.\n\nDespite this, there was considerable looting and brutality during the occupation as Guangdong soldiers took their revenge. Sun Yat-sen appointed educator Ma Junwu as Governor and the Guangxi Provincial Assembly was restored, but Guangdong control was always effectively nominal outside of Nanning and the Guangdong Army retreated within the year amid tensions between Chen and Sun. Shortly after, armed bands nominally aligned with Guangzhou fought among themselves and Lu Rongting for power.\n\nChen Jiongming is determined to avoid a repeat of the situation, but this is no easy task. Discipline by the Yue Army has broken down the further away from home they have marched. Meanwhile, Guangxi Generals such as Liu Zhenhuan and Lin Hu, despite their rivalries, have exploited the moment to demand control over reconstruction."
 GXC.earlygame.603.a: "Guangxi ought to be governed by their own leaders, lest we be branded hypocrites."
 GXC.earlygame.603.b: "We will reconstruct Guangxi the right way this time!"

 GXC.earlygame.604.t: "Rise of the Chinese Centre Left"
 GXC.earlygame.604.d: "The Chinese centre left has long been overlooked relative to the more conservative Beiyang republic and the revolutionary Kuomintang. Made up of progressive and liberal intellectuals, they have spent most of the Xinhai Revolution and ensuing years on the sidelines, allying with various \"reformist\" warlord patrons in hopes of getting some of their ideas implemented.\n\nIn Liangguang, the Federalist movement has given birth to a small but growing centre-left wing. Chen Jiongming is the sponsor of the Public Interest Party, a Cantonese-based political party with a platform centred on Federal democracy; civil rights; free enterprise with social harmony between classes; political transparency; and the abolition of the unequal treaties, the PIP is an outgrowth of the more liberal wing of Chen's supporters.\n\nParallel to the PIP the China Renaissance Society led by Zhang Junmai. Zhang and intellectuals like him believe in a cultural, intellectual approach to democracy - he does not believe that Chinese political parties ultimately need a mass following. Instead, as part of \"China's Cultural Tomorrow,\" he argued that the Chinese are distinct from Europeans and Indians by their concern for human relationships, and therefore they should use that advantage as the basis for a new culture. That new culture was to be the bedrock of a new political and economic system.\n\nBoth groups have taken inspiration from reformist socialism, but had a violent break with their revolutionary cousins, arguing instead that socialism must be implemented in each country according to their own conditions. For the PIP, inspired by anarchist writers, they believe that villages ought to be the testing ground for developing local self-governance and the transformation of society to one with social harmony. Men like Zhang Dongsun and Luo Longji on the other hand splintered from the CSP, though retained a belief in the need for a proactive role mobilising the masses."
 GXC.earlygame.604.a: "By promoting self-governance from the village level, we will build a new culture."
 GXC.earlygame.604.b: "Through culture and human relationships, we can build a new village system."

 GXC.earlygame.701.t: "Chen Jiongming's Demilitarisation Plan"
 GXC.earlygame.701.d: "Chen Jiongming's victory in the Liangguang Civil War has brought some economic stability, but the war has also drained Guangzhou's coffers. This is a very familiar problem to Governor Chen, who spent much of his earlier stints as Governor cleaning up the financial mess left behind by Sun Yat-sen and often lost power as a result. If there is any consolation, this time the situation is not quite as bad - the war was over before too much devastation could be wrought.\n\nStill, the same dilemma that divided Sun and Chen in the 1920s has returned, but only he now remains to decide its resolution. In the past, Chen wanted to reduce military expenditures by disbanding half of the 120,000 or so troops they had at the time, arguing that only 4 divisions were needed for Guangdong's contribution to national defence. He sought to use the money for local reforms which he believed would ultimately allow for national reforms after negotiations with Beiyang. Sun on the other hand had a quixotic dream for national unification from the top down, and was desperate for money to fund his Northern Expedition.\n\nThe Kuomintang's Northern Expedition failed utterly, but that is of little solace to the burgeoning Liangguang government. Political negotiations with Beiyang fell through in the brief period it was attempted, and the Zhili proved it was possible to unite China by force. As Chen Jiongming weighs the merits of making cuts to military expenditures, it is understood that his loyal Yue Army would be spared from the bulk of it.\n\nHowever, his allied warlord armies (especially those that defected at the end of the war), nervously await their fate. The main units in question however are the prized divisions of the old Liangguang order, often built along Western lines. While their weapons may ultimately be replaced (though most will be taken home by departing soldiers or sold on the black market), the cohesion and training of these troops will be missed."
 GXC.earlygame.701.a: "Sun was wrong to rob the people for his vain quest."
 GXC.earlygame.701.b: "But having quality divisions is needed to protect the people."

 GXC.earlygame.702.t: "A New Governor for Guangxi?"
 GXC.earlygame.702.d: "Guangxi's reconstruction is ongoing, and according to Federalist principles local elections (usually decided by local elders) are to be held for the assemblymen. After elections, the Guangxi Provincial Assembly will finally resume operations. When it does, it will elect a new Governor, who ostensibly will be an equal partner to Governor Chen.\n\nIn practice, it is understood that Guangzhou will be calling the shots in Nanning. Chen's Yue Army will effectively decide which of the Guangxi legislators will be allowed to return to their seats, and which incumbents will \"not seek re-election.\" Most Guangxi leaders who remain are seeking to play ball with their new overlords anyhow.\n\nLeft to their own devices, the assembly would probably choose either Liu Zhenhuan and Lin Hu. Liu Zhenhuan is an ambitious warlord who long dreamed of ruling Guangxi. The well educated officer came to blows with Lu Rongting in the 1910s, looking down on the newly appointed Governor as little more than a bandit. As a result, he ended up spending the majority of his career ironically in Guangdong, leading his band of Guangxi soldiers and allying on-and-off with Chen Jiongming. Liu believes himself to be the natural choice for Guangxi, and to keep up with the appearance of democratisation, he has made inroads with the FCDP.\n\nLin Hu was a triumvir of the Young Guangxi Faction that ruled Lianggunag after Lu Rongting's death. A former ally of Chen Jiongming, he entered negotiations with Chen as his forces moved into Guangxi, with the expectation he and the old Guangxi establishment would be left in control of the province in exchange for their submission.\n\nA dark horse candidate is Yin Ji, a Hunan-born Yue Army officer that once served in Lu Rongting's government but was ultimately forced out of the Guangxi Clique in 1917 due to their xenophobia."
 GXC.earlygame.702.a: "Liu Zhenhuan was promised the position after all."
 GXC.earlygame.702.b: "Lin Hu will ensure a stable transition to Federalism."
 GXC.earlygame.702.c: "Yin Ji is a loyalist we can trust to oversee the reconstruction."

 GXC.earlygame.703.t: "Liu Zhenhuan's Rule over Guangxi"
 GXC.earlygame.703.d: "Guangxi has spent the better part of the last year or so under Governor Liu Zhenhuan, who has ruled with the endorsement of Chen Jiongming, exerted power through his \"Guangxi Army\" loyalists (a term that initially arose because they were Guangxi soldiers operating in Guangdong, and now made redundant), and has bridged the divide between the Guangxi establishment's desire for a native with some independence and the Guangdong's desire to exert control over Guangxi.\n\nLiu was the son of a wealthy family and educated in a traditional manner, and was said to be generous, hospitable and chivalrous. He got his start in the Xinhai Revolution as a Tongmenghui member, fighting as a militia commander in Linzhou under his cousin Liu Guxiang. His cousin rose up for the losing side of the Second Revolution, and was betrayed by Shen Hongying, so Liu Zhenhuan was forced to flee to Hong Kong with a small band of loyalists. He was able to slowly rebuild his forces in Guangdong, and spent the 1920s as an independent actor, bouncing between allegiances to different factions in Guangzhou until he was finally defeated by the Kuomintang in 1925.\n\nHis exile in Hong Kong saw him spend much of his fortune feeding his opium, prostitution, and gambling addictions. Thankfully for him, the situation changed before he could waste all of it, and in 1928 he was commissioned by Chen Lianbo to raise an army to resist Guangxi domination. He never abandoned his dream to rule over Guangxi, and was finally rewarded by the Federalist government\n\nLiu's rule over Guangxi has not quite been what his patrons wanted. A colourful figure who retains many of his vices, he nevertheless has expanded civilian rule in the province - leaning on his ties to old Political Science Clique bureaucrats and FCDP intellectuals. He has leveraged his alliance with the Yue Army to keep the Old Guangxi warlords suppressed, but has utilised Guangxi's spirit to keep Guangzhou at a distance."
 GXC.earlygame.703.a: "Liu is quite adept at maintaining his own power."
 GXC.earlygame.703.b: "His PSC ties have brought some liberalism into Guangxi."
 GXC.earlygame.703.c: "The DSP has been courting him to expand their influence."

 GXC.earlygame.704.t: "Guangxi Drifts Away Under Lin Hu"
 GXC.earlygame.704.d: "Unwilling or perhaps unable to afford a prolonged occupation of Guangxi, the Yue Army largely pulled out of the province in favor of leaving allied Guangxi General Lin Hu to be elected Governor. The establishment favourite and a member of the old Young Guangxi triumvirate, little has changed in Guangxi over the years as a result.\n\nLin has been a career soldier, starting as a civilian participant in Lin Yongfu's Black Flag Army in Taiwan resisting Japanese occupation. A soldier under Huang Xing during the Xinhai Revolution, Lin steadily rose through the ranks of the Old Guangxi Clique. After a disastrous defeat in the First Yue-Gui war, Lin Hu was forced to resign and go into exile. A year later, he returned at Chen Jiongming's (his former enemy) invitation to help resist Sun Yat-sen but they were ultimately beaten.\n\nHe spent 1923-1925 briefly eclipsing Chen in Eastern Guangdong, becoming the nominal leader of the United Forces Office which sought to align with Beiyang against the rising Kuomintang, and was even named Governor of Guangdong for a spell. His forces were destroyed in the battle of Mianhu, forcing him to flee to Shanghai. Ma Ji's return to Guangxi gave him an opening to return to power and he once more found himself under Lu Rongting's command.\n\nWith his independent history, Lin largely does not need Chen Jiongming for power after his initial election, and he has mostly steered Guangxi inwards - only nominally taking directives from Guangzhou. This might be for the best in some regards: a docile, isolationist Guangxi may be less of a threat than an actively defiant one and puts Guangdong in the driver's seat. Still, Chen hopes to at least coax some cooperation out of Lin."
 GXC.earlygame.704.a: "Lin Hu continues to rehabilitate old Guangxi figures to support his independence."
 GXC.earlygame.704.b: "Chen Jiongming is able to pressure him into military coordination."
 GXC.earlygame.704.c: "Lin Hu's retreat into isolation has empowered the Guangdong establishment."

 GXC.earlygame.705.t: "The Death of Governor Yin Ji"
 GXC.earlygame.705.d: "Governor Yin Ji, appointed by the Guangdong Clique to oversee the completion of Guangxi's Reconstruction, has died of illness. A bright and ambitious young man born to a poor Hunan family, he entered military service under Chen Zhaotang (a subordinate of Viceroy Cen Chunxuan) and fought rebels in Guangxi. He became a favourite of Chen, which allowed him to attend the Guangzhou Military Academy in 1905. There he befriended Deng Keng, but surrendered rather than fight during the Second Revolution.\n\nHe then became a soldier under Lu Rongting during the National Protection War. He and his troops entered Guangxi while marching behind Lu Rongting's forces on the way to Changsha, and after Yuan Shikai's death Yi was sent as Lu's emissary to negotiations with President Li Yuanhong. By then however, the Guangxi Clique began to distrust him as a non-Guangxi native and he was sidelined.\n\nYi then entered the service of the Guangdong Army, serving under Hong Zhaolin. An apparently popular officer while stationed in Chaomei, he nevertheless came into conflict with Hong and was forced to leave. During the 1920s, both the Beiyang and Guangzhou governments courted him and he decided to side with Chen Jiongming but his rivalry with Hong forced him to retire even before 1925.\n\nAs governor, he has been a reliable administrator, noted for his public works and charity projects which has helped him shore up his position despite being an outsider. He was still reliant on Yue Army support to maintain his rein, but this was decreasing by the time he suddenly died of illness.\n\nHis death leaves little excuse for the Yue Army to maintain their occupation, with reconstruction mostly complete the Guangxi establishment has sought to elect Lin Hu as his replacement. General Liu Zhenhuan would likely be the closest thing to extending the status quo, though Chen Qiyou and PIP leadership have proposed Lei Rongke, the civilian PIP mayor of Nanning installed."
 GXC.earlygame.705.a: "Alright, it seems Guangxi is ready for Federal rule under Lin Hu."
 GXC.earlygame.705.b: "With our help General Liu could win the election and complete the mission."
 GXC.earlygame.705.c: "Lei Rongke will be the symbol of a new, brighter future for Guangxi."

 GXC.earlygame.706.t: "The Election of County Magistrates"
 GXC.earlygame.706.d: "The County Magistrates are an essential part to Chen Jiongming's vision of Federalism. Serving as the Executive Branch of each county, Chen put special emphasis on their training and selection - tasking them with suppressing \"local evildoers\", resolving gentry-peasant disputes, enforcing compulsory education, promoting the local economy, managing local militias, and implementing political reforms.\n\nThis programme is hardly unique to Chen, indeed leaders across the national and the political spectrum have emphasised the county's role in the nation's revival. They all have encountered similar problems: corruption, incompetence, and a lack of funding for training and oversight. Chen has sought to address this by having trusted officials go from county to county to conduct audits and crack down on the practice of grain tax-farming schemes.\n\nAs Chen attempts to revitalise the magistrate system across Liangguang, a familiar debate has followed. Initially, Chen had sought the direct election of magistrates but in 1920 he ended up implementing a compromise system where county assemblies would nominate a list of three candidates who the Governor would then choose from. The election of county magistrates, traditionally appointed by the Governor, was nevertheless unprecedented at the time. There were quite a few accusations of electoral fraud, which Chen deferred to the newly empowered local judiciary (Fanyu county in particular gained notoriety for declaring elections invalid twice in a row) to resolve, but the Federalists viewed the elections as a success despite difficulties caused by war (Chen was in Nanning on a campaign)\n\nIn 1920, an attempt to implement direct elections was shot down by Chen's allies in a tight assembly vote. In the leadup to these fresh county elections, a new movement to implement direct elections has emerged. If implemented, its proponents say it would be a victory for democracy, but some argue that it will simply empower local elites."
 GXC.earlygame.706.a: "How can a Governor away on military campaigns select our magistrates?"
 GXC.earlygame.706.b: "With electoral fraud an issue, surely the Governor ought to have some say?"

 GXC.earlygame.707.t: "The Guangzhou City Government"
 GXC.earlygame.707.d: "In 1921, Chen Jiongming penned the Guangzhou provisional city charter, placing the city directly under the Provincial Government. The city was to be led by a 7 person executive committee headed by the mayor and 6 commissioners for finance, safety, education, health, public works, and utilities. A 30 person municipal advisory council was also to be created with 10 appointed by the governor, 10 elected by the public, 3 by the chamber of commerce, 3 by labour organisations, and 1 each by educational, medical, engineering, and legal professional groups.\n\nThe mayor was supposed to be elected democratically, but the commissioners were to be appointed by the governor upon advice by the mayor - controversial among many democrats who wanted the committee fully elected. Chen Jiongming however argued that this system was hardly unprecedented and in any case the provisional charter was to be a five year teaching tool: afterwards they could always revise it.\n\nThe Provincial Assembly raised objections to charter however, passing its own version of the charter and expressed frustration over being treated as \"if they were five years behind their compatriots in rural counties [who were allowed to elect their magistrates] with respect to political awareness and intelligence.\" Despite these protests, Chen pressed on and implemented his charter regardless.\n\nThe subject ultimately rendered moot. Across the next 15 years, there was never a democratically elected Mayor - Chen appointed Sun Yat-sen's son Sun Fo as Mayor, the KMT regime appointed their own mayors, and then the Germans appointed Chen Lianbo, who remains the incumbent. Chen Jiongming has promised the mayor stability, but his erstwhile ally Zhang Junmai has emerged as a vocal critic of the system, arguing that since the Mayor and Commissioners all appointed, they are all basically bureaucrats. He has demanded elections for the entire committee and council, ruffling feathers even if Mayor Chen himself is likely to win reelection."
 GXC.earlygame.707.a: "We already made a deal with Chen Lianbo and the municipal government."
 GXC.earlygame.707.b: "A revision to the city charter is a decade overdue."

 GXC.earlygame.708.t: "Democratic Education in Liangguang"
 GXC.earlygame.708.d: "Perhaps Chen Jiongming's proudest accomplishment during his rule in the 1920s was the establishment of an independent educational system. Chen opposed the KMT's party-ification of education and the late Qing reformers' efforts to imitate Meiji Japan's system, arguing that \"education is basic to the reconstruction of a nation. Under normal conditions, a healthy nation should devote considerably more than half of its annual expenditures to education...every penny we save will be returned to the public for the reform of education.\"\n\nThe traditional department of education was abolished in favor of a nonpartisan provincial educational committee tasked with developing and managing a provincial educational system. The committee was to include four gubernatorial appointments and four elected by the Presidents and Professors of higher educational institutions and despite the controversial influence of syndicalists like Chen Duxiu, the Governor viewed the project as a success\n\nTo ensure its financial independence, he and the committee sought to raise money for an endowment but failing to do so they instead settled on allocating a portion of stable revenues such as tobacco, spirits, and land deeds taxes to fund provincial education. The provincial constitution even included a section that said no more than 30% of the annual budget could be spent on military affairs and at least 20% had to be spent on education.\n\nZhang Junmai and his allies have praised these efforts, but have also expressed the need of democratic education. They argue that the Chinese race is democratic by nature but needs reinforcement to appreciate political democracy rather than benevolent dictatorship, a need greater than combating illiteracy. Taking a quasi-religious tone, these intellectuals and men like them have made it their mission to \"enlighten the masses\", even comparing themselves to early Christians in their perseverance."
 GXC.earlygame.708.a: "Well surely teaching democracy is part of civics?"
 GXC.earlygame.708.b: "We ought to keep education strictly non-partisan."

## NPA Political Event Chain (800-829):
 GXC.earlygame.800.t: "The Old Order Holds in Liangguang"
 GXC.earlygame.800.d: "In the end, the revolutionary zeal of the Kuomintang and the republican idealism of the Federalists were insufficient to topple Lu Yuguang and his allies. Rallying their forces, they repelled external invasions by KMT forces and crushed rebellions by socialists, bandits and Cantonese warlords alike. On the surface at least, the old status quo has been restored, with the Young Guangxi Faction remaining dominant in Guangxi, the Shen Army Faction holding onto Shaoguan and northeastern Guangdong, and Chen Lianbo and his Cantonese allies holding onto southern Guangdong.\n\nThere is no going back however. The collapse of the old Zhili Order continues to reverberate across China. Even in Liangguang, the power vacuum left behind by the brief period of disorder has shaken the foundations of the post-Northern Expedition system. Power is consolidating away from local, petty warlord factions into the hands of the three remaining strongmen: Lu Yuguang, Shen Hongying, and Chen Lianbo. The latter two are scrambling to secure control over Guangdong, resuming a long-standing battle in the east. The victor may even prove strong enough to challenge Lu Yuguang for all of Liangguang.\n\nFor now however, Marshal Lu and the Young Guangxi junta remain in control over the region. They will have to navigate uncertain winds as Liangguang enters the crosshairs of the mighty contenders seeking to unite the nation. Perhaps they will join a side, or perhaps they will create one of their own."
 GXC.earlygame.800.a: "The way things were, but not quite what it ought to be."

 GXC.earlygame.801.t: "Regionalist Powers Hold Onto Liangguang"
 GXC.earlygame.801.d: "Despite the zeal of the Kuomintang and the enthusiasm of the Federalists, in the end regionalist forces were able to repel the invaders and crush domestic uprisings. Within a few months, all major cities and strongholds were in the hands of the old powers that be in the twin provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi.\n\nThe most dominant is the Young Guangxi Faction of the Old Guangxi Clique, led by Lu Yuguang, adopted son of famous warlord Lu Rongting. He shares power with other warlord cliques including Shen Hongying in Shaoguan and Chen Lianbo in Guangzhou. Seeking to protect their autonomy, they face difficult questions ahead as they navigate China's fractious politics."
 GXC.earlygame.801.a: "Order returns to Liangguang."
 GXC.earlygame.801.b: "We must prepare for a war of liberation!"

 GXC.earlygame.802.t: "North and South"
 GXC.earlygame.802.d: "Lu Rongting made several careful alliances with northern factions, both in hopes of peacefully ending the civil war and in hopes of preserving his own power and the region's autonomy. This policy carried over to Lu Yuguang's rule, however tensions between Lu, the League, and the Zhili central governments prevented more indepth cooperation between the three.\n\nThe fiery collapse of the League in 1936 has allowed Liangguang to achieve de facto independence once again, but this situation cannot last forever. While there is significant support for self-rule and distrust towards Beijing, there is no support for secession. Either Liangguang will have to align with a government or they will have to create one of their own.\n\nOf course, Marshal Lu has time to play his cards and the Old Guangxi Junta will be carefully eyeing the situation to maximise their advantage in negotiations. But the Zhili and Fengtian Cliques - and possibly others too - will begin applying pressure along with their foreign backers and their agents within the region to bring us into their spheres. As internal and external affairs begin to overlap, we would be wise to tread carefully."
 GXC.earlygame.802.a: "We welcome these emissaries of peace."
 GXC.earlygame.802.b: "We must find our own path towards unification."

 GXC.earlygame.803.t: "Politics of Southern China"
 GXC.earlygame.803.d: "Southern China is an extremely politicised region, a revolutionary hotbed since the Taiping Rebellion. It has been home to several anti-Beiyang movements in the post-Xinhai Era, including the National Protection War, the Constitutional Protection War, and the Kuomintang and Federalist movements. Guangzhou in particular was the temporary capital of several of those governments, giving it a degree of legitimacy for those seeking to unite the nation.\n\nThe Beijing side won the civil war after the Northern Expedition and has sought to undermine the political importance of the city. They have used divide and conquer tactics to keep the south apart, and Liangguang even moreso, in hopes of preventing a new challenger from emerging. Nevertheless, Guangzhou remains an important target, both for factions seeking to stake their claim for national leadership and for Northern factions seeking to reassert their control over the south. It will not be long before someone seeks to make their move on our territory."
 GXC.earlygame.803.a: "We must be vigilant against these traitors."
 GXC.earlygame.803.b: "We need to present a vision of our own."

 GXC.earlygame.804.t: "The Lesser Factions of Liangguang"
 GXC.earlygame.804.d: "It is almost a foregone conclusion that Liangguang will fall to one of the three major warlords in the province or to external invaders. However, there remain some minor factions searching for a chance to wedge themselves into the political scene. They are mostly rooted in the cosmopolitan city of Guangzhou, but have some affiliates deeper inland.\n\nThe Political Science Clique is the oldest, a remnant of a different time in Liangguang. A loose collection of politicians, scholars, businessmen, and warlords once associated with Guangdong Governor Cen Chunxuan, his political demise in 1918 and the overthrow of other aligned PSC figures in southern China broke their power. Cen died in seclusion in Shanghai in 1933 and PSC figures have scattered - grafting themselves onto other strongmen. In Guangzhou, their remnants gather around Lin Zhengxuan, who managed to carve a role as Speaker of the Provincial Assembly, and the disgraced warlords Liu Zhenhuan and Yang Ximin.\n\nThe younger factions share a fascination with the West with the PSC, though in different ways. The Jingxing Society was founded by students studying in Germany and grew in influence as Sino-German Cooperation deepened. In Guangdong and Guangxi, the most prominent Jingxing affiliates are Zhu Jiahua and Ma Junwu respectively. Another German educated scholar is Zhang Junmai, who has founded the National Renaissance Society, which seeks to use education to propel China towards a democratic future along a blend of Social Democratic and Liangist lines. Lastly, there is the Public Interest Party founded by Chen Jiongming and other Chinese Hongmen (described as the Chinese Free Masons) which seek to implement Federalism in China. Their master defeated in battle, its remnants have rebased to Hong Kong."

 GXC.earlygame.804.b: "The JXS mirrors the world's hegemon."
 GXC.earlygame.804.c: "The Democrats give scholars hope for the future."

 GXC.earlygame.805.t: "Ideology and the Regionalists"
 GXC.earlygame.805.d: "Though Warlords have often been pragmatic and idiosyncratic in their beliefs, it would be a mistake to think they are ignorant or uneducated. Chen Lianbo and other Guangzhou warlords from wealthier backgrounds received modern, Western-style educations from either elite schools in China or abroad. And even those from bandit or military backgrounds like the Old Guangxi Clique often surround themselves with well-educated advisors and keep up with modern political trends, both out of respect from the traditional roles of the Confucian-Scholar literati and also out of a pragmatic desire for legitimacy and survival.\n\nLiangguang is a melting pot of beliefs. Even with the Kuomintang and Federalists driven underground, debate over Confucianism, the New Culture Movement, liberalism, nationalism, modernisation, and other ideologies continue. Lu Rongting, for his part, took a mixed approach towards progress, embracing nationalism and the republican revolution but often retaining existing local political systems in Guangxi. His efforts to preserve order and build roads was commended, but his authoritarianism, distrust towards revolutionaries, and corruption by Old Guangxi Clique officers led to his downfall.\n\nHis successors in Liangguang are generally on the conservative end of the Chinese political spectrum though not necessarily reactionary. There is a growing understanding that change is needed, but how far and how fast is another question."
 GXC.earlygame.805.a: "We are the force of modern change in China."
 GXC.earlygame.805.b: "We will uphold China's traditional values."

## NPA Political Tree Events (830-859):
 GXC.earlygame.830.t: "Minority Groups in Guangxi"
 GXC.earlygame.830.d: "Guangxi is an extremely diverse province. Han Chinese make up about 60% of the population, having migrated to the region in several generations and often intermarrying with other ethnic groups. The north and west tends to speak a southern sub-dialect of Mandarin while Cantonese tends to be spoken in the central region and southwest. Scattered in the east and southwest are Hakka speaking Han groups in Guangxi.\n\nThe Zhuang people primarily live in western Guangxi around Yulin. They tend to speak Cantonese and live in different clans, each with their own leaders. These clans are often described as temporary groupings rather than distinct cultural entities, adding to the dynamism of Guangxi politics. Nearly 37% of Guangxi are Zhuang and they are said to be generally assimilated to the broader Chinese identity.\n\nSmaller ethnic groups in Guangxi include the Yao people, which speak a variant of the Hmong-Mien language group. Some groups apparently practise slash and burn agriculture and migrated to the area as late as 1870. The Miao traditionally claim to have originated from Siberia and also speak a tongue of the Hmong-Mien language group that is tonal, monosyllabic and lacks a written language. They tend to dislike large villages but are capable farmers when settled, proficient in farming corn despite an apparent lack of mathematics or calendar. They are also apparently excellent singers. Lastly the Yi people, also described as the Lolo, have some branches in Guangxi and have a written, pictographic language that appears to be part of the Tibeto-Burman family. They are known to be monogamous and chaste.\n\nThe Guangxi Clique is known for its relative tolerance for ethnic groups, granting them semi-autonomous tribal areas. Though the Qing dynasty worked to slowly eliminate them, these writs have largely been ignored."
 GXC.earlygame.830.a: "Together we are strong."

 GXC.earlygame.831.t: "Halls of Jade, Lorded by Tigers"
 GXC.earlygame.831.d: "The rulers of China ever since the failure of the Northern Expedition and their successes in the Zhili-Fengtian Wars, the Zhili Clique has, for all their pretenses, never truly been united internally. Serving more as a dissident force to fight against mutual enemies, the Zhili family tree is fractured and split, with subfactions upon subfactions of alliances and deals between family members.\n\nWith their seat of power lying upon the Central Plains, their reach in the South is limited to a few garrisons or loyal compradors; Tang Xiangming, Yang Sen, Liu Cunhou, or the Southern Zhili Governors of Jiangxi and Fujian. From 1928 to 1936 the Zhili attempted to demonstrate their capacity to rule the South through various means, but ultimately had to rely upon the Old Guangxi Clique.\n\nDivided between the North Zhili of the Tianjin-Baoding Group and the Luoyang Faction, alongside the Southern Zhili dominated by Sun Chuanfang, the \"two\" horses of the Zhili have largely backed separate parties in the race ever since the early 1920s. Ranging from Chen Jiongming, to Shen Hongying, to Ma Ji, and various other minor warlords within Liangguang: the Two Yangs, for example\n\nFor their efforts, and under the Southern Zhili's extensive support, Shen Hongying and his Shen Army faction of the Old Guangxi Clique has become the Zhili's most dependent ally, albeit Lu Yuguang and the Young Guangxi Faction of the Old Guangxi Clique posed a far stronger ally, and are on close terms with the Zhili. Germany, for their part, has approached members of the Pro-German Jingxing Society, hoping to keep an ace in their sleeve.\n\nFor their interest, the Zhili have far larger issues to focus on than the affairs of Liangguang, and so what scant support they can provide is limited largely towards a single faction: the Shen Army, or the Young Guangxi Faction and its Young Marshal of the South, or perhaps even simply backing the Two Yangs; Yang Chisheng and Ruxuan, the most loyal force within the region."
 GXC.earlygame.831.a: "Perhaps Wu Peifu still retains fondness for Ma Ji?"
 GXC.earlygame.831.b: "They may be bandits, but they're our bandits."
 GXC.earlygame.831.c: "The Zhili opt to support the Two Yangs."

 GXC.earlygame.832.t: "Crushing the Kuomintang"
 GXC.earlygame.832.d: "For the fourth time, once more the Kuomintang lies devastated and defeated once more. While previous attempts at resurrecting the Chinese Nationalist Party were led by the party's charismatic leader Sun Yat-sen; the death of the esteemed early revolutionary and political leader led to a power struggle between the party's leadership in 1925. The failure of the Northern Expedition, the Shanghai Uprising of 1932, and now their attempts to secure Liangguang for the Party - have shown outside observers the clear writing on the wall - that the Kuomintang is now defeated for good. Books, pamphlets, and journals belonging or adjacent to the Kuomintang are publicly burnt and rebel leaders are routinely hung or executed in a gruesome suppression of the radical revolutionaries.\n\nWhile main rebel forces have effectively been crushed by the various factions vying for power and legitimacy across the province; rebel guerrilla forces including those belonging to Peng Pai or the former Mingan Insurgency base have fled into the mountains and hills of southern China in isolated pockets. With rumours of severely weakened but surviving arms shipment routes from Shanghai or Hong Kong; many within the government have advocated for simply outright crushing these isolated pockets. Any of their aspirations for an attempt at a provincial takeover can be regarded as dead in the mud but their continued resistance may prove to be an annoyance to local governance and an issue of constant banditry. On the other hand, there are those within the New Guangxi and New Guangdong factions of the Kuomintang that may be more amicable with our Republican ideals. With Marxist-tinted socialism absent from their ideology; these former rebels and politicians may be inclined to work with our ranks and secure their positions; having realised that the Kuomintang dream is effectively destroyed forevermore in Liangguang."
 GXC.earlygame.832.a: "Let there be no rest for these rebels..."
 GXC.earlygame.832.b: "...because we need them in this fight."

 GXC.earlygame.833.t: "Dismantling the Yue Clique"
 GXC.earlygame.833.d: "Towering, charismatic, and ambitious - Chen Jiongming has long been a towering figure in local Guangdong politics. The Hakka native has been a player in the region from his early days as a revolutionary alongside Sun Yat-sen; to ousting the latter in a bloody coup and while he was once believed to have been amicable to the Zhili dominance of China - it's clear that Chen and his Yue Army had ambitions of their own. In their failed attempt to usurp our position in Liangguang; the fate of Chen and his Federalist movement effectively lies in our hands.\n\nThe Yue Army, led by Ye Ju and including prominent Guangdong Clique military officers such as Luo Xianxing and Ma Yuhang, lies at our mercy having been defeated in the skirmishes and battles across the province. Despite their opposition, many of their officers are perhaps some of the better trained throughout the province. Within their ranks amicable to our principles of provincial regionalism and republicanism; the Yue Army will likely be absorbed into Chen Lianbo's army.\n\nThe same applies to the provincial gentry which may have backed Chen but ultimately are interested in keeping their own lands and property safe from the radicalism of communism. Local landlords, village chiefs, and town mayors have pledged their loyalty in exchange for maintaining their posts. Warlord ties to the southwest for instance, may be exploited by Lu Yuguang's Young Guangxi faction in the hopes of filling the local power vacuum while those in the northeast may find themselves in Shen Hongying's camp.\n\nWith major republican figures out of the picture, the provincial democrats and hongmen really have no one else to turn to than to the military leaders of the NPA. With ideology ever fluid and changing in China; many of these urban scholar-intellectuals are able to recognise the rapidly changing political situation and adapt their goals and movements to the current state of politics."
 GXC.earlygame.833.a: "Chen Lianbo is the natural beneficiary of Chen's fall."
 GXC.earlygame.833.b: "Lu Yuguang will consolidate control over the south."
 GXC.earlygame.833.c: "Shen Hongying's forces move into the north."

 GXC.earlygame.834.t: "Cantonese Cinema"
 GXC.earlygame.834.d: "While Yue Opera remains one of Guangdong's premier cultural institutions, growing attention in the Cantonese cultural scene has focused on the rise of a unique Cantonese cinema industry. While oftentimes overshadowed by Shanghai's booming musician and cinema industry, the first solely Cantonese film \"Two Girls Orphaned by War\" came out in 1932 followed by a Hong Kong Cantonese film \"The Idiot's Wedding\" a year later. These films have played a pivotal role in Guangdong's unique regionalist identity.\n\nTypical films encountered by film goers range from both unique plots to the general news of the day. These movies project ideals of public health, scientific, and geographic knowledge, military exploits of warlords, and even so called “phantom rides” which mount the camera on locomotives, trams, or boats shooting rapids giving film goers a sensational experience into beautiful locations around the world. Political leaders have also broadcasted addresses in Cantonese in an era where the Mandarin is still unfamiliar in regions such as Jiangmen and Sanshui.\n\nThe Nanyang Film Company founded by the Shaw Brothers is one of the most prominent film companies in China. Their recent work, the 84 min - \"Lady Luminary\" which stars Lee Yi-nin as the female lead, tells the stories of Luk Mo-ching and her adopted daughter Ng Sau-wah (portrayed by Leong Tim-tim). Luk escapes a forced marriage and an ill-fated infatuation before taking charge of a girls' school - turning her life and others around. Ng is confronted by a similar adversity. In the face of such disparate humiliation, they persevere to start their lives anew - creating an expose of China's systematic gender inequality.\n\nIn times of ongoing strife and forthcoming conflict both domestically in China and abroad; many have turned to the cinema for hope, guidance, and solitude. The Shaw Brothers are rumored to be working on a new project set in Manchuria although reports are that the film is in planning stages."

## NPA Southern Struggle Mini-Game Events (860-889):
 GXC.earlygame.860.t: "The Southern Struggle"
 GXC.earlygame.860.d: "Liangguang has long been a thorn on our side, hosting various revolutionary governments seeking to overthrow the Beiyang order. The end of the Northern Expedition and the splintering of the region into various warlord fiefdoms aligned with the Zhili should have been the end of matters, but the cunning Lu Rongting was able to reunite the region and loosen the Zhili's grip after the Zhili-Fengtian Wars and the 1932 Shanghai Uprising.\n\nLu's successors have not been nearly as successful and upon the collapse of the League Liangguang also fell into civil war. But Lu Yugguang (Lu Rongting's adopted son) along with other regionalist, reactionary forces emerged on top returning the region to the old status quo. Well, except for one matter.\n\nLiangguang remains independent, with the various warlords under Lu and his allies weighing their options. Shen Hongying, long cultivated by the Southern Zhili in Guangdong as an aligned alternative to the Kuomintang and later Lu Rongting (who in turn aligned with the Northern Zhili against Sun Chuanfang), continues to seek Zhili support. The various Zhili factions have in turn sent emissaries to him, hoping to leverage his influence to bring all of Liangguang into their orbit. Their rivals in China have in turn looked towards Chen Lianbo and his Canton Merchant Government, hoping to use the city's (also known as Guangzhou) outsized influence to gain sway over the region."
 GXC.earlygame.860.a: "We must prevail! Redouble our efforts!"
 GXC.earlygame.860.b: "Hopefully they will align on their own..."

 GXC.earlygame.861.t: "[FROM.GetAdjective] Aid and Praise"
 GXC.earlygame.861.d: "War is an expensive endeavour, even more so if you lose one. Even for those basking in the glory of victory against their foes, the destruction that is so often left upon the military and finances in the aftermath of conflict leaves much to be desired. Similarly, the victory against the incursions of the Kuomintang's forces has been a hollow one at best, its costs bearing its weight upon the regional authorities of Liangguang as industries flounder.\n\n[FROM.GetNameDefCap], viewing this as an opportunity to legitimise themselves as the true representative government of China, has approached Liangguang officials offering to provide financial aid as a gesture of goodwill in these trying times. In what some see as an attempt at flattery, [FROM.GetLeader] congratulated the people and authorities in Liangguang on their victorious resistance against the \"red menace\".\n\nTheir offer to voluntarily uplift the Liangguang economy from ruin alongside flowery words of praise have certainly made an impression among the public. The public mood seems receptive to the [FROM.Adjective] generosity, viewing it with a sense of relief in the miserable sea of languish amongst the people in the face of mass financial destitute.\n\nFor Lu Yuguang, as the nominal master of Liangguang, he remains hesitant in accepting the graces of [FROM.GetNameDef], suspicious that it would merely undermine the Young Guangxi Faction's influence within the twin provinces in favour of his regional opponents, who are more than willing to accept [FROM.Adjective] aid."
 GXC.earlygame.861.a: "How kind of them."
 GXC.earlygame.861.b: "Thanks, but no thanks."

 GXC.earlygame.862.t: "Reports of Bribery by [FROM.GetAdjective] Agents"
 GXC.earlygame.862.d: "Recruitment methods in China is different compared to other countries that have professional armies, owing the army's fractious nature, with many local warlords forming their own personal army. From street recruitment, forced conscription, and even recruitment through familial connections, local armies are often fueled by the lack of alternative employment and plagued with corruption.\n\nDesertion is a common occurrence among soldiers, whether it be out of self-preservation, disgruntlement due to personal issues, or bribery, making local provincial armies prone to disintegrate when cracks start to show. Thus, the high alert shown by the Young Guangxi junta as a reaction to reports of bribes allegedly offered to rank and file soldiers within the Guangxi Army by [FROM.Adjective] agents is natural.\n\nPossibly part of a wider conspiracy to expand their influence within Liangguang, the wave of bribes spread across the military would be spell disaster for Marshal Lu Yuguang and the Young Guangxi Faction should conflict ever emerge between Liangguang and [FROM.GetNameDef], as soldiers would start switching sides en masse the moment battle begins.\n\nTo counter this rot within the army, a comprehensive purge has been suggested by advisors to remove elements that have become compromised. Although it might affect the fighting capabilities of the Guangxi Army in the short term, with the chaotic situation that encompasses the whole of China, loyalty is most important among other traits within a soldier."
 GXC.earlygame.862.a: "Structures begin to rot as bribes are given out unhindered."

 GXC.earlygame.863.t: "Military Threats from [FROM.GetNameDef]"
 GXC.earlygame.863.d: "There are many ways to achieve political goals, either through warfare or diplomacy. When diplomacy is not achievable, many reluctantly seek war to accomplish their aims. But with the high cost it entails, some resort to military threats as a resumption of diplomacy through different means. For [FROM.GetNameDef], this seems to be the case as a telegraph has been issued to [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] from [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], warning the use of military means should their demands not be fulfilled.\n\nAmong other things, they demand that we bring in several individuals within our administration. Unsurprisingly, many of these individuals listed seem to be loyalists and followers aligned to the [FROM.Adjective] government. As bold as they are, this threat has proven rather effective at spreading fear of another imminent invasion of Liangguang by [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].\n\nMany in the twin provinces have been striken with defeatism, as unlike the swift but unorganised invasion of the KMT, public fear has been fuelled by the better equipped nature of the [FROM.Adjective] military. This has not been helped by sporadic reports of a military buildup across our border with [FROM.GetNameDef].\n\nDespite the military pressure, Liangguang's natural defences have eased minds on whether such an invasion could seriously succeed, with some considering this threat to be nothing but a bluff by [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Even so, caution fills the air in the provinces, as even a bluff could be the spark to another grander conflict."
 GXC.earlygame.863.a: "Defeatism spreads in the face of overwhelming strength."

 GXC.earlygame.864.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Accommodates Local Warlords"
 GXC.earlygame.864.d: "Although the Kuomintang's invasion was handful for the regional authorities of Liangguang, spontaneous rebellions staged by bandits and warlords across the twin provinces made an already chaotic situation far worse. In spite of this, order returned to Liangguang as these rebellions were crushed alongside the repelling of KMT forces. Broken and defeated, these warlords seemed to have been defanged, without a base of support to rely on with the dissolution of their personal armies.\n\nUnfortunately, [FROM.GetNameDef] has been reported to be accommodating these warlords, providing them with an opportune base of operations to rebuild their support, unreachable to the authorities of Liangguang. Whether this is out of apathetic altruism or a part of a wider scheme to spread their own influence within the twin provinces, it is clear this political manoeuvre has attracted concern.\n\nWhile this concern is predominant within the Young Guangxi junta, they are not alone in that sentiment. With such blatant interference in an already delicate power struggle within Liangguang, a temporary show of unity has been floated around as an avenue to combat [FROM.GetNameDef] and their supporters' rising influence in the region.\n\nFor Marshal Lu Yuguang, the support of his regional opposition, no matter how brief or superficial it may be, is necessary in securing Liangguang's autonomy. However, even with such high stakes, mistrust still exists among the regional strongmen, as personal ambitions of regional dominance still reign in the minds of some."

 GXC.earlygame.865.d: "The national unification has been the goal of many ever since China fractured with the death of Yuan Shikai. Whether through negotiations or forceful means, all efforts failing to achieve such due to a multitude of reasons. With the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces when Marshal Sun Chuanfang was shot and Qi Xieyuan took over as League-Marshal, the illusion of Chinese unity under Zhili domination was shattered.\n\nAs conflict concludes in the South with the failure of the Kuomintang invasions into Liangguang, a semblance of stability and political unity returned to the twin provinces. In the pursuit of national unification under their leadership, [FROM.GetNameDef] has approached regional authorities in the South, sending peace feelers to gauge the possibility of the reunification between the North and South, long divided in the conflict between revolutionaries and strongmen.\n\nHailed by some with Liangguang as a stepping stone towards a united China, many including Marshal Lu Yuguang and the Young Guangxi junta are skeptical to [FROM.GetLeader]'s sincerity, suspicious that it is nought but an attempt at imprinting their own influence within the region.\n\nStoking public sentiments for peace and opposition to the shedding of any more Chinese blood for pointless regionalist conflicts, those sympathetic to [FROM.GetNameDef] are increasingly gaining the favour of the public in Liangguang, to the chagrin of [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]'s leadership."

Even so, our intrigue has cost [ROOT.GetLeader] precious resources that could've been better spent elsewhere. For the time being, those within Liangguang who are sympathetic to our government have to stay put and do nought but struggle alone until we recover from this failure."

 GXC.earlygame.870.intro: "The peace that came with the failure of the Kuomintang's incursion into Liangguang was never going to last, not with a tenuous balance of power between the three strongmen of Lu Yuguang, Shen Hongying, and Chen Lianbo. Although Marshal Lu and the Young Guangxi junta were initially able to come out as the masters of Liangguang after repelling KMT forces, their grip over the twin provinces faced challenges from regional opponents, assisted by the influence of external actors."
 GXC.earlygame.870.closing: "With the autonomy of Liangguang and the legacy of his father at stake, and faced with overwhelming pressure to kneel or risk the wrath of [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], Marshal Lu considers his next course of action which will affect the fate of the Old Guangxi Clique, as well as those of the twin provinces."

This remains true today, as Marshal Lu Yuguang has stood his ground and refused to bend to pressure for Liangguang's alignment with our government.\n\nDespite this temporary setback, our efforts in expanding our influence within the twin provinces has not been in vain, as scattered rebellions are breaking out across the region against the Young Guangxi junta, both from within Marshal Lu's Guangxi Army and those led by our followers in the region. Even so, it is clear that without our intervention, this rebellion would be crushed easily, completely solidifying the Young Guangxi's hegemony over Liangguang.\n\nHence, it would be wise to commence an invasion of Liangguang during this brief moment of instability to safeguard our control over the Pearl of the South. However, there are also concerns within our government that such a blatant act of hostility would incur the distrust of other warlords in other provinces. Whatever the case, the intrigue in Liangguang has become unravelled, and its fate is at hand."

## NPA Narrative Event Chain (900-929):
 GXC.earlygame.900.t: "Rise of the Young Guangxi Faction"
 GXC.earlygame.900.d: "Lu Rongting was a mighty warlord in Guangxi, whose star shone so brightly during the National Protection War but slowly fell out of the spotlight during the Constitutional Protection Government. Despite his lowly bandit origin and ultimate defeat in battle, he remained a sort of folk hero to many and after the collapse of the Northern Expedition he was able to stage a political comeback, subduing his rivals (chiefly Shen Hongying) and reasserting control over Liangguang. After his death in 1934, he left his empire to his beloved adopted son Lu Yuguang, who was reluctantly recognised as the new Viceroy of Liangguang by the Zhili and Old Guangxi Clique.\n\nThe real power behind Nanning however is the triumvirate that forms the Young Guangxi Faction. Led by Lu Rongting's other adopted son Ma Ji, the Governor of Guangxi and an associate of Wu Peifu along with Generals Lin Hu and Liu Zhilu, they and their officers dominate the Old Guangxi Clique, and thus by extension the Liangguang government. Once the Young Guard of the Old Guangxi Clique, with most of the older generation having died or retired (including the three Great Heroes of Guangxi - Lu Rongting, Chen Bingkun, and Cen Chunxuan) and the Shen Army Faction having been pushed out, the YGF include a mixture of formally trained military men, ex-bandits, and gentrymen. Conservative, regionalist, and militaristic, the Guangxi Clans are a potent force.\n\nThat has not stopped them from being diplomatic however. The Young Guangxi Faction is noted for being generally respectful of the Guangxi Provincial Assembly and cooperative with Beiyang decrees even if they are suspicious of Zhili overreach. There are civilians and intellectuals sympathetic to their rule, including educators like Ma Junwu or the various Political Science Clique figures they have worked with over the years. Despite fiercely protecting local prerogatives, they also have an anti-imperialist streak, mirroring the rising nationalism in China."

 GXC.earlygame.901.t: "The Shen Army in Shaoguan"
 GXC.earlygame.901.d: "Shen Hongying grew up a poor bandit before being recruited into Liu Zhenhuan's Army. During the Second Revolution, he sided with the Beiyang Government and betrayed General Liu, finding employment and promotions under Lu Rongting. After Lu fell from power during the Yue-Gui Wars, he made a play for leadership of Guangxi from his base in Guilin with some support from Wu Peifu and the Zhili Clique, only to be outmaneuvered by Li Zongren and the KMT aligned New Guangxi Clique. Defeated, he fled into exile, but was able to make a return as an Zhili Clique auxiliary after the Northern Expedition. Though the title was promised to multiple warlords at once, the Zhili ultimately settled on Shen as their Governor of Guangdong.\n\nShen never truly was able to rule all of his nominal province, much less all of Liangguang. Guangdong Warlords rallied in Guangzhou under their provincial assembly and refused to recognise him. Meanwhile, he was routed in battle with Lu Rongting and lost Guilin. The loyalty of his deputies is questionable - Li Yaohan and Gu Ringguang are Guangdong warlords who already attempted to break away from him once in 1923, but found themselves once again under his command thanks to pressure from the League. Similarly Yang Chisheng and Yang Ruxuan are Yunnan-born officers, defectors from Yang Ximin's camp who found themselves under the Zhili's employ. And thus, for now at least, they serve Shen.\n\nThe Shen Army Faction also has loose ties to the Political Science Clique and Jingxing Society. However, the PSC are long past their heyday in the 1920s and many of them have gravitated towards Shen's rivals in Guangzhou, most notably Liu Zhenhuan, the mentor Shen fell out with. The Jingxing Society, generally more liberal and Western than the warlords they work with, are only really connected to Shen because of German interests in the League, both of which Shen depends on for power. So long as Mayor Chen Lianbo controls Guangzhou, Shen will never truly rule Guangdong."

 GXC.earlygame.902.d: "The Canton System ended nearly a century ago, but Guangzhou remains a valuable entrepot. When the Germans occupied it during the Northern Expedition, they installed the ambitious businessman Chen Lianbo as Mayor, a position he retained even after they finally withdrew. Chen, hoping to avoid a Guangxi occupation, hastily rebuilt a Guangdong Army with his rebuilt Merchant Corps as its nucleus.\n\nMerchant Corps exist throughout China, an outgrowth of local Chambers of Commerce. In war-torn Guangdong, the merchants sought to unite the various militias into a \"Joint Defence Headquarters\" as an alternative to warlord abuse and extortion. Membership was not limited only to merchants: small business owners and other civilians joined it and later the Association of All Classes to Save Guangdong.\n\nThe Corps became a major opponent to the revolutionary Kuomintang, with Chen Lianbo and Chen Gongshu leading the hardline \"proactive\"faction seeking to build a coalition to drive out the KMT and create a Merchant Government. The moderate \"passive\" faction was led by Deng Jieshi, who cautioned the reckless Chens against \"tricking\" the masses into an uprising. It is said that Gan Liuchi of the Merchant Gazette gave a similar warning, noting that even if they defeated Sun Yat-sen, power in Guangdong would fall into the hands of Fan Shisheng or Chen Jiongming.\n\nIronically, despite the Merchants courting them and them attempting to leverage their position as a mediator between the Merchants and the KMT, the Yunnan-born Warlords Fan Shisheng and Liao Xingchao sided with the KMT once they were offered a better deal. At one point, Sun Yat-sen said \"You could hardly be as loyal and as competent as these two!\"\n\nThe Merchants have sought the cooperation of the Zhili but with the Zhili backing the Old Guangxi Warlords, Chen Lianbo has begun to turn towards international help and the Fengtian Clique. His ambitions of creating a Merchant Government in Liangguang have not dimmed with time."

 GXC.earlygame.903.t: "Warlords, Democrats, and Socialists"
 GXC.earlygame.903.d: "The \"Democratic\" intelligentsia in China are a lot more malleable than many would expect, readily willing to work within the Warlord system in exchange for money and influence. The more successful warlords like the Zhili have been able to cultivate the image of progress and use it to their advantage against the seemingly close-minded Fengtian Clique. Knowing what to say and when to give them concessions can go a long way in securing their support without sacrificing any core policies.\n\nScholars in China have certain expectations about their relationship with the powers that be. The old Confucian literati were idolised for providing sage advice to the Emperor and his Governors, even when not holding official government roles. Even after the monarchy fell and China was embroiled in warlord conflict, this relationship between the scholars and the warlords often continued. There are many scholars in Liangguang who are willing to work with the warlords, especially against their mutual enemy in central government tyranny.\n\nThe socialists, on the other hand, are a danger that must be crushed. Not every socialist is a KMT member and not every KMT member is a socialist, but die-hard revolutionaries prefer to go down fighting rather than accept their movement is finished. While some of the old National Revolutionary Army can be safely absorbed into our ranks, efforts by various warlords to cooperate with socialist elements have always ended in violent betrayal."

 GXC.earlygame.904.t: "The Governor and the Assembly"
 GXC.earlygame.904.d: "Power in Guangdong has been divided between the Shen Army Faction in the North headquartered in Shaoguan and the Chen Lianbo Merchant Government in the South centered around Guangzhou. Shen Hongying, having been driven out of his traditional home base of Guilin, claims to be Governor while Mayor Chen is backed by the Guangdong Provincial Assembly. This stalemate has been enforced by the Lu Rongting and later Lu Yuguang regimes, hoping to keep the wealthier Guangdong divided and submissive towards their Guangxi-based government.\n\nChen Jiongming and his Yue Army's defeat in battle several years ago has created an opening for one to seize the advantage. His forces, situated primarily in the east around Haifeng county, have since disintegrated and his allies hastily absorbed into either Shen Hongying or Chen Lianbo's armies. But the crisscross of Shaoguan-aligned and Guangzhou-aligned villages is unstable, and it often feels like at any moment conflict may break out.\n\nNanning will of course work to prevent either side from destroying the other, but an opportunity to gain an advantage is there, it is just a matter of who will seize it."

 GXC.earlygame.905.t: "Power Struggle Over Old Guangxi"
 GXC.earlygame.905.d: "When Lu Rongting was driven out of Nanning by Sun Yat-sen and Chen Jiongming in 1921, it allowed rival Guangxi Clans to challenge him for supremacy across the next few years. While Lu remained dominant at first, Shen Hongying and his men allied with Li Zongren and his clique to defeat him, before General Shen was defeated in turn by the KMT backed New Guangxi Clique. Even after Lu Rongting was able to stage his comeback after the Northern Expedition, animosity lingered between Lu and his Nanning based government and Shen who entrenched himself in Guilin.\n\nWhen the Southern Zhili were distracted by the 1932 Shanghai Uprising, Lu Rongting took advantage of the chaos by driving out Shen Hongying's forces from Guilin and forcing him to recognise him as Viceroy of Liangguang. But with Lu Rongting's death, his adopted sons and their allies lack the same gravitas as the elderly Viceroy Lu had. Shen is plotting to sway the various Guangxi Clans to his side. It will take time, but a showdown feels inevitable between the Viceroy and his Governor."

 GXC.earlygame.905.b: "The Young Marshal is an unworthy successor."

 GXC.earlygame.906.t: "Wealth and Power"
 GXC.earlygame.906.d: "The relationship between the two Guangs has soured over the years, with mutually brutal occupations damaging the heavily intertwined provinces. As Lu Yuguang and the Young Guangxi Faction work to provide \"good governance\" to the people and exert their authority over Guangdong, they clash with Chen Lianbo and his Guangzhou Merchant government which seek to protect Cantonese autonomy and their business interests along the Pearl River.\n\nSmuggling has become a major flash-point between Lu and Chen. As the Young Guangxi Faction attempts to levy higher taxation on Guangdong to fund the military, the merchants have responded by levying some of their own towards Guangxi citizens. Despite being a militia, the Merchants Corps is not a threat to be taken lightly - many of their men are trained and led by military veterans and they can afford imported western weaponry. They also have a reputation for brutality, executing suspected socialists, with some even accusing them of organ harvesting. Politically they can also be tenacious, when fighting the KMT they distributed letters attacking the Three Principles and insisted that the KMT was inviting infighting among the Chinese while making foreign imperialists rich.\n\nIf the Nanning junta would like to undermine them, the easiest target would likely be Li Fulin, an ambitious warlord that worked with Merchants using his personal army to establish a protection racket before joining the Kuomintang as their Fifth Army as the tide turned only to realign with the Merchants after the German occupation ended. He is said to be back to his old tricks, providing \"security escorts\" for merchant caravans and smugglers into Guangxi."

 GXC.earlygame.907.t: "The Hainan Conflict"
 GXC.earlygame.907.d: "Though the worst impacts of Black Monday have begun to fade, there are still many unemployed in Guangzhou and other Guangdong cities, particularly those who lost jobs abroad and were forced to return home to a war-torn country with few opportunities or social services. The Provincial government, for their part, has tried to alleviate the homeless problem by authorising the mint, Department of Finance, and secretly the army to help them find employment.\n\nAfter deliberations, it was decided that they would deploy hired labourers to Leizhou Peninsula and Qiongya Island, territory contested between local warlords and bandits. Many workers were killed as they tried to clear forests due to poor conditions and bandit raids. The region is divided between territory held by rival warlords Lin Hu and Liu Zhenhuan on the mainland, and Qiongya by the autonomous warlord Deng Benyin, who drove out Old Guangxi Clique garrison commander He Fuchang many years ago before entrenching his rule over the island.\n\nLu Yungao, a retired Old Guangxi Military commander noted for his feat of raising 20,000 caddies of military rice and aiding in the recapture of Nanning in 1922, had been tasked with this project but has recently fallen ill. Both Liu and Deng are tied to Chen Lianbo's Guangdong faction and are said to be stepping up their resistance to Old Guangxi interference. Given the difficulties, it may be worth backing down."

 GXC.earlygame.908.d: "Liangguang, the premier province of Southern China, has long been a hotbed of cultural and political sovereignty from the rest of China's many provinces. Since the Song Dynasty's resistance to the Mongols, to the Ming Dynasty's liberation of China from the humiliation of barbarian rule, their long-standing resistance towards Jurchen incursions, to now in the present era - the birthplace of Chinese republicanism and opposition towards the oligarchs and autocrats of Beijing.\n\nThe leaders of the various cliques such as the Old Guangxi Faction and the Shen Army - pride themselves on their regional independence. Abstaining from declaring outright secession as many are indeed truly Chinese nationalists and fervent republicans; they are dedicated to the unification of the Chinese country on their own terms - rather than from party dictatorships like the Kumointang or unrealistic dreams of a federalist country. Rather, unification will have to come from their own terms and likely from the tips of their soldiers' bayonets. The odds are of course ever so stacked against these republicans but when has the cause for freedom ever been achieved easily?"

 GXC.earlygame.909.t: "November 4th and the Warlords"
 GXC.earlygame.909.d: "What started as a student movement amongst Beijing's universities (Peking and Tsinghua) in November of 1919, soon escalated into nationwide unrest and protests against imperialism. The leaking and release of various Entente telegram cables promising Japanese and German concessions in Shandong as a result of their declining fortunes in the World War - ignited a fierce anti-imperialist sentiment with many across the country fearing that China was to be carved up once more. The spirit of the Xinhai Revolution, intended to drive out imperialism and to modernise the country, seemed to be on the verge of disintegration following the brief reign of Yuan Shikai and the prospect of a centuries old civilisation torn to shreds at the whims of foreign imperialists.\n\nThe November 4th Protests however did not merely spark the flames for the greater anti-imperialist movement. Passionate revolutionary writers such as Hu Shi, Li Dazhao, and Cai Yuanpei took it upon themselves to embrace the \"New Culture Movement\", a period of rapid intellectual curiosity that championed intellectual triumphs, political and societal liberalism, and the adoption of modern norms and customs. Their revolution however was also curbed by conservative nationalists who sought to revive China's position in the world but also to reduce the excess of cultural degeneration. Guangdong's provincial warlords have tended to sympathise largely with the ideological currents of the much more conservative November 4th movement; championing national industrialisation and modernisation synthesised with a growing Chinese nationalism - rather than an outright denunciation of Chinese culture. As the new year has come and Liangguang's position driven by the fates of wind once more - a united policy on how to interpret the November 4th Movement will surely galvanise support from differing ideological and political factions; bridging their divides and leading the charge for a true Republican unification for the rest of China."

 ##RKMT First Congress Chain (400-429)
 GXC.midgame.400.t: "The Chairman Returns"
 GXC.midgame.400.d: "After enduring a tense voyage, Hu Hanmin, the enigmatic leader of the right wing of the Kuomintang, has finally returned on Chinese soil for the first time in a decade. His brilliant mind and towering figure casts a long shadow over the warlord junta, almost immediately dwarfing them in influence.\n\nA devout revolutionary Hu Hanmin remained largely aloof from the fanfare surrounding his return, greeting the crowds before quickly focusing on more pressing matters. Meeting with various Liangguang power players, including Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, and Chen Mingshu, he has behaved cordially, stating his gratitude for their support whilst keeping thoughts of their crudeness mostly to himself.\n\nOrthodox and studious in approach in interpreting the Three Principles, Hu Hanmin is perhaps the most premier expert on the true intentions of his late mentor, Dr. Sun Yat-sen. During his bitter exile, he has formalised his thoughts by writing the \"Linkage of the Three Principles\", the contents of which seem to have set the groundwork for not only the First Repatriated Congress, but for the Kuomintang movement as a whole.\n\nThe start of the party congress has also marked the grand return of the Moscow Committee, and the election of a fourth Central Executive Committee. With 24 members in total, the Central Executive Committee now includes key Moscow figures such as Hu Hanmin, Lin Sen, Ju Zheng, Zou Lu, Li Liejun, Yu Youren, Ding Weifen, Gu Yingfen, Wu Heling, Ye Chucang, Qin Zhen, Shi Qingyang, Shi Ying, Shen Dingyi, Ye Chuqian, and Fu Rulin, alongside more regional figures: Chen Jitang, Lin Yizhong, Li Zongren, and Bai Chongxi.\n\nThe Central Supervisory Committee has been constituted by Zhang Ji, Xie Chi, Lin Yungai, and Mao Zuquan.\n\nNotably in absentia is Sun Fo's Reconstruction Faction, corresponding to Sun himself, Wu Chaoshu, and Wang Kunlun in the CEC, and Liang Hancao in the CSC. Serving as an open invitation to the Hawaii Clique, one Hu thoroughly believes Sun can hardly resist, many believe it is a matter of time until he defects to Canton."
 GXC.midgame.400.a: "A spirited return, Chairman!"

 GXC.midgame.4000.t: "The Guangzhou Nationalist Government"
 GXC.midgame.4000.d: "When the Kuomintang first retook control over Guangzhou, there were questions about the direction of the revolutionary junta. The issue appears to be settled now, with the rightist officers Chen Jitang and Li Zongren successfully outmaneuvering leftist Chen Mingshu take take control of Liangguang.\n\nThey have invited Hu Hanmin and his exiled rightist central committee to return from Moscow. Hu, a preeminent disciple of Sun Yat-sen, ironically was defeated in a similar power struggle between feuding triumvirs after Sun's death, but he has no intentions of failing this time. He has already announced plans to rebuild the party-state in Guangzhou and prepare for another Northern Expedition to reunite China under the three principles."
 GXC.midgame.4000.a: "I suppose he will expect us to send emissaries soon."
 GXC.midgame.4000.b: "May we soon find further allies for our cause."
 GXC.midgame.4000.c: "The revisionist rat returns to Guangzhou..."
 GXC.midgame.4000.e: "Another Guangzhou government?"

 GXC.midgame.401.t: "Imperialism vs Anti-Imperialism"
 GXC.midgame.401.d: "In an auspicious start to the First Congress of the KMT, Hu Hanmin has let his intellectual prowess flourish. Elaborating the points he made years ago in Linkage of the Three Principles, he has showcased his refined expertise and interpretation of the Three Principles, hitting back at imperialism all around the globe.\n\nPontificating about how the world is a battleground between the two antagonistic forces of imperialism and counter-imperialism, he argued that the capitalist system brewed a militarist and hostile society. Similarly to Marx before him, Hu Hanmin has deemed capitalism in of itself to be the arch-foundation of Western political institutions. Being eternally corrupted by the influence of bureaucratic worshipping of absolute statism, capitalism, and militarism, these states enlist the support of capitalism to advance their imperial glories. In turn, the capitalists feed off the bureaucrats, using them as spokesmen for their system to leech off of nations. In combination with this, both the forces of the bureaucrats and capitalists utilise the military to advance their collective interests and conquer other nations.\n\nFurthermore, Hu stated that this all began in the distant 1500s as the burgeoning colonial empires competed for land and influence, causing the rise of mercantilism. Deeming this a prototype of capitalism, it began to evolve with the political liberalisation and economic laissez-faire in the periods of peace afterwards, culminating in the modern global economic system. Neo-imperialist colonial forces fused domestic nationalism with imperialist goals to subjugate China into a semi-colonial status.\n\nRelating his theory back towards the National Revolution, he made a clear connection between anti-imperialism and Sanmin doctrine, with which it is imbued with knowledge from the past three centuries of revolution, arguing that the Kuomintang must join China with liberation movements worldwide to bring about imperialism's downfall."
 GXC.midgame.401.a: "Down with Imperialism!"
 GXC.midgame.401.b: "Surely, he cannot be serious?"

 GXC.midgame.402.t: "Nationalism in the East vs West"
 GXC.midgame.402.d: "Like a whirlwind, Hu Hanmin followed his lecture on imperialism today with one about the First Principle of the People, Nationalism. He states that whilst nationalism is not a concept unique to the Principles, the West have corrupted their idea of it, using it as a force of imperialism and slavery. Dr. Sun, by contrast, has turned it into a mechanism of liberation and freedom.\n\nDrawing comparisons between the East and West, Hu stated that the West's primary unit of society is the individual, and its individualism created a vacuum between individual and the state, creating a discord between them. The West, as a result, lacks a \"wholeness of nation', the people in the Three Principles of the People.\n\nMeanwhile in China, Hu indicated that the historical clan formed the basis of society, providing an advantage in the formation of a nation, and in fostering budding nationalism. Hu Hanmin argued that due to the West's development of nationalism around fervent individualism, they naturally became the architects of selfishness and imperialism. Meanwhile the clan-centred nationalism of China has been integral in building the nationalism found in the Three Principles, which unites the nation towards the Datong, the Great Harmony between the people.\n\nHu's claims are particularly striking, because traditional intellectuals have long seen clans as a stumbling block for China's budding nationalism. Many see clans as a source of regionalism, and critics of the Chairman believe he lacks a plan to organically combine the interests of the nation, nationalism and the clan unit."
 GXC.midgame.402.a: "Nationalism for a new China!"
 GXC.midgame.402.b: "Much thought, but with little concrete planning."

 GXC.midgame.403.t: "Democracy and Anarchism"
 GXC.midgame.403.d: "Like clockwork, Hu Hanmin began discussing the Second Principle of the People, Democracy. Drawing inspiration from universalism and humanism, the Chairman believes that the Three Principles are the superior method in achieving the ideal state of human society. Universalism, anarchism, and syndicalism, state institutionalism, nationalism and capitalism, have all failed.\n\nWhile the Principle of Nationalism is aimed at attaining freedom and equality for nations all over the world, he stated that freedom and equality at home cannot be achieved without the fulfillment of the Principles of the People's Political Power and Livelihood simultaneously at home. Once all nations achieve this tripartite nationalism, universalism will consequently dawn.\n\nDrawing comparisons between the Principle of Democracy and anarchism, stating that it entails people's control of political power in one nation, and then followed by political equality. Whilst both ideologies share goals in ending the state, anarchism left a void in where political power would vest.\n\nUnder Sanmin, power would be divided between sovereignty and administrative power. The first would be directly vested and exercised in the people, consisting of the four powers of election, legislation, referendum and recall. The second would be indirectly invested in the people through the five yuan: executive, legislative, judicial, examining and supervisory. This five branch government will become the instrument of the people to achieve true self government.\n\nContrary to common misconception, Hu Hanmin argues Proudhon and Kropotkin envisaged repeal of the state, but not the government. With Sanmin, elected government officials and the people would work in tandem for public interest, and with its political power deprived, the state would wither away in favour of absolute personal freedom. Therefore the Three Principles share the ideals of anarchism but the KMT actually gives a feasible programme to achieve them."
 GXC.midgame.403.a: "Only the Principles can give us democracy."
 GXC.midgame.403.b: "Walking a fine line, Chairman..."

 GXC.midgame.404.t: "People's Welfare and Socialism"
 GXC.midgame.404.d: "Once more in his flurry of theory, Chairman Hu Hanmin has focused his sights on the Third Principle of the People, People's Welfare. Drawing comparisons between People's Livelihood and the nascent Socialist and Syndicalist movements around the world, he has noted the radical difference between the three in implementation.\n\nWhilst all intended to achieve the ideal society, only the Three Principles were equipped with the instruments to transform these common ideals into reality, of which included land equalisation and capital regulation. Once private ownership of the land and capital is abolished, socioeconomic injustice would go with it, and the cannibalising class struggle would be avoided. Instead of violence, the national operation of conglomerates of railroads alongside mining and steel companies would create profits directly for the people.\n\nTaking a brief aside in his oration, Hu Hanmin drew a comparison of anarchism and Marxism, praising anarchists like Bakunin and Kropotkin. This anarchic socialism retained the structure of society and individuality of the person, the Chairman even claimed that Bakunin-Kropotkin's school was close to Sanmin, as opposed to Marxian proletarian dictatorship and belief in anarchist opposition to any form of social order. Concluding, Hu declared that governments which enjoyed Marxian political dictatorship and thorough control of the nation's wealth were more inclined to totalitarianism.\n\nConcluding his speech on People's Welfare, Hu Hanmin quoted Dr. Sun, in that: \"..Humanity's endeavour for survival had been the moving force of social progress...class struggle was actually a social illness during the progress\", further adding that class struggle merely arose when man felt compelled to rise for survival. With this he indicated that Marx had mistaken the cause for the consequence and vice versa, with Hu stating that the Three Principles would create a new world desired by all revolutionary movements."
 GXC.midgame.404.a: "To aid the People!"
 GXC.midgame.404.b: "Need I remind you, we're not the Left."

 GXC.midgame.405.t: "Development of the Revolution"
 GXC.midgame.405.d: "Having secured favourable, if perhaps sometimes reluctant official party endorsements for his prior statements, Hu Hanmin has shifted his attention towards the practical implementation of the Principles, barely giving anyone time to rest after discussions.\n\nThe Chairman began by stating that the policies of land equalisation and capital regulation would gear the national economy towards eventual public ownership of national wealth, Gongyou, and that the two arch-enemies of economic equity, both state alongside private capitalism, would be subsequently eliminated. Through joint government-people economic endeavours, with close cooperation between the two would finally lead to Gongyou.\n\nScientific Production would reduce the workload, and increase the productivity of the people further liberating their minds and energy from the drudgery of work. Through this the people could devote themselves to creative, cultural and public work, and eventually step up to take on local responsibilities which would pave the way for self government. Once this scientific production is achieved, common enjoyment of social wealth (Gongxiang) would be underway.\n\nHailing scientification as speeding up the process to achieve Gongxiang, in the ideal world envisioned by Hu Hanmin, the ancient ideals of \"From each according to one's ability and to each according to one's needs\" would become a social reality. However the Chairman clarified that he did not consider absolute equality necessary as long as every member in the society was free from all sorts of wants."
 GXC.midgame.405.a: "Steward of the Revolution!"
 GXC.midgame.405.b: "We have hardly started uniting the nation!"

 GXC.midgame.406.t: "The Revolutionary Future"
 GXC.midgame.406.d: "In a bold display of his renewed authority as Chairman of the Central Executive Committee, and nominal leader of the Right wing forces of the Kuomintang, Hu Hanmin has unequivocally declared that Dr. Sun's will was for the Three Principles of the People - Nationalism, Democracy, People's Welfare - to be enacted immediately, simultaneously and at every stage of the National Revolution\n\nDespising the pitfalls and vile deals that his rivals Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei made, Hu Hanmin insists that even during the stage of military rule, every principle should be enacted lest the loyal revolutionary soldiers turn into merely new warlords taking a more pleasant form. In fact, he has placed special emphasis that the party should never neglect the people's interests during the stages of revolution, most important of which being the period of tutelage.\n\nHammering in his credentials as having the most orthodox comprehension of Dr. Sun's ideals, Hu Hanmin has further stated that the new National Revolution will follow the National Reconstruction Plan laid out by Dr. Sun in unyielding absolutism. The Constitutional Stage then would only be enacted in provinces once its counties had achieved local self-government. Once more than half of the provinces have reached that stage, a national convention would be assembled to promulgate a national constitution.\n\nIn his concluding statement, Hu Hanmin expressed his desire to achieve Datong - the Great Harmony - saying that agape should be cherished as the foundation in man's endeavour for existence. While many of his warlord patrons had already begun to have second thoughts about inviting his return, for a shining moment the generals all felt small as Hu's words landed on the audience. With his eclectic blend of Chinese social ideals, Christian socialism and modern scientific advancement, Hu promises to combine them all into a true formula for man to achieve Great Harmony. Basking in revolutionary glory, the audience roared in applause."
 GXC.midgame.406.a: "To a bright future!"

 GXC.midgame.407.t: "The Fate of the Fourth Army"
 GXC.midgame.407.d: "Amongst the attendees of the First Conference sits a selection of individuals most disagreeable to the new alignment of our government. The former MinGan officers associated with Chen Mingshu and his old Tenth Division were invited to attend the conference as an expression of unity between the wings of the Kuomintang.\n\nAligned with the centre-left, Chen and his allies find themselves stuck between a rock and a hard place. Finding few friends and considerable ire within the conference, it is clear that they have been outflanked by Chen Jitang. At the same time, they fear repercussions from their former leftist allies, who have long condemned them for working with the right in any capacity.\n\nTheir apparent duplicity has finally caught up with them, with Hu Hanmin being presented with the option to oust them from the conference for their ties to Wang Jingwei. Many of their former rivals in Guangdong like Chen Jitang have pressed the Chairman for their expulsion already charting out plans for an aggressive military campaign and political purge.\n\nHu however has been more circumspect. An olive branch would weaken Wang's committee and counterbalance his dependence on Chen Jitang, and if successful could further showcase his capability to lead the Revolution. On the other hand, Chen Mingshu is known to be a vehicle for leftist infiltration and tolerating him may have reverberations that follow."
 GXC.midgame.407.a: "No mercy for our adversaries."
 GXC.midgame.407.b: "Benevolence is a virtue."

 GXC.midgame.408.t: "The Fourth Army Retreats"
 GXC.midgame.408.d: "Reports have arrived on Wang Jingwei's desk of various leftist officers from the province of Guangdong having fled persecution from the incumbent government there. Their leaders are General Chen Mingshu and his lieutenants Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai, all who carry valuable skill sets and knowledge that could be put to great use in the future.\n\nDespite this, Chen Mingshu has evidently proved himself to be a failure, having lost control of one of the most valuable provinces in China and his political moment crushed by Hu Hanmin and his warlord allies. His inability to complete his mission however is hardly the only obstacle in his reconciliation - many reports indicate his wavering loyalty to our central committee and his foolish flirtations with the right.\n\nThus, their prospects of redemption are tenuous. While he has begged that he be given another chance to prove his loyalty to the National Revolution, offering to leverage his knowledge of Liangguang to our advantage, even his former allies in MinGan are reluctant to intercede for him. Ultimately, his fate will be decided in a closed central committee meeting."
 GXC.midgame.408.a: "Forward, together."
 GXC.midgame.408.b: "Punish him for his failure."

 GXC.midgame.409.t: "The Fourth Army Defects"
 GXC.midgame.409.d: "Disturbing reports have emerged from the situation in Canton, as news reaches the Chairman's desk of the fallout of our rival committee's First Repatriated Congress. Reportedly our key agent in Guangdong, Chen Mingshu, has defected to the right, bringing much of the Fourth Army with him.\n\nAlready various figures within the party are rife with anger from the betrayal of what was supposed to be one of our most elite armies, and all support for Chen Mingshu and his movement being cut. Despite our retribution for such an insolent act, he has claimed that by remaining within the rival apparatus, he can serve as bridge between the Left and Right, being able to provide a diplomatic link between Wang Jingwei and Hu Hanmin. In fact he has gone as far as to petition Sun Fo to lobby for leniency, suggesting that his heart is truly dedicated to our cause, and he continues to press on for the implementation of the Three Principles."
 GXC.midgame.409.a: "The utter insolence!"
 GXC.midgame.409.b: "He could still remain useful..."

 GXC.midgame.410.t: "Hawaii's Prodigal Son"
 GXC.midgame.410.d: "Although much has been said about Sun Yat-sen's three great heirs (Wang Jingwei, Hu Hanmin, and Chiang Kai-shek) and their corresponding wings of the party, the Kuomintang luminary actually left behind one child active in politics: his only son, Sun Fo. An American educated, fairly successful Mayor of Guangzhou noted for his successes in reforming city administration and carrying out public works projects during the Constitutional Protection Junta era, even before Sun's death he was sidelined by his father due to his opposition to the reorganisation and his failure (or perhaps unwillingness) to squeeze out further funds from the city entrusted to him for the war effort.\n\nThe elder Sun's death in 1925 left Sun Fo and his \"Crown Prince Clique\" to the mercy of violent political winds as he unsuccessfully tried to find footing - initially joining with rightists in the Fourth Plenum before being cowed into submission by Wang and the left. The collapse of the Northern Expedition saw Sun flee to Hawaii with many of his followers, trying in vain to promote reconciliation between the exiled Moscow and Paris committees. During that time, he and his allies contributed to the \"Reconstruction Review\" magazine, which became the nexus of his \"Reconstruction Faction\".\n\nWhile many dismiss him as a dilettante, unworthy of his father's mantle, that has not prevented both Hu and Wang from courting him, especially as he successfully retained his father's considerable connections across Chinese diaspora communities in Southeast Asia through his \"Overseas Chinese Commission\". The collapse of leftist fortunes has seen Sun Fo return to Guangzhou, ever shameless in his opportunism. Still, Chairman Hu has been quite courteous in his welcome, and Sun's much vaunted connections and prestige has caused many centre-left party figures to return to the fold, including his close allies in the so-called \"India Clique\"."

 GXC.midgame.411.d: "The Kuomintang's defeat in the Northern Expedition did not cause the Chinese Nationalist Party to collapse. While the Party's main body fled overseas to the radical hotbed of Paris, Hu Hanmin and the right-wing leading members of the KMT sought refuge in Moscow. A cadre of important KMT leaders professing their dedication and loyalty to Sun Yat-sen's revolution created a separate rival government-in-exile with a Central Committee.\n\nRussia offered a place of refuge for the Chinese exiles due to a shared hatred of Germany's imperialism. For us, Germany has torn apart our great country, plundered our resources, and seeks to keep Russia weak. For the Chinese, the Germans have carved up their country with their colonial enclaves and reinstalled a deplorable imperial dynasty while crushing their desires for independence. It was only natural that our peoples would come together and look towards realising the destruction of both Japanese and German imperialism to pursue a world free from the chains of Berlin and Tokyo.\n\nFurthermore, both the Chinese exiles and the Russian government are united in their own shared distrust of bolshevism. In 1928 the Kremlin chose to cooperate with the KMT government-in-exile in tacit approval. Support mostly came in donations and military aid procurement although relations between Russia and the Chinese nationalists faltered during the CER War in which Fengtian victory led to more extremist Russian factions to denounce the Chinese exiles in Russia.\n\nNonetheless by 1936, these angers have mostly subsided and we have received news that the KMT has seized victory in their former province of Guangdong led by the Russian exiles. We wish the best in their pursuits for national unification and only time will see whether or not the Kuomintang can truly rise again."

 GXC.midgame.431.t: "The Divided Revolution"
 GXC.midgame.431.d: "Perhaps the greatest irony of the Kuomintang is that despite their insistence on strict, one-party orthodoxy (founded as a reaction to the unwieldiness of the old Tongmenghui), the Party has always been plagued by ceaseless infighting. Or perhaps it is their authoritarian nature itself that lends to such factionalism. Either way, the heirs of Dr. Sun were fighting over his inheritance even before he died, with the party first fragmenting into regionalist blocs, and then into right and left factions under Hu Hanmin and Wang Jingwei. Chiang Kai-shek soon formed his Whampoa military based clique in the party centre, right and left further divided into smaller squabbling factions, and so forth - a division that continued even after a long exile.\n\nIn Liangguang, the party remains fiercely divided. Subduing the two provinces required the combined efforts of three armies, each with their own vision for China. Still, it is not too late for [ROOT.GetLeader] to heal rifts, even if the scars will remain.\n\nThe Guangdong left is a broad array of disgruntled urban syndicalists, radicalised peasants, and more moderate leftist revolutionaries. A targeted effort to court the last group may be what is needed to isolate the extremists and present a message of reconciliation.\n\nOutside of Liangguang, republicanism retains plenty of sympathisers, including many wealthy liberal donors who felt marginalised by the party's reorganisation and drift away from its more democratic, Western-inspired roots. The largest faction directly associated with the Kuomintang is the Overseas Chinese Commission, dominated by but not exclusive to Sun Fo and his allies. Their ties across Chinese diaspora communities across Southeast Asia make them invaluable.\n\nOf course, the Kuomintang's right is itself quite factionalised. Focusing on shoring up our own support base and fostering unity within our existing coalition perhaps is ultimately better than making hollow promises to those who deserted us."

 GXC.midgame.432.t: "The Three-in-One System"
 GXC.midgame.432.d: "As the Kuomintang aims to shake up ossified local power structures across Liangguang, the New Guangxi Clique have begun merging the posts of village head, militia chief, and school headmaster as part of their ongoing project to implement a citizen-militia system. This is not entirely without precedent; China has suffered a major shortage in competent personnel and money for salaries.\n\nFor Guangxi, however, the aim is more than just saving costs for a poverty-stricken province. Coining the slogan \"to institute a new government, employ new people\", the clique has advertised their programme outside of the province in very ideological terms. Advocates argue that concentrating power into one pair of hands not only alleviates the shortage of capable individuals and cuts costs, but also interlocks the vital functions of government, military, and education.\n\nThe backlash has been fierce. Traditionally, the position of village head was voluntary, which meant only the gentry usually took such an unpaid position. Many of these new leaders have been mocked as being arrogant despite having only received 6-18 months of government training, often compared to miniature emperors with nicknames such as the \"Centipede Who Flies to Heaven\" and \"Iron-Headed Ancient\".\n\nReports grow of newly appointed officials falling victim to plots by the displaced local elites, including attacks by hired bandits. Resolving this crisis has divided provincial leadership. Some have advocated for an iron hand, drafting \"Regulations Regarding the Punishment of Local Despots and Evil Gentry\" and calling for the deployment of troops to troubled areas such as Guhua and Rong. Others have advised a tactical retreat, sharing more power with the traditional elite and stressing the temporary nature of these programs. Failing to do so may result in the very sabotage of citizen-militia implementation by unsympathetic local leaders that the Three-in-One System was meant to prevent."

 GXC.midgame.433.t: "The Government in Guangdong"
 GXC.midgame.433.d: "Governor of Guangdong, Chen Jitang, has recently launched a series of enterprises within his home province aimed at training a new generation of low-level functionaries for the party. In reality, Chen Jitang is rather aloof in such civilian administration matters, and it would appear these initiatives are spearheaded by his close ally, Lin Yizhong. The \"Advanced Political Study Course\", as it is known, is a new set of subjects and topics that are available in the Guangdong Military Political Academy. Ostensibly loyal to the National Revolution, some within the party fear that their loyalties instead lie with Chen Jitang himself, and not the Kuomintang's ideals. Alongside this, the New Guangdong Clique have also launched a \"Three-Year Administrative Plan\" aimed at creating a \"model, new Guangdong\". Whilst fairly uninvolved in actual civil matters, Chen Jitang's underlings still continue to run these schemes under his supervision.\n\nHis disinterest in such affairs is not any more evident than in the fact that in checking the time scheduling of the Guangdong Provincial Government, one can see that Chen Jitang is hardly present in any official capacity, except for one occasion in which he was a non-voting observer. Quick to staff the government with his allies and cronies, he has even went as far as to present positions to Liu Jiwen, son-in-law of Elders Clique and Central Executive Committee member Gu Yingfen, and even to Lin Yungai, Supervisory Committee member and a protégé of Hu Hanmin himself. In a further display of political manoeuvring, his \"local self-government\" schools and Guangdong Cooperative Movement have further overtaken local administrations.\n\nEvidently, some within the party are keen to criticise such blatant extensions of his influence and are already calling for official condemnation of his actions, however others fear the repercussions given Chen Jitang was a key player in the restoration of the Committee, and his influence as Guangdong Governor."

 GXC.midgame.433.b: "Abhorrent behaviour!"

 GXC.midgame.434.t: "Unscrupulous Influences"
 GXC.midgame.434.d: "In the course of the National Revolution, there has always been the ever present question regarding finances for the Government's operations. In the past the Kuomintang have had a variety of financial backers of varying degrees of commitment, however in the present imperialist world that has an overwhelmingly unfriendly opinion of our movement, and without posturing ourselves as lapdogs to Paris or London, we are bereft of options to fund our government - not aided by the recent global economic crisis. An enterprising option that is unfortunately widely used by regional warlords within China is to influence the trade of opium within and without the province, and our warlord allies have taken two wildly different approaches to such matters.\n\nIn Guangxi, the New Guangxi Clique's Provincial Government Office of Opium Suppression has - as the name suggests - taken to heavily taxing and suppressing the opium trade in the province, raking in such absurd revenues as to account for 50% of total provincial revenue per annum. However in an opposing direction to this in Guangdong, Chen Jitang has employed the strategy of influencing and controlling the trade of opium, using a variety of backhanded tactics such as suppressing smuggling yet keeping the stocks of opium to distribute to the Opium Suppression Bureau when needed.\n\nSuch actions have - perhaps indirectly - lead to a signifiant loss of revenue for the New Guangxi Clique, as opium commonly flows between provinces, and Li Zongren has sent a flurry of demands to [ROOT.GetLeader] insisting that Chen Jitang must cease his brazen infringement on the Guangxi economy. On the other hand, besmirching Chen Jitang with such an action could result in a burning of invaluable bridges needed to maintain course in the National Revolution."

 GXC.midgame.435.t: "The Revolutionary Youth"
 GXC.midgame.435.d: "As the National Revolutionary wave advances, one cannot leave the youth behind. Even before the doomed Northern Expedition, there was a series of planned initiatives to incorporate youth movements into the party apparatus. Now the party has the bandwidth to entertain such projects.\n\nHu Hanmin and his allies have drawn from his previous writings exploring the socio-physiological allure of left-wing activism for the youth He claims the modern Chinese youth are in a collective state of depression, virile yet directionless, but with a lust for everything life has to offer. In such circumstances, it is natural that they are attracted to mass movements to direct their fury and frustration. In order to counteract this, the Chairman has devised a series of scouting movements aimed at carefully managing youth of both sexes towards learning productive skills and contributing to society.\n\nSimilar in implementation but not in approach, liberal party members including Sun Fo have partnered with Yan Jialin and the western inspired Scouts of China. Hoping to utilise pre-existing programs for ease of implementation, they hope this approach will teach the youth both patriotism and personal independence in life.\n\nIn stark contrast, the New Guangxi Clique have condemned the promiscuous, renegade lifestyles of the youth. Accusing them of fearing neither public opinion nor law, Li Zongren has come to refer to them as the \"new scholar gentry,\" whose only goal in life is to make money as soon as possible, escape from rural life, build a Western-style home, and enjoy the comfort of coastal metropolitan lifestyles. Rather than allow these corrupt youth to create an evil atmosphere in society, they and other conservatives have pushed forward a series of militaristic initiatives to prepare them instead to become disciplined, model citizens and revive Chinese culture."

 GXC.midgame.436.t: "The Sinews of War"
 GXC.midgame.436.d: "Within the province of Guangdong, there was always an ever independent streak amongst its residents - as indicated by being a hotbed of revolutionaries - and this has gone as far as to extend even into local currency. Continuously, the provincial governments of Guangdong minted their own special currency functioning in parallel to the central currency controlled by Beijing. This is not a new practice however, as even as far back as before the turn of the century, Guangdong had minted its own local provincial silver currency.\n\nAlbeit with the unification of the country steadfast in its progress, an influx of counterfeit and regional currencies have started circulating in our economy, with many maintaining questionable value. We could order the Banks to accept all currencies as comparative in value, and in exchange issue a more centralised currency to eventually achieve equalisation in our economy, slowly phasing out the illegal regional currencies. However this would be a slow and gradual process, and could still present a headache for years to come.\n\nAnother option presenting itself to our government is to instead mint an entirely new set of central currency, reforming the currency centrally around one in which we can control to supply and demand. Whilst this would naturally lead to much outcry from the citizenry as their currency may soon become worthless, it might be the necessary step required to truly unite the nation.\n\nInternally the Kuomintang are much divided on such matters, with the regionalists within the New Guangxi and New Guangdong cliques both pulling their weight behind a gradual phasing out of regional currencies, as opposed to the slash and burn centralisation desired by the Elders Clique and its allies."
 GXC.midgame.436.a: "Maintain acceptance of all currency."
 GXC.midgame.436.b: "Mint a new set of currency, for the whole nation."

 GXC.midgame.437.t: "Health of the People, Health of the Nation"
 GXC.midgame.437.d: "Since the early days of the movement, the Kuomintang have linked Chinese public health initiatives with the spiritual health of the nation. Fitting, as their founder was also educated as a physician before he strove to heal the sickness plaguing the nation. In Guangdong, the various party intellectuals and the provincial administration have continued existing health programs, a cause célèbre on both the left and right, many which began during the party's initial 1920s rule in Guangzhou.\n\nIn Guangxi, where there is a widespread lack of healthcare access, an even more ambitious project is underway. The New Guangxi clique has begun a centrally planned effort, dividing the province into public health regions. Each region was to have a provincially funded hospital, opening new ones if none existed, expected to provide inoculations, collect health statistics, erect quarantine stations, and provide various other services. To support this expanded system, public health committees has been organised to manage it, and Guangxi University has opened a new medical school to provide additional personnel, and a drug factory has been opened in Wuzhou to produce medicine, bandages, and cosmetics.\n\nThese hospitals would be the centre of the region's healthcare system, orbited by dozens of planned district clinics to serve the countryside. To work around a lack of trained doctors and funds, there are plans to place a para-medical officer in each village. In many areas, and even within Kuomintang intellectual circles, traditional Chinese medicine by local healers and apothecaries remains popular, adding another dimension to the healing process. Its practitioners claim their ways not only heal the body but also the spirit.\n\nDespite high hopes, the actual efficacy of these programs are ultimately contingent on the amount of funding they receive from the party-state's already strained budget. Moreover, in the near-term, the actual yield of these projects seem more political than practical."
 GXC.midgame.437.a: "Traditional Chinese practices help the people make do in trying times."
 GXC.midgame.437.b: "A robust public health effort heals men and saves the nation."
 GXC.midgame.437.c: "The thorough Guangxi reforms should not only be lauded, but imitated!"

 GXC.midgame.438.t: "The Warlord's New Clothes"
 GXC.midgame.438.d: "In a stark contrast to his normal modus operandi, the face of the New Guangxi Clique, Li Zongren, has changed up his attitude in relation to Intellectuals Liberals and even Northern Conservatives. Paying a noticeable increase in attention to their desires, and even paying the occasional lip-service with plentiful platitudes. Li Zongren has gone further, outstretching a hand to China's regional minorities such as the Muslims - perhaps influenced by his close compatriot, Bai Chongxi - and others, showing an unheard level of benevolence and care for their strife, troubles and outlook on the National Revolution. Yet this is not all, as recently it has been reported that he has been in correspondence with Zhang Junmai, James Yen and even the distant Hu Shih. Perhaps truly and utterly, the Warlord has changed his heart?\n\nNaturally, the more sceptical and cynical within the various Central cliques dismiss such optimism, suggesting that Li Zongren is clearly just attempting a rebranding of his image as a benevolent leader, positioning himself to eventually challenge the Chairman for the throne of the Kuomintang. However, there still remains a hopeful undercurrent, as to what degree must one flee from their own principles just for a stronger attempt at capturing power?"
 GXC.midgame.438.a: "Perhaps he has achieved a true change of heart..."
 GXC.midgame.438.b: "The Revolution has no place for warlords."

 GXC.midgame.439.t: "Mencius and Socialism"
 GXC.midgame.439.d: "In Hu Hanmin's triumphant return to the forefront of Chinese politics, many have made attempts to understand what this revolutionary stands for. No other greater source of understanding the Chairman can be found than his revolutionary writings and journals from days long past, albeit not all have been accepted unambiguously. One that has drawn particular ire, even from his close allies in the Western Hills Clique, is \"Mencius and Socialism\", an immensely contentious piece in which the Chairman argues that traditional Chinese Philosophy is actually incredibly compatible with Socialism.\n\nWithin the piece, he praised the great Chinese philosopher, Mencius, and his stance on the division of labour: those who did mental work and those who performed manual labour. Believing in a fair system in which all would be entitled to work and to live a decent life of dignity, the Chairman agreed with Mencius that man has inborn differences in talent and ability, and that Socialism's abolition of levels was wrong since people should be rewarded proportionate to their contributions.\n\nHowever, in ensuring people's rights to a decent life, Hu proposed the establishment of a genuine constitutional democracy, believing that the ideals of Socialism also had merit in China, as those concerned for the poor had throughout its long past had long sought solution to the perennial phenomenon.\n\nNaturally the fiercely anti-Socialist stance within the KMT Right has led to a series of scathing letters landing on the Chairman's plate, accusing him of betraying Dr. Sun or even folding to the Left. The Chairman could defend his previous writings, showing that he has true and utter commitment to the revolution here and now. He could however, simply ignore the outcries and blowback, and focus on his work, for what can his political opponents do in light of the results he'll achieve?"
 GXC.midgame.439.a: "An embarrassing display!"
 GXC.midgame.439.b: "The Chairman defends his stance!"

 GXC.midgame.440.t: "Cadres, Cooperatives and the Countryside"
 GXC.midgame.440.d: "To mobilise the people, the nationalist government has promoted the expansion of cooperatives as a means of reforming China's local governments. While the KMT is hardly alone in bemoaning the demise of the Chinese village, their fears that the new cooperatives will drift from the Party's charted course has pushed them to take a strong hand, with close involvement at every stage. According to party officials, these cooperatives fulfil the six responsibilities of local government during tutelage: First, compiling a modern census. Second, to break down notions of private property. Third, financing public works and infrastructure development. Fourth, improve grain management, grain storage, and welfare services. Fifth, open new lands for cultivation and reforestation. And Sixth, promote local self-government.\n\nThe cooperatives themselves are designed with parallel structures to the provincial and national government, with Credential Committees modelled after the Examination Yuan, Management Committees acting akin to the Executive and Judicial Yuans, and Inspection Committees imitating the Control Yuan. The Kuomintang theorise that the people's participation in these organs would convert villagers into citizens, educating them on the Four Rights set by Dr. Sun.\n\nOn the ground, these efforts at establishing cooperatives have received a mixed reception, with many young idealists wholeheartedly embracing the programme with stride while more cynical comrades resist these programs, fearing the consequences prematurely handing power to illiterate bumpkins. Still, a generation of party \"cooperative guides\" fan out into the countryside, spending months on propaganda and investigative work and promoting joint meetings of party, government, and educational institutions to supply information about and to the people of the area. Whatever the party's leaders may say in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], these nameless cadres will decide the fate of the cooperative movement."
 GXC.midgame.440.a: "The enthusiasm of young activists inspire the people!"

 GXC.midgame.460.t: "A Critique on the Critique on Historical Materialism"
 GXC.midgame.460.d: "In a time not too far from our very own, the Chairman himself represented a peculiar branch of revolutionary Socialism, and as his national prominence has risen, so too has his earlier political opinions come to light. However not all of his prior, more radical, work has been derided as naivety in youth, as an old paper written during [ROOT.GetLeader]'s revolutionary Socialism days has resurfaced, and begun to serve as a foundational piece of literature for the modern Kuomintang cause.\n\nIn his \"A Critique on the Critique on Historical Materialism\", the Chairman fully defended historical materialism, arguing that Karl Marx's theory of social progress and Charles Darwin's theory of evolution combined thoroughly explain humanity's moral precepts. In the Chairman's eyes, economic activities were the centre-piece of social life, and the fundamental moving force of historic evolution. He argued that Marx didn't exclude other factors from influencing human development, but singled out economics as the most important force.\n\n[ROOT.GetLeader] can be quoted as writing: \"The productivity in a society constituted the basis for the change of production methods in it. Although also subject to various kinds of influences, once formed, the new production methods possessed the power to determine the process of all the aspects of the superstructure in the society. It was true that all new production methods owed their invention to man's though, that was nevertheless first influenced by material life. Man's thought evolved in response to the social needs, thus serving as medium for social progress\".\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding the paper, the Chairman and his allies have increasingly seen it become integrated into the Kuomintang's philosophy, accepting Marxist materialism yet rejecting the class struggle accompanying it. Naturally, his critics have accused him of socialist infiltration, and being unfit to lead the Kuomintang's National Revolution."

 GXC.midgame.461.d: "In his skyrocketing popularity, [ROOT.GetLeader] is finally able to put action behind the ideas he has formulated during his exile, and even further before during the 1920s, and as such a revival of the Chairman's ideas has begun to popularise them amongst his followers and the broader Kuomintang movement. Some of the most notable, have been brought to the forefront.\n\nOne of the most peculiar concepts to spur from this time in his life, the Chairman argues that China was always a class society, with the ruling classes (Emperor, Father, Husband) imposing their ethics on the ruled classes (Minister, Son, Wife) to the former's advantage. Simultaneously, they exercised absolute authority, and so consequently there was a class struggle as the ruled classes attempted to overturn traditions that were irrational, arbitrary or inhumane. Unfortunately little has changed since the Qin dynasty as the production methods have similarly remained unchanged.\n\nMoving to a broader scope, the Chairman states that historically there were 3 stages of development. Pre-Qin, there were Five Codes, or the Five Teachings: the father should act with righteousness, the mother with benevolence, the elder brother with sibling love, the younger brother with respect, and the son with filial piety. Following into the Warring States period, Confucius and Mencius created the Five Ethics in order to govern the princes, however this was distorted into the Three Bonds, which demanded total submission to the Emperor, the Father, and the Husband, lasting for 2000 years."
 GXC.midgame.461.a: "Hu Hanmin's wisdom knows no bounds!"

 GXC.midgame.4610.t: "Linking Qin Legalism towards Women's Liberation"
 GXC.midgame.4610.d: "Discussing the connection between the economy and moral precepts in society, [ROOT.GetLeader] argues that they went through three phases: During the pre-late period, where Clan and family bonds tied people to common land and resources, in which the Five Teachings fit this best. After the Zhou, socio-economic dislocation and the development of a class of landless peasants resulted in the Five Ethics, hoping to restore peace and order in society. After the Qin, China returned to Clan orientation, paternal authority rising to absolutism, and so led to the creation of the Three Bonds Mores.\n\nTo solve such a travesty, the Chairman theorised that the rise of the Clan society was due to the agrarian economy of primitive society, and when private land ownership emerged combined, so too did a socio-economic gap emerge. Believing that the industrial revolution disrupted the patriarchy by devaluing male physical strength, he also believed that the Clan system - alongside the Modern Family unit - would unravel as Capitalism unravelled, and therefore the best solution would be for every member in society to take up a profession most compatible to one's talent and ability.\n\nWith a final footnote, the Chairman argued that a contradiction existed in the modern nucleus family, wherein women were bound to choose between tending to household chores and taking up a profession, and so the natural trend would be headed for women's liberation from confinement to their participation in the workforce."

 GXC.midgame.462.d: "Despite the fall from the throne that Hu Hanmin has experienced in recent times, Chen Jitang has continued working feverishly to ensure that despite the loss of his patron, the New Guangdong Clique shall not fall with him. In his efforts to rebound his popularity and continue to drum up support, Chen Jitang has undertaken a series of initiatives strengthening his clique's position within the nation.\n\nRecently, the governor has promised to his citizenry to ease the tax burden to soothe their troubles, however it becomes evidently clear that he has no intention of doing so; for his operations on the national stage require many funds to support them. Initially applied whenever provincial revenue was low, the tumultuous period of recent national politics has led to the governor transitioning the levies and taxes to a more permanent force within the province. In some cases, there has even been a tax applied to excrement.\n\nWorking with his close ally Qu Fangpu, the governor has begun to centralise the collection of the taxes, opening them up to bidding and ensuring that the provincial government would receive a cut. However, some issues have arisen as an additional fee is incurred in districts that host military units due to infighting. Luckily the governor has set up a committee to help oversee the distribution of revenues gained in such a manner. Controversially, the governor has enacted a strict opium and gambling tax.\n\nDespite the dire need for funds and revenue, Chen Jitang still has his obligation to end miscellaneous levies, and therefore has publicly enacted policies to reduce them - however most levies are just replaced by another, and so the burden has not truly been alleviated. Going further, the governor has even publicly attempted to reform the outdated land tax system with his new \"provisional land tax\", albeit like most of his schemes the new tax was ostensibly intended to be more fair, yet in actuality resulted in raised taxes alongside the old taxes."

The reasons for such support are myriad, however the most evident is the personal besmirching Chen Jitang received by Guangxi native Li Zongren, developing a lingering resentment for the New Guangxi Clique as a whole. Notably however, Chen Jitang has never displayed any sentiment to leave Guangdong and take the throne for himself, with his love for his home province too strong to separate him from it. Therefore it is believed that he intends to push Hu Hanmin forward to once again rise to national prominence, overcoming the usurpers and returning to his rightful throne.\n\nIn this arrangement however, Hu Hanmin has reportedly not been so willing to collude. Being a staunchly principled revolutionary from a bygone era, he balked at even the hint of posturing himself to such a corrupted regionalist as Chen Jitang, leading to many even questioning if such an alliance can come to fruition following the inherent disagreements of character between the two. Luckily for Chen Jitang, the recent turmoil seems to have shaken the ardent revolutionary's conviction, and out of pragmatism - or perhaps desperation - Hu Hanmin has agreed to cooperate with the governor in a new bid to return to national leadership once more. Their relationship, now a duopoly, has led to many in the nation asking the same question. Who is the master, and who is the servant?"

 GXC.midgame.464.t: "The Centralisation of Guangxi"
 GXC.midgame.464.d: "In their steadily increasing national popularity, the New Guangxi Clique has not led the new cornucopia of opportunities go to waste. Swiftly moving to utilise their newfound influence, they have begun to further centralise their nigh autocratic rule within Guangxi province, practically shutting out any officials from the Central Government. Due to such actions, they have managed to turn their home province into their own personal fiefdom within the nation, and have begun using it to project their power outwith the provincial boundaries, crafting a resilient political bloc even within the newly formed government. With new allies and ardent resolve, the leaders of the New Guangxi Clique have been able to punch leagues above their nominal weight in sheer numbers and wealth, and they are quickly rivalling those within [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] on the national stage and beyond, forming what amounts to a government within a government.\n\nIn their ensuing power grabs and strengthening of their position, the Guangxi Clique have pushed forward in establishing a new committee known as the \"Guangxi Joint Party, Government and Army Commission\", staffed almost entirely by New Guangxi members. With numbers shadowing the national government's very own, the committee mirrors all four organs of government, entirely compromising our national structure. As expected such a move has drawn much criticism and ire from New Guangxi's enemies, as it overshadows the already present heads of each governmental organ, along with a slew of other important high ranking officers within the army. Some accuse them of blatant factionalism, of corrupting the revolution, of even betraying the memory of Dr. Sun in the first place, yet they cannot do much but shout into deaf ears."

 GXC.midgame.465.t: "The Open Conspiracy"
 GXC.midgame.465.d: "The New Guangxi's power has nearly eclipsed that of the sun itself. With their rise from a mere assortment of warlords and their statelets within Guangxi, to the disastrous fall of the Northern Expedition under German jackboot, to again their return to both Guangxi and national prominence. Nobody could have predicted the continued resilience displayed by the clique's members, but then they have never met a Guangxi native. In all of these events, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi and the rest of the leadership have continuously weathered the storm, no matter what has been tossed their way. Slowly but surely expanding their influence and aiding the efforts of the National Revolution, they have perhaps reached the pinnacle of what they can achieve under the Central Government.\n\nThis is not any more evident than in the affairs of the National Revolutionary Army itself. Again and again, prestigious positions carrying innumerate influence on governmental and military policy are scooped up by New Guangxi and their officers, becoming an increasingly dominant force within the army, practically overriding governmental control. In a further unfortunate turn of events, even unaligned officers in the affairs of the various factions have begun to agree with New Guangxi's line of thinking, and consequently the army has grown to become another weapon of the New Guangxi clique in their aims for control of the nation. Otherwise many not aligned with the clique are shifted into irrelevancy, and hastily all opposition has become increasingly complacent with the situation."
 GXC.midgame.465.a: "The natural course..."
 GXC.midgame.465.b: "Will they ever stop?"

 GXC.midgame.466.t: "The Return of the Crown Prince"
 GXC.midgame.466.d: "In description of the various leading figures of the Kuomintang, one has been quoted as saying: \"If you went to see Hu Hanmin, he spoke so eloquently that you never had a chance to open your mouth. If you went to see Chiang, he listened to you but spoke little. If you went to see Wang Jingwei, he was very courteous and both of you conversed a great deal. If you went to see Sun Fo, neither of you had much to say\". Never has this become more apparent than in the magnanimous return of Dr. Sun's biological son, Sun Fo, to national politics.\n\nHaving fled overseas following the failure of the Northern Expedition, Sun Fo had set up a clique comprised of various western liberals and overseas Chinese nominally known as the \"Hawaii Clique\" - named after their place of exile. As the diminutively known \"Crown Prince\", Sun Fo has connections on both the Left and Right wing of the Kuomintang, and both nominally respect what he has to say. Following the failure of the MinGan Insurgency operations in Fujian, Sun Fo has decidedly made his - and his Reconstruction Faction's - new home to be Guangzhou.\n\nAn eclectic collection of diverse figures, the \"Iron-Necked Liberal\" serves as the face and master of his centrist faction within the Kuomintang, featuring those who could be considered leftists such as Wang Kunlun, figures with national pre-eminence such as the renowned Wu Chaoshu, Hawaii Liberals such as Huang Hanliang, and even their own clique within the National Revolutionary Army known as the \"India Clique\" - featuring Zhang Fakui.\n\nWith this diverse band under his helm, Sun Fo has been able to weave himself into national Kuomintang politics as a force of liberalism in a sea of authoritarian tendencies, and has dedicated himself to ensuring that Tutelage receives its end point."
 GXC.midgame.466.a: "A Centrist Kuomintang?"
 GXC.midgame.466.b: "Watch where you stand, Sun Fo."

 GXC.midgame.467.t: "Against Militarism"
 GXC.midgame.467.d: "Famously known for his opposition to blatant and uncontrolled militarism, Sun Fo has used his faction's rise in popularity to lambaste and rail against military rule, drawing from the slew of warlords born from overambitious and uncontrolled generals along with the Kuomintang's very own Chiang Kai-shek, he has openly decried the influence of the military in governmental matters. Intent on breaking the psychological hold warlordism and militarism has on the people, stating that previous failures in the National Revolution occurred due to the military being unable to win the support of the masses, nor become their guardian. Instead, he believes that the strength of the revolution must come from the masses, for the Revolution to even have a hope of success.\n\nGoing further, he has been quoted as saying \"Military affairs are different from politics. To control the army, one can issue orders from the top ranks to the lower ranks. To govern a nation, however, one cannot use military order\", and has even begun the publication of a series of papers outlining his desire for the cessation of military rule, and the beginning of implementation of the five yuan governmental structure.\n\nNaturally this has drawn much ire from the various army based cliques within the Kuomintang, who question Sun Fo's expertise on military matters seeing as how he has never served nor commanded, and various civilian factions have criticised ending Tutelage too soon, fearing that democracy may be smothered in its crib."
 GXC.midgame.467.a: "No room for militarists!"
 GXC.midgame.467.b: "Somebody shut him up!"

 GXC.midgame.468.t: "Moderates and Extremists"
 GXC.midgame.468.d: "Having its roots in the 1924 Reorganisation of the Kuomintang, the Western Hills Clique can be linked back to the original Tongmenghui, with its more western-style revolutionary orientation carrying a significant mass of various political opinions. Truly however, the clique formally came into existence during the aforementioned Reorganisation, greatly opposing CSP integration. The most outspoken opponents at the time were softly removed post Reorganisation, although most within the clique held their tongues out of deference for Dr. Sun.\n\nWith Sun's death, the nominal members of the Western Hills Clique closed ranks, and formed resolutely in opposition to continued cooperation between the Kuomintang and Chinese Syndicalist Party. Factionalism grew within the clique itself however, as a split emerged between the radical and moderate wings, with the latter seeking rapprochement with Wang Jingwei and the Kuomintang left whilst expelling the CSP. The former won out, nevertheless, and the growing rift between the party's wings led to the titular Western Hills Conference with the intent to be held in Beijing.\n\nWhilst nominally superior in power and influence within the clique, the radicals have accepted the \"moderate extremists\" of the party - such as Ju Zheng and Zhang Ji - into their ranks to create unity within their bloc of the government. Despite their resolve in their opposition to syndicalist influence within the party, the direction of the party is rather aimless as [ROOT.GetLeader] shares their anti CSP sentiment, and therefore their daggers are drawn yet no target is to be seen.\n\nSome within the clique want to shore up their own popularity amongst the revolutionary masses, in an attempt to secure the top position once the nation is united, whilst others desire to play it safe and resolutely put the weight of the clique behind the Chairman, in fears he is supplanted by enemies to both the Elders and Western Hills cliques."
 GXC.midgame.468.a: "To be the vanguard!"
 GXC.midgame.468.b: "We must back the Chairman."

 GXC.midgame.469.t: "Free from the Bindings"
 GXC.midgame.469.d: "Having risen to national prominence in recent times, the Western Hills Clique's role as a minor partner and ally of Hu Hanmin's Elders Clique is no longer as apparent as it seems. Whilst still pertinent to the Chairman's vision for the nation, many within the clique are clambering for them to become an independent force within the party, not requiring the goodwill and patronage of Hu Hanmin to have any impact on Chinese politics. This notwithstanding, the relationship between Hu Hanmin and the Western Hills Clique has been an amicable and steady one, originally forming an alliance due to Western Hills needing a strong leader to fight back against the syndicalist encroachment of the Kuomintang, their bond developed further as both the Elders Clique and Western Hills Clique began to comprise the majority of positions within the exiled Moscow Committee.\n\nNoted for their influences from the late Song Jiaoren's vision for the party and China; a nation in which constitutionalism is enshrined in its core values, and with a strong parliamentary system, the Western Hills Clique and their dynamic with Hu Hanmin seem to perfectly mirror and replicate Song Jiaoren's old personal clashes with his boss Sun Yat-sen, with the clique's leadership comprised of various close friends of the Chairman. In their new prominence, Ju Zheng, Lin Sen and Zou Lu are all struggling to come to terms with the new strength of their group, split between personal loyalties and conviction. Would the clique move towards their own path, striking out? Or continue supporting the Chairman?"

 GXC.midgame.470.t: "Revolutionary Pallor"
 GXC.midgame.470.d: "For the last few couple of days a strange atmosphere surrounds most provincial government buildings in our territory, even in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. They appear eerily desolate and judging by the clerks and officials' faces inside, the air feels freezing, even though the heating and the electricity - where it's available - seems to be in working condition. Our once proud, but now faded banner sways in the light wind, tangling together from time to time, but nobody is there to adjust it - the people of the street pass by it with bowed down heads, perhaps at an even quicker pace then one usually walks with. Obviously they couldn't care less about the flag or our government which promised them a new and fairer China, and failed them - for the second time.\n\nThe widespread cynicism of the population against the Kuomintang has already crept into every part of the functioning of the state. Li Zongren was forced to notice this during a recent military inspection of the Second Army headquarters. It is undeniable that the veteran general did not mind the movement's zeal waning, since it was all limiting Hu Hanmin's influence. But perhaps he has undermined Hu's authority too much? Maybe he should have been slower to build his own vision because now it's just going to collapse before he can do anything? It's hard to say what was going through Li's mind as he listened to the joint briefing of division commanders in a wooden hut, gazing into the distance at a white sun flag slowly fading into the morning fog.\n\nBut Li was not alone in reaching this conclusion. His rival in every sense of the word, Hu Hanmin has also noticed the general scepticism and doubt coming from the population, and not reacting to this very serious warning would be a political shot in the foot. Several populist measures and a campaign plan for the rapid social-political mobilisation of the populace has been drawn up, but it really begs the question if this isn't too little too late."
 GXC.midgame.470.a: "Is this some kind of a curse?"
 GXC.midgame.470.b: "An urgent exorcism is needed!"

 GXC.midgame.471.t: "The Unavoidable Quagmire"
 GXC.midgame.471.d: "As we returned to power something emerged in government circles that clearly shouldn't have - patronage. It is not an unfamiliar phenomenon in KMT circles: it was an intricate part of the KMT's organisation even before the Northern Expedition, and it has put even Chiang Kai-shek in difficult situations on more than one occasion. Unfortunately, unlike many of our comrades, this spectre survived the Northern Expedition and has now returned, with all its problems and significant threats. As our government structure is still far from completely unified, riddled with competing factions and rivalling people, patronage - as the primary method of appointment - became more and more widespread as a tool in this web of conflicts. Although of course Hu Hanmin is still viewed \"personally incorruptible\" the signs of cracks start to show all around him. Numerous recently appointed officials are completely incompetent for their position and they seem to have some rather unique sense of governmental hierarchy. They often consult their patrons instead of their superiors on various matters, top-down directives are regularly lost en route or passed on in a modified form, not only slowing down the various processes but also hampering the day-to-day functioning of the government apparatus.\n\nNeedless to say, this whole system has become the hotbed of corruption that even ordinary people are beginning to notice. Several much needed reform plans were shut down before they could reach their effect, greatly hurting Hu Hanmin's influence in the process. Different warlords, and even Li Zongren greatly profits from the resulting implications and without having to worry about any crackdown - as Hu's hands are tied down if he wants to stay in power - they can continue to plot their intricate schemes."

 GXC.midgame.472.t: "A Loyal Opposition"
 GXC.midgame.472.d: "Increasingly critical voices of Hu Hanmin and his circle of dominant figures in the Kuomintang are are popping up more and more often. The main points of criticism are the widespread corruption and high taxes, not necessarily unrelated to each other. One surprising fact is that the one of the main criticism came not from Li Zongren, who is openly antagonistic to the chairman, but from two senior figures in the Western Hills clique, Lin Sen and Ju Zheng. They argue that poor governance and corruption are the inherent evils of the early period but we must not overlook these problems. Both are actually loyal supporters of Hu, so it's quite a twist, but it's not necessarily a betrayal, rather perhaps a sign that Hu Hanmin's influence is not as widespread in the Kuomintang as he is trying to show to the wider party.\n\nAs we march everyday forward towards our goal of unified China, it's clear we can't and we won't reach it without the necessary sacrifices. But we have to be careful: If we throw away too much of our dream, the foundation of the people's faith in us, we won't be true to ourselves any more and be destined to fall."
 GXC.midgame.472.a: "Only time will tell."
 GXC.midgame.472.b: "The white sun will fly over China!"

 GXC.midgame.473.t: "The Party and the Army"
 GXC.midgame.473.d: "A recent hearing on military budget was unexpectedly quite eventful. Hu Hanmin's relentless questions about the military's overspending put Bai Chongxi, Li Zongren's lieutenant and de facto aide de camp, in a rather awkward position, to the extent that Li himself had to intervene to get him out of the predicament. The chairman has always been sceptical about militarism and the army and has never seen it as a state-leading element. Ideally, he believes, civilians should manage the day-to-day affairs of the party and the state. As the separation of these roles is currently not clear enough, there is constant conflict which is more or less visible to the public, but this hearing clearly showed Hu Hanmin's strengthened position and influence within the KMT.\n\nAs the party grows more powerful and energetic day by day we shouldn't forget the ordinary people who rally to our flag. Their faith in the Kuomintang revolution is everything to us and without their support our vision will crumble. We can't let our sacrifices be in vain!"
 GXC.midgame.473.a: "The army is the only way for us see unification."
 GXC.midgame.473.b: "The party is what allows us to see beyond it."

 GXC.midgame.474.t: "A Splintering Movement"
 GXC.midgame.474.d: "The fruits of Hu Hanmin's and the Kuomintang's tireless efforts are clearly paying off. Our banner flies prideful not only in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] but also in many other cities in South China and proudly heralds the triumphs of our movement. The general mood among the common people is quite enthusiastic, and it would appear that our envisioned new China is no longer a question of if but when.\n\nHowever, the current situation is not without its problems. Perhaps out of over-enthusiasm, building on our past achievements, more and more voices are calling for various reforms, from within and outside government. This has put our leadership in a very difficult position because these reforms are in most cases quite a bit more radical than what our current vision would allow, therefore these voices are left unsatisfied. In turn this has resulted in a wilful population that is difficult to control, the most typical manifestation of which is the emergence of several self-organising revolutionary circles. These organisations are completely local, separate from each other and all believe and trust in the party, but it is questionable whether, if the trend of the growth of our revolutionary zeal continues, they won't give us more headaches.\n\nAnother downside is that it's getting harder and harder to get cooperation from the high command of the army. They, led by Li Zongren, are increasingly sceptical about this growth of zealousness, but there's not much they can actually do about it, outside of the structure of the military where several reorganisations are to be expected in the coming weeks."

 GXC.midgame.474.b: "We must hold ourselves together!"

 GXC.midgame.475.t: "Apex of the Revolution"
 GXC.midgame.475.d: "In recent subcommittee meetings on more than a few occasions, Hu Hanmin and several other senior members were shouted down by the other members, which quickly resulted these meetings turning into a screaming match between the more radical camps. But Hu couldn't be heard anywhere. The ageing chairman's principled voice that once permeated the whole room is increasingly absent from these meetings. On the political councils he also prefers - rather uncharacteristically - to sit quietly, without criticising others or speaking ill of them, one would might think he doesn't care what happens there, but this couldn't be further from the truth. For several days now, he's been obsessing over the problem of excessive zeal within the party. Due to the extreme revolutionary energy, the Kuomintang has started to fragment and is showing signs of collapsing under its own weight. It is now difficult to define the course or to control the various local branches of the party mainly due to the self-organising revolutionary circles that are not following the party line in the strict sense and standing outside the party. There are already reports of local incidents where fellow party members lynched each other over ideological differences or patrolled the streets in groups to seek out individuals they perceived as not sympathetic to the KMT.\n\nHu Hanmin is now facing the enormous task of reigning in something that should never have been let out of control, and there will be a high price to pay for it. But he has to do something about it and do it fast, before the fires of revolutionary zeal consume from within all that we have achieved with blood and sweat in the past."

 GXC.midgame.498.d: "At long last, Beijing has fallen to advancing Kuomintang forces. The capital of the Great Qing and the citadel of Yuan Shikai and his Beiyang descendants, it has long been the dream of their southern government rivals to capture the city. [ROOT.GetLeader] was quick to editorialise the moment, opening with a speech discussing the significance of the city. He then moved on to a more pressing plea:\n\n\"...the sole mission of the Nationalist Government is to obey the command of the Kuomintang and complete the National Revolution advocated by Dr. Sun. The Kuomintang was established by the Eternal Premier himself, no one shall capsize or destroy it. The Three Principles of the People was founded by the Premier himself; no one shall twist or overwhelm it. We should complete the National Revolution under the Premier's Kuomintang and Three Principles of the People, doing so is to fulfil the unfulfilled wishes of the Premier. Now, the society has not yet understood the true nature of the Kuomintang, its ideology and its revolutionary policies. The revolutionary policies of the KMT were all born from the Premier's Three People's Principles. Policies that are not born from the Premier's Three People's Principles are counter-revolutionary policies; a Party that is not based on the Three People's Principles would not be the Kuomintang... If we include what had never been said by the Premier as the Premier's policies, then we would be traitors to him. We must first establish this criterion so that we can identify who is a follower of the Premier and who is a traitor.\"\n\nHe concludes with words warning the party to not grow complacent and to be on alert for subversion from within. With the fall of Beijing the eyes of the world are now on the KMT as many wonder what happens next. The economy is in shambles, and concerning reports of significant difficulties emerging from the newly victorious army flow in. But regardless it is clear that a new day is dawning on China."

 GXC.midgame.499.d: "When the subject of Japan came up, Hu Hanmin often likes to relay the prophetic words he attributes to Dr. Sun himself: \"it is indeed unbearable when our territories are occupied and when we are humiliated by a friend. But it is more than unbearable when the younger brother, instead of cooperating with the elder brother, has occupied this territories and has humiliated him.\"\n\nA great battle looms over the horizon. More menacing than our battles with the warlords. More threatening than our wars with Beiyang. More impactful than the ones we have had within our party. Indeed, the Japanese Empire, once seen as a beloved younger brother to the Chinese people, has decided to make war on us, the scorching rays of the Rising Sun daring anyone to challenge them. Already the bombs have begun to fall and guns ring out while bayonets glean.\n\nThis is a conflict we have long known was inevitable, despite noble efforts by a few good men on both sides to avoid it. It will not only decide the fate of the Chinese people, but all peoples across Asia. While the White Sun stands for the true liberation of the continent from the chains of colonialism, the Red Sun shines for a cruel mockery of Pan-Asianism - trading European imperialism for an Asian one.\n\nThis is not a war we wanted. The Japanese made their choice decades ago when they first marched down the path of war. But there is no choice for us. We will either prevail against great odds, mobilising the power of the peoples across the land for a titanic struggle and free them from Japanese aggression. Or we will die glorious martyrs in their defence."

 GXC.midgame.500.t: "The Second National Congress"
 GXC.midgame.500.d: "Thanks to the recent developments, an emergency Kuomintang National Party Congress has been called in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Despite the short notice, key luminaries have flooded in from across the nation, perhaps recognising the urgency of the situation. That is not to say the Congress is perfectly representative, and indeed unification remains distant. But for all its flaws, there is no going back.\n\nHu Hanmin is the opening speaker, and he elects to follow up his prior warnings of corruption within the party by recounting its history, detailing how Chen Jiongming's 1922 betrayal, the 1924 Merchant Corps Uprising, the defection of Yang Ximin and Liu Zhenhuan in 1925, and finally the socialist betrayal at the Fourth Plenum each sabotaged prior attempts at unifying the country. He argues that the syndicalists are particularly condemnable because while Chen, Yang, and Liu openly rebelled, the trans-party elements broke the party from within. It was their trick to fabricate demagogic slogans such as \"Leftist\", \"Rightist\", \"New Leftist\", \"New Rightist\" and impose them on the Kuomintang to break their camaraderie. \"Therefore\", he concludes ominously, \"each time the revolutionary strength grows, we must launch an internal purge. Each time we launch an internal purge, the revolutionary strength of the Kuomintang, will achieve victory over our external counter-revolutionary enemies of warlords, imperialists, and bureaucrats alike!\"\n\nNational party congresses are supposed to be held every four years, though in practice have been suspended. This might very well be the last chance for the various Kuomintang grandees to address the entire party before unification, and they are well aware of this fact. Observers have been desperately trying to read the barometers to get a sense of prevailing attitudes as the leading heirs of Dr. Sun decide the party's direction. Some wonder if this Congress will be the end of the Kuomintang's political struggles...or perhaps only the beginning."

He has also emerged as a respected member of the \"Shanghai Committeemen\", a clique of Central Executive Committee members frequently at odds with their warlord counterparts.\n\nAfter just a few short days, Sun has grown more confident in unveiling their plan for the Conference. Finally, today he has presented the \"Draft Programme of National Salvation\", the first working paper to reveal itself to the public. In it, he and the other authors (many of whom are fellow civilians) came down against further militarisation, demanding that 50% of all government revenues go to reconstruction. He has charged that the high military spending was a necessary evil during the wars of unification, but now that those have slowed the party must begin its transition to helping the people lest it falls to the corruption Beiyang succumbed to before them.\n\nDespite an initially timid start, as he spoke he seemed to energise himself, speaking with alacrity before the assembled intellectuals he hoped to sway. Despite the favourable base, many hesitate to endorse his plan. While many in the audience (and most definitely Sun himself, who sits on the Reconstruction Committee) stand to benefit from an expansion of reconstruction spending, the decline in domestic fighting is clearly more due to the rising threat of Japan. Sun seems to be aloof to this fact (deliberately or not), but his eyes scan the crowd to see if his pleas not to forget his father's hopeful promises to the people fall on deaf ears."

 GXC.midgame.502.d_body: "the Guangxi Reconstruction Research Committee has decided present their findings publicly with Li Zongren's proud backing. The committee was established by the New Guangxi clique to organise a plan for wartime reconstruction and gather post-war reconstruction ideas as well, envisioned as a high level incubator of ideas.\n\nTheir ideas heavily emphasise the need to prepare the nation mentally for war through heavy doses of propaganda in school civics classes, speeches by magistrates, featuring of propaganda films, and solicitation of public support for the troops. The committee has also stressed the need to improve and maintain morale among the conscripts by treating them well (as opposed to the regular abuse most Chinese armies have been built on), providing them quickly with food, drink, blankets, uniforms, and mosquito nets as well as friendly veteran officers. Officers have been advised to scout ahead to prepare clean camp grounds, limiting marches to at most 70 li a day.\n\nOn the flip side, they have recommended aggressive measures against desertion, discouraging them with arrests and harsh punishments. The traditional penalty of imprisoning a family members for a month was deemed inadequate, though the practice of allowing conscripts to pay for a replacement should be allowed to continue. Additional funding has been requested for these measures on top of further initiatives to expand military production and training.\n\nDespite their humble and sometimes crude warlord heritage, the New Guangxi Clique has proven quite adept at politics themselves. They have been working to impress others in the military brass with these plans, working to present themselves as the proud defenders of the nation. While it is unclear if their the decision to share this plan was a hasty response to their rivals in the Shanghai Committee, what is clear is that Li Zongren has been happy to soak up the spotlight. It is clear that his ambitions have grown far beyond that of Guangxi, though the austere nature of his agenda has worried many."

 GXC.midgame.503.t: "Fate of the United Front"
 GXC.midgame.503.d: "Despite talks of reconciliation and compromise, the left wing of the party has largely felt marginalised in the right dominated Kuomintang structure. Most decisions are made behind the scenes before Central Committee meetings, and plenty are not even discussed in Central Committee meetings. Hu Hanmin, long a bitter rival of Wang Jingwei and Liao Zhongkai, has shown little but disdain for the left, doing the bare minimum needed to show party unity.\n\nWhile Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Chen Jitang and other warlords have often been violently anti-socialist and repressive, the civilian right have always drawn a special ire from the left. The Western Hills clique because of their stubborn opposition to any alliance with Syndicalist powers, and the Reconstruction Faction for their weak-willed nature and self-serving efforts at \"compromise\". But worst of all is Hu Hanmin, a true and undisputable revolutionary well read on Sunism, Marxism, and anarchism - who despite this has decided to betray the socialist nature of the revolution for petty power.\n\nBut as the tides begin to shift within the party and Hu's position feels increasingly besieged by his ostensible allies with Sun and Li pulling in drastically different directions, the left has gleefully taken the opportunity to break out of their exclusion and reclaim some influence in party discourse for themselves. In various speeches, the different figures of the old party both present at the Congress and in exile have lambasted the failures of the right to both defend the nation from imperialism or provide the social reforms, and economic relief the party was supposed to. In other words, the party under Hu Hanmin's leadership have failed to live up to the Three Principles.\n\nThat said, even the most die-hard leftist realises by now they cannot directly usurp control of the party by this point, though with the situation being as volatile as it is their combined influence can readily alter the trajectory of the conference. The only question is whether or not it matters more for them to begrudgingly support Sun Fo and his stolen, watered-down policies or to finally secure their revenge against Hu Hanmin and expose his hypocrisies."

 GXC.midgame.504.t: "The Headmaster's Ghost"
 GXC.midgame.504.d: "The legacy of the storied Whampoa Military Academy is a complicated one. Founded by Sun Yat-sen and many leading party figures including Hu Hanmin, Wang Jingwei, Liao Zhongkai, Dai Jitao, among others as a means of creating an army purely loyal to the party-state (as opposed to the fickle loyalties of warlord armies), it quickly began to develop an independent identity of its own. Military men with political ambitions like Chiang Kai-shek, Deng Yanda, and Zhou Enlai began to carve out their own power-base within the school, binding the radical zeal of the cadets to their cults of personality through complex chains of loyalty, mentorship, and fraternity.\n\nWhile plenty can be said about the leftists of the academy, an iconic fixture of the academy's contemporary legacy is its role in spawning the Kuomintang's far right branch. The product of Chiang's tutelage, this \"Whampoa Clique\" is now led by He Yingqin, another instructor and leading Chiang deputy. Staunchly radicalised by years of war and embracing a \"stabbed in the back\" mentality with regards to the civilian leadership of the party and the failed Northern Expedition, many prefer the party trend towards heavy militarisation.\n\nThat said, when it comes to the brewing power-struggle in the party, many have complicated feelings towards Hu and Li. When the shattered remnants of the NRA retreated to their bases in Guizhou, Li Zongren and his Seventh Army fought and lived side by side with He Yingqin and his First Army. This camaraderie was stained by continued rivalries between the cliques. Indeed, many Whampoa officers conceitedly see themselves as better than the petty warlords. Some smaller factions, led by men like Chen Cheng and Zhang Qun, even prefer a reconstruction focus and Chen in particular has written disparagingly about Li's militia system.\n\nAs the days go on, the spirit of Chiang Kai-shek continues to haunt the conference the way he once did as a third, \"centrist\" triumvir between Hu and Wang. Both Li Zongren and Hu Hanmin were leading suspects in Chiang's murder during the Long March, complicating their respective partisans' efforts to court Whampoa's fractured cliques. With many leading generals demurring, it seems that there will not be any formal final decision, rather many smaller ones made by the hearts of individual soldiers."

Hu and his elders, too small to be powerful on their own right, has often depended on the civilian Western Hills clique and the warlord New Guangdong clique to be their pillars of support. The latter has always been a source of embarrassment to Hu, an easy target for accusations of hypocrisy and a source of derision from potential liberal allies. Now, with Hu's position besieged by General Li and the Chairman hoping to add another foot to the stool by courting Sun Fo, his existing allies in Guangzhou have proven more reluctant to come to his defence.\n\nNevertheless, there is no love lost between the Guangdong and Guangxi cliques. Their intertwined history has forced a large degree of cooperation, but also mutual abuse - both had invaded and occupied one another across the warlord period. Relations between Chen Jitang and Li Zongren are polite but frosty; both share a common desire for their own province's autonomy while preserving the nation's strength, heavy militarism and social engineering, and a certain disdain for pompous intellectuals. Amid the uncertainty and conflicting promises, it is up to Chen Jitang, \"the Heavenly King of the South\", to read the situation to his advantage."

 GXC.midgame.506.d: "The Western Hills clique since its inception has always seen Hu Hanmin as the rightful leader of the party, though such loyalty is not unconditional either. Hu's leadership has always been contingent on his ability to defend the party from the infiltration of the syndicalist powers and the subversion of the warlords, and Li's ascent has raised questions among his allies about Hu's ability to fulfil his mandate to bring constitutional rule to China. While the leaders of the Western Hills faction are willing to fight for him, few are willing to sink with him.\n\nThus, the once lofty and steadfast bastion of the Chairman has begun to quiver, their supercilious tone turning to a skittish one. While few buy Li's claim to have embraced democratic principles, some figures such as Huang Zhilu, Xie Chi and Mao Zuquan have begun to show some sympathy for the general's call for a resolute defence while facing down Japanese aggression. Others such as Ju Zheng and Zou Lu however have shown nothing but contempt for warlord insubordination, calling on the caucus to rally to Hu Hanmin's defence. In the centre sits men like Lin Sen, Li Liejun and Zhang Ji, who have shuttled back and forth trying to mediate between the warring sides of the right. Prioritising unity, they have also begun to quietly evaluate the situation for themselves.\n\nWith room for a amicable resolution narrowing, the right Kuomintang's \"mountain\" is said to have turned inwards, its top leaders meeting in a closed session in a private conference room after meditation at a nearby temple. Their deliberations have run long into the night, but their final decision will have a significant effect on the rank and file."

On the eve of the National Congress being called to order, the Central Executive Committee has decided to meet one final time before a new CEC is inaugurated.\n\nNormally a procedural matter, it was quickly apparent that this would be no \"lame duck\" session. In an effort to assert his unquestioned authority, Hu Hanmin began proceedings with a taut but vivacious speech defending his track record and maintaining that the revolution is well on track for unification. He stressed his role as Dr. Sun's successor and the need for a united face by the Central Executive Committee in accordance with the democratic centralist principles the party was founded on, warning of the dangers intra-party discord presents."

 GXC.midgame.508.d: "Despite the barrage of attacks that befell him, Hu Hanmin stood his ground and turned the tables against his warlord rival. After a tight but still commanding vote, Hu Hanmin emerged stronger than before and with the support of the National Congress ensured the new Central Executive Committee was stacked with loyalists. Other committees will soon follow suit.\n\nIn a party known for bitter revenge against dissenters, failed challengers often face a grim fate - quickly abandoned by their allies. Like a house of cards, Li's bloc collapsed, with latecomers quickly returning to the safety of their previous cliques while denying any involvement in Li's schemes. Within hours, only the bravest few were willing to be associated with the now disgraced General Li.\n\nNews of his failed gambit quickly reached Guangxi. Governor Huang Shaohong, one of his chief allies and the nominal head of the province, has disavowed any knowledge of Li's plot and has personally called Hu Hanmin to assure him of the province's loyalty - going so far as to declare Li a persona non grata. Huang Xuchu in turn is said to have been detained by the Guangxi delegation in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] for \"suspected corruption\".\n\nLi Zongren has accepted his fate stoically, sitting taciturnly in discussions in proper Guangxi military fashion. Bai Chongxi has remained at his side, has shown no sign of ordering any military movements that might constitute a rebellion. The only act that could be construed as a plea of mercy was a brief statement by Li of his desire to humbly continue to serve the revolution in the way the Chairman sees fit.\n\nWhile their actions are not sufficient to cast them out of the party, the Chairman must ensure they do not rise again. War Minister Xu Chongzhi and General Chen Jitang has suggested ordering them to distant military posts - placing Li as Director of the Military Affairs Commission Headquarters (a powerless position near the frontline) and Bai as a \"Special Advisor to the War Minister\" in the capital, thus keeping them far apart from one another and Guangxi. Li Wenfan (Hu's protégé) and Foreign Minister Wu Chaoshu have instead advised both be sent abroad, perhaps to Moscow and Constantinople, as \"military attaches\" - a tried and true method of eliminating rivals."

After a slim but still decisive vote, Hu Hanmin was finished - failing to garner enough support for another term. Rather than wait and seek an appointment for an honorary (and likely powerless) position, Hu instead resigned in disgrace from all positions he held in the party.\n\nLin Sen, a venerable and respected leader of the Western Hills clique, was inaugurated as the new Chairman as part of a broader compromise brokered between the warring Kuomintang factions. The acrimony in the room was so bitter that Hu hardly looked his successor in the eyes during the hand off, giving a terse statement and briefly shaking hands while refusing to acknowledge Li Zongren's role in events at all.\n\nHu's lack of sportsmanship hardly seemed to faze Li, who quickly sprang into action. As the list of military appointments were read, it was increasingly obvious who the true winner of the night was: Li Zongren was sworn in as Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, Huang Xuchu selected as War Minister, and Bai Chongxi appointed as Headmaster of Whampoa and Chief of Staff of the General Staff Headquarters. Li was also bequeathed the title of Generalissimo, an honour not seen since the old days of Sun Yat-sen's Guangzhou Military Headquarters.\n\nOther leading military appointments have been distributed as spoils to the New Guangxi clique and their protégés, squeezing out many rival military cliques for coveted positions. This brazen power-grab seems to have alienated General Chen Jitang and the New Guangdong Clique, who have been seen seething at the news: it is apparent that they were promised far more for their defection than materialised. This encapsulates a long week of betrayals as new battlelines are drawn. While the New Guangxi Clique toast to their new found hegemony over the army, the Western Hills clique desperately guard the civilian government from any further encroachment.

Legally meant to be held on a regular basis, these Congresses have largely been an impromptu affair for the duration of national liberation. As major regional leaders, the areas under our control have been allocated delegates on a per county basis. With delegates representing all provinces in China in attendance, this is a rare chance for policymakers to have their opinions heard before the entire nation, or at least the parts under Kuomintang rule.\n\nTaking advantage of this opportunity include the so-called \"Shanghai Committeemen\", a coalition of factions led by Sun Fo (the only son of revered party founder Sun Yat-sen) who has proposed an ambitious economic national reconstruction programme, including a commitment of 50% of all government revenues towards civilian purposes. This \"Draft Programme of National Salvation\" has met its challenge by the rival Guangxi Reconstruction Research Committee, which at the behest of Li Zongren has proposed a drastic further militarisation of society along party lines.\n\nHu Hanmin, the current Chairman, facing a revolt from both the civilian-intellectual and military-warlord wings of the party has scrambled to defuse the situation, though preliminary discussions indicate that he has sought to shore up support from Sun Fo and the Shanghai Committee. Indeed, the competing visions for the future of the revolution has become a greater proxy battle for the fate of Chairman Hu's leadership as he seeks a mandate to finish the national liberation.\n\nPartisans from both factions have pulled our men aside hoping to solicit their support.

The Chairman and his allies have consolidated their position, launching a swift counterattack to remove any remaining doubters from office in central government controlled territories. Thankfully, the purge has largely spared outlying provinces like our own, but it is a reminder of the perils that the losers of China's dangerous power games face. As for the Nationalist Government, it seems that they will be pursuing a more civilian-dominated direction, though with his last minute agreement with the \"Shanghai Committeemen\" of Sun Fo's ilk and the enduring support of the Western Hills Clique under Ju Zheng being so visibly instrumental in Hu's political survival, it is obvious he is not out of the woods quite yet."

 GXC.midgame.520.d: "With our successful conquest of China's eastern seaboard, the right wing of the Kuomintang has re-established itself as the dominant faction of the party. The rejuvenation of our fortunes has come at the expense of the old party left, which has been shattered into its component factions, undone both by our victories, their defeats, and the incessant infighting of Chinese socialists.\n\nWhatever the case, the stalling out of leftist momentum has created a void in the Chinese republican scene. The leftist central committee has long prided themselves in being the \"civilian wing of the party\", conveniently ignoring the Moscow Committee's own civilian roots. Sun Fo and his Reconstruction Faction have seen a surge in energy as they work to capitalise on the demise of their old allies, coaxing many moderates into their camp with promises of amnesty or even jobs in our government.\n\nWhile few had any objections to inviting Sun Fo into our government, many of these concessions were not his to give, and many in turn find it irksome that he acts as if it is - no doubt an effort to shore up his ambitions of taking control of the party as a compromise between right and left. His most immediate appeals to the central committee are a selection of centre-left military commanders broadly aligned with his vision - most prominently Li Jishen, a long-time Kuomintang-aligned Cantonese warlord who found himself aligned with the left. He and others' slated for a pardon by Sun's lobbying are many former leaders of the old Guangdong-based Fourth Army of the National Revolutionary Army, strengthening their candidacy in the perennially southern-based movement."

Hu's condemnation of Wang and his Internationale backers has been unequivocal: writing while in exile that \"The Union of Britain is a proletarian dictatorship in name but in reality it is a dictatorship of the Labour Party; it is a dictatorship of the Labour Party in name but in reality a dictatorship of Mann and his faction.\", while acidly categorising French syndicalism as rudderless and on the verge of total social breakdown.\n\nSun Fo, posturing himself as a mediator despite his own relatively recent defection, has sought to wedge his faction as a bastion of compromise between the warring cliques. Besides the usual platitudes, Sun Fo has impressed on the Chairman a more practical motivation: the need to reassure progressive supporters of the Kuomintang's commitment to civilian rule and eventual democracy. While few moderates are upset that the socialists were unsuccessful in their quixotic quest to bring violent class struggle to China, many are worried about the encroachment of military men in our party's ranks and would like to see a compromise.\n\nWang Jingwei for his part has been quick to pivot after his defeat, a testament to his flexibility and will to survive as a politician. Presenting himself as a left nationalist and a democrat, he has leaned on his previously peripheral and primarily intellectual \"Moderate\" wing of the Reorganised Comrades Association (RCA) of the Kuomintang, distancing himself from the Marxist rhetoric of the \"Radical\" RCA. In doing so he has alienated himself with the extremists, costing himself his previously largely unquestioned leadership over the left, though with their chances of independently securing China effectively moribund this gamble may be his last chance for relevance."

 GXC.midgame.522.d: "When the Northern Expedition collapsed, the survivors of the disastrous battle of Jinhua went underground. They became the core of a major insurgency in China's eastern seaboard, culminating in the failed 1932 Shanghai Uprising. Undeterred, Song Qingling (widow of the late Sun Yat-sen) and General Deng Yanda reorganised their loyalists into the Provisional Action Committee of the Kuomintang (PAC), continuing resistance in the Jiangxi-Fujian zone despite pressure from the League's increasingly successful \"Encirclement Campaigns.\"\n\nTheir uprising during the League War seems to have been their last hurrah: whatever successes they may have achieved they are now mostly a spent force. Unlike Wang, they are noted for their strong ideological commitment, frequently denouncing us and Wang (who they blame for the left's failure) as \"false revolutionaries.\" Despite their apparent inflexibility, some in their camp like Chen Youren and Song Ziwen have expressed willingness to broker an agreement, working through intermediaries in hopes of a deal.\n\nSun Fo, as usual, has been eager to play the part of the \"honest broker\", though has taken a slightly different angle while making his case: he argues that MinGan's commanders are a necessary counterbalance to forestall a coup. Marshal Li Liejun has brought forward the earnest convictions of men like Deng Yanda, and how he has continued to champion the Kuomintang's cause, in his own way.\n\nGeneral Bai Chongxi has come down harshly against the agrarian populists of the PAC, arguing that China remains in a pre-capitalist stage of development and that he wished to develop a socialist society without undergoing the turmoil associated with capitalism. Instead, he argues that Sanmin provides simultaneous political, national and economic revolution that bypasses the need for socialism. China's battle then is one of national, not class struggle, and while imperialism must be stopped through force, peace is the only way to overcome poverty."

 GXC.midgame.523.t: "The World Society and the Anarchist Paradox"
 GXC.midgame.523.d: "Syndicalism is a broad global movement, but has found a niche even in the largely agrarian Chinese socialist scene. While broadly condemned across the right, serving as the raison d'etre of the Western Hills Clique and the eventual split in the party, Hu Hanmin personally has shown some sympathy to the more libertarian, utopian elements of the movement and was one of the last rightists to break from the Reorganisation. Indeed, for their party, some of the leaders of the Western Hills Conference have claimed that they were willing to continue the United Front with the League of Chinese Syndicalists, but were unwilling to endorse allowing LCS members to hold Kuomintang membership.\n\nBefore the CSP was formed and then created the LCS, the anarchist World Society was briefly the dominant faction of the socialist scene. Their leadership included high ranking members of the Kuomintang, most prominent being the \"Four Elders\" Zhang Renjie, Wu Zhihui, Cai Yuanpei, and Li Shizeng, French educated anarchist intellectuals who have grown bitterly opposed to the CSP. Hu Hanmin has expressed sympathy for these men, and has floated the possibility of rehabilitating the World Society. This has also attracted some support from the \"Tokyo branch\" of the Chinese anarchist movement, including Western Hills Clique grandee Zhang Ji (himself a former contributor to World Society publications), who often argued in their \"Natural Justice\" publication that Chinese Confucianism and Daoism has made China much more receptive to anarchism by protecting it from imperial overreach.\n\nStill, many conservatives are sceptical. Li Zongren has been quick to speak on their behalf, invoking his deep-seated peasant conservative background and expressing \"moral outrage\" and the loose, degenerate lifestyles of syndicalist intellectuals. While Hu and others may see anarchism as an idealistic end state, Li and cynics believe it to be nothing more than an absurd fantasy."

 GXC.midgame.524.t: "The Untameable Revolution"
 GXC.midgame.524.d: "For all their faults, the Kuomintang's left has never been bereft of fanatical men willing to sacrifice everything for the national cause, something that has attracted pity, disgust, and sometimes even fascination from the right. The greatest manifestation of Whampoa zealotry is the Chinese Reconstruction Society (CRS), a faction of ultranationalist staff, alumni, and graduates who have further radicalised during their exile abroad.\n\nDespite their frothing xenophobia, many eagerly embraced European doctrinal developments and weapons, integrating it with their own militant blend of Bushido, party dogma, and Whampoa fraternity. Their radicalism has put off most, even the usually overly trusting Reconstruction Faction, from pursuing any reconciliation with them. However, in an odd twist of events, Li Zongren has expressed some sympathy for their methods, noting his admiration for both the Russians and the Syndicalists' ability to mobilise the masses, including their \"guerilla style propagandists\" who were willing to go to great lengths to enlist the support of their entire nations.\n\nThe CRS leadership, particularly their more pragmatic leader General Hu Zongnan, has expressed some willingness to join our government in our mutual quest to drive out foreign invaders and complete the Kuomintang revolution. However, Hu Hanmin is reluctant to become another Kerensky - caught between rightist and leftist extremists using one another as a justification to undermine the government. Few would blame him for rejecting the CRS offer, yet the temptation always remains."

 GXC.midgame.530.t: "Legacy of a Generalissimo"
 GXC.midgame.530.d: "Not all branches of the Revolutionary Party have retained a sense of loyalty towards the derisively named \"Moscow Committee\" of Hu Hanmin. Most glaringly, the left wing of the party, owing loyalty either to those in the MinGan struggle, or those within Wang Jingwei's Parisian Central Executive Committee. However, the right wing itself is neither united nor whole, considering the emergence of the \"New Right\" that sprouted from the ideological doctrine of Dai Jitao, one of the Guofu's most close aides and secretaries. Capturing the young and radical members of the party by storm, he has managed to integrate himself with the rather ideologically pragmatic He Yingqin, heir to the late Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and his \"Whampoa\" Clique of the National Revolutionary Army.\n\nHaving occupied Guizhou through force and wit for almost a decade, the Kuomintang within Guizhou are not entirely staffed by those of the New Right, as there are plenty of loyalists that remained faithful to the exiled Central Executive Committee. Chief among them being that of Zhu Peide and his 3rd Army of the NRA, who ruled as the primary figure in the region overseeing his 5-man Junta of the interwar. With Li Zongren and the 7th NRA entering Guangxi, and the subsequent occupation of Guizhou by our forces, there have been many discussions as to the fate of the Rightist Guerrillas.\n\nProponents of integration of the disparate party insist upon good faith, shows of party unity, and the necessary skillsets provided by the elite of the NRA. Opponents, chief amongst them old rivals of the \"New Right\" such as those in the Elders, Western Hills, and Reconstruction factions oppose opening the door to those deemed some of the most dangerous to their power within the party's politics."

 GXC.midgame.531.t: "Matchstick of Revolution"
 GXC.midgame.531.d: "The province that initiated the ultimately doomed Northern Expedition has long been one home to much strife, suffering, and warfare during the Warlord Era. Ripe with conditions to foment its own regionalist Kuomintang party members, the party cadres from Hunan have been some of its most loyal, and some of its most mixed. Stalwarts of the party such as Cheng Qian, who has long endured the path of revolutionary struggle, or the amiable Tan Yankai, one of Dr. Sun's most reliable allies, owe the province their allegiance. Similarly, radical firebrands based within the agrarian province's rural populace, such as Tang Shengzhi, have proven to be the backbone of the Leftist faction's own struggle.\n\nAnd so the question is raised, with the occupation of Changsha and practical dominion over Hunan Province, what shall be the fate of the local party members? The leftwing notwithstanding, many of the younger party cadres, and especially the New Guangxi Clique, have opposed any and all considerations of true amnesty to the Hunan Kuomintang. Insisting that their time has passed, or otherwise that they are a spent force willing to parley with Beiyang.\n\nIn opposition, much of the older party membership, such as Western Hills, or the Elders, have opened communication channels with Cheng Qian and his 6th Army, alongside Tan Yankai and his 2nd. Feasibly vouching of their continued loyalty to the ideals of the National Revolution, and their relative apolitical attitude in inter-party affairs, their calls for integration have rung true throughout much of the neutral party membership. Yet concerns of enabling Old Guard domination of the party apparatus remain, championed most fiercely by Li Zongren and Chen Jitang."

 GXC.midgame.532.t: "The Estranged Northerners"
 GXC.midgame.532.d: "A most curious political development during the Warlord Era is that of the emergence of the Guominjun. Originally a faction within the Zhili Clique loyal to Feng Yuxiang, they would slowly chart their own course of mass-peasant populism, even if particularly heavy-handed. Betraying the Zhili in the Second Zhili-Fengtian War, the Guominjun managed to even seize Beijing. However, with a coalition built against them by the Beiyang warlords, they would be beaten back.\n\nRetreating to the Northwest, Feng Yuxiang would resign briefly, and they would lose the loyalty of the Ma Families in their own rebellion. Detested by the local Mongols, and unable to break out of the region, they would enter into an uneasy agreement and alliance with Yan Xishan for the duration of the interwar. Having exchanged positive affirmations of the KMT, Feng would take the Wuyuan Oath, proclaiming loyalty to Sanminzhuyi, and the Party. Albeit unable to stop the failure of the Northern Expedition, he has continued to champion what little aspects of the Kuomintang remain within the North.\n\nHaving occupied their homebase of Shaanxi, the Guominjun have come out in droves, bearing white flags and offers of sincere dedication and loyalty to the party, nation, and army. Many of those pessimistic and skeptical within the party have called into question Feng Yuxiang's sincerity in his proclamations, considering his tendency to betray allies at a moment's notice, or even accusing him of being an ally of the left. Others, more optimistic, or otherwise already attached to the GMJ, such as Yu Youren or the Western Hills Clique, have insisted upon their revolutionary dedication. Late converts as they may be, they championed the revolution in their own way, and fought their own revolutionary struggle arm-in-arm with the masses. Many have even brought up their role with hosting the Western Hills Conference, the Inner Mongolian Kuomintang, or their work with Political Science, as proof of their merits."

 ##LKMT Satellite Narrative (540-559)
 GXC.midgame.540.t: "The Organic Law of Guangdong"
 GXC.midgame.540.d: "In the weeks following Chen Mingshu's coup, the leftists of Guangdong have felt free to come out of the woodwork, consolidating their new found power through the \"Organic Law of the Guangdong Provincial Government\". This bill, passed unanimously by gathered delegates, aims to simplify provincial administration by removing the prefecture level of government and distributing its responsibilities to the provincial and county governments. At the helm sits the Guangdong Provincial Government Committee consisting of eleven members drawn from different departments, with five of them acting as a standing committee.\n\nNaturally, Chen Mingshu has been named Governor of Guangdong (translator's note: formally, the Kuomintang uses the title of Chairman rather than Governor, but to prevent overcomplication we will use \"Governor\"), leveraging his control of the army. Tan Pingshan has been named Secretary-General of the Provincial Administration, allying with local unions that control much of the city. Peng Pai has been recognised as Secretary of the Guangdong Farmer's Association to appease rural militias roaming the countryside. Rounding out the standing committee are two officials sent south from [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Liang Hancao, a former Wang Jingwei secretary and now a close protégé of Sun Fo, has been named Party Secretary of Guangzhou and Chen Yaozu (Wang Jingwei's brother-in-law) has been appointed Mayor. Evidently, the central government continues to take special interest in the city.\n\nThere continues to be much debate over how long this arrangement can last. The leading members of the Guangdong government have little in common now that Chen Jitang is gone. To the west, Li Zongren and the New Guangxi clique jealously guard their power. They will have to act fast however; the reactionaries remain antsy, the central government expects results, and the people demand revolution!"

The fall of Beijing, the traditional capital of the nation, is seen as a sign of the old order being toppled and has inspired many to rise up against oppressors nation-wide.\n\nSeveral New Guangxi Clique generals have taken initiative, staging an attempted putsch in Nanning against Li Zongren. Led by cousins Li Mingrui, Yu Zuoyu, and Yu Zuobai, and aided by leftist activist Wei Baqun, they have quickly seized control of the Guangxi Teaching Corps, the Guangxi Guard Fourth Brigade and the Fifth Brigade. The New Guangxi clique has scrambled to fight back, and violence is expected to escalate.\n\nWhile the truce between left and right has always been tenuous and resistance against New Guangxi clique rule has been ongoing, especially in rural regions, the sheer speed and tenacity of the rebellion has stunned even the most dedicated ideologues of the party. Few had expected that red sympathies in the province extend even to senior level officers. The city, the capital of Guangxi Province, has been placed under martial law as various units chaotically flood in. The incident, too big to hide, is expected to inspire unrest across Liangguang and will have major ramifications for the region."

The New Guangxi clique has scrambled to fight back, successfully killing Li Mingrui in the fighting, and violence has quickly spiralled into various uprisings in Baise and Longzhou. As conflicting orders and scrambled communications throw the Guangxi army into disarray, the entire province plunges into pandemonium.\n\nLocal leftist committee members have begged [CHI.GetLeader] to intervene, but any response would be complicated by the fact that [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has already recognised Li Zongren as Governor of Guangxi. Withdrawing it would have dire consequences for the central government's legitimacy, though standing by him would dent our credibility among socialists.\n\nWith the central army overstretched and central authority limited in Liangguang, the task of actually supporting these rebels would likely fall on the neighbouring Guangdong Army. Indeed, many speculate that the Fourth Army may take action on its own initiative, sparing us any culpability for the outcome but potentially making [ROOT.GetLeader] appear impotent. The consequences of an intervention may be dire: involving Guangdong will destabilise all of Liangguang.

Guangxi is de facto in a state of civil war, and grotesque stories of violence flow down the Pearl River kindling resentment in Guangdong."
 GXC.midgame.543.closing: "The instructions, clear or not, have done little to resolve how bitterly divided the Guangdong committee has become. The province is also experiencing significant upheaval inspired by the fall of Beijing and now the rebellions in Guangxi, with many agitators increasingly taking aim at the \"petite bourgeoisie\" that make up much of Chen Mingshu's administration. General Chen in turn suspects both Tan Pingshan and Peng Pai of fanning the flames, breeding increasing mistrust as the two urge the Fourth Army be sent to aid the Guangxi rebels, openly insinuating that General Chen is more sympathetic to General Li than the people.

Within a few days, the van was already past Wuzhou, hugging the river for safety and supplies. Scattered Guangxi formations stood ahead of them, but few put up any resistance - it will not be long before they arrive in Nanning.\n\nNevertheless, Chen's indecision has already cost him. Faith in him has been falling in Guangzhou and reports of savage fighting in Guangxi have stirred fears of a prolonged quagmire among many military families. Stories have also spread of the poor behaviour of the Fourth Army, slanderous tales of their cowardice and how they loot from the poor while protecting the gentry like thugs. Many of these stories invoke similar tropes of older warlord armies, in fact some are simply retellings of older propaganda.\n\nEither way, General Chen's army lumbers on fighting not just their opponents in Guangxi but also a battle for their reputation at home. Chen Mingshu has sought to keep up appearances by making multiple public appearances at stops along the way and encouraging his men to write favourable letters to their friends and families at home.

His power is hardly unlimited, the council still remains effectively deadlocked, and Chen tried to force him to swear not to make any significant decisions without him, but still Tan is in charge. How long this will last, however, depends on the length of the Guangxi expedition.\n\nNot everyone wants to wait and find out. The CSP leaders he has allied with, along with some of the radical members of the PAC, have demanded that he seize the moment. Already many unions have begun wildcat strikes to demand Chen Mingshu's ouster, denouncing the Lame General as a revisionist and blaming him for not overthrowing General Li sooner. With the remaining security forces barely able to contain them, this might be the beginning of the end of Chen's rule.\n\nLiang Hancao has narrowly avoided being lynched at a Guangzhou party meeting, and First Lady Chen Bijun has ordered Li Shiqun and a detachment of Presidential Bodyguards to personally retrieve her brother Chen Yaozu from the city. The calls have flooded into Tan's office. An angry one from the President demanding order. Moderate PAC members, Chen Mingshu loyalists, RCA cadres, and RCF sympathisers have begged him to call for calm. The people in the streets cry for revolution.

Peng Pai has mobilised his peasant bands, overrunning and disarming Fourth Army outposts, in many cases without a fight. Isolated and undermanned, sometimes consisting of a rudimentary \"fortress\" consisting of a local police station or a large house, there was little to be done but retreat.\n\nBold moves encourage further action. Some have begun to harass the Fourth Army itself as it moves into Guangxi, seeing Chen Mingshu and Li Zongren as birds of a feather. The Baise uprising has lent a lot of credibility to Peng Pai's agrarian vision, but at the same time many of his rural loyalists have already gone to Guangxi on their own initiative to support the revolution there.\n\nFaced with overstretching his forces, Peng has little time to make a decision. Even with his now well developed secret communication networks, word takes time to reach his largely decentralised militias. Cutting off and wiping out rural garrisons is one thing, but capturing the real strongholds in the cities is no easy feat. It will require numbers, coordination, perhaps some fifth columnists. Difficult, but not impossible for a rural militia. Especially one as hardened and scrappy as his.\n\nTrue power in Guangdong lies in Guangzhou. With Chen's armies scattered, the cities in chaos, and revolutionary radicalism in the air, this might be Peng's moment - if only he is brave enough to seize it!"

Conflicting reports have reached his headquarters about the extent of the chaos, but what is clear is that riots have broken out in all major cities and the countryside is overrun by hooligans. Gentry, bourgeoisie, and gangster backed goons have made a resurgence, adding to the sense of anomie.\n\nWith Chen Yaozu having been recalled to [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], Liang Hancao is the last standing committee moderate remaining in Guangdong, his letters increasingly frantic as he struggles to keep order in Guangzhou. He begs General Chen to march home as soon as possible, having barricaded his own office out of fear for his life.\n\nThe arrival of the Fourth Army in Guangxi has caused the New Guangxi Clique's Seventh Army to disintegrate almost overnight, with many defecting to the Fourth Army for protection. This has swelled his ranks and allowed them to quickly secure Nanning, though Chen Mingshu's hold over the province is even more tenuous than in Guangdong.\n\nA break in the storm has emerged - Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi have offered to surrender to Chen, resigning his governorship and offering their armies to help Chen Mingshu restore order. Accepting would be seen as a great betrayal among the left, confirming their accusations of Chen Mingshu being an opportunist, but it might just be the advantage he needs to carry the day."

Sensing the power vacuum, radical Kuomintang and Syndicalist Party unions led by Tan Pingshan called a general strike while peasant militias under Peng Pai uprose, both hoping to secure Chen's removal for their own benefit.

Troops have been deployed into Guangxi, though by the time they arrived the Baise and Longzhou uprisings had proven far more potent than previously thought. Tan has appointed Yu Zuobai as Governor of Guangxi, making it clear who the true master of Liangguang is."
 GXC.midgame.553.a: "It pays to know people."

 GXC.midgame.554.t: "Peng Pai, the Dark Horse Candidate"
 GXC.midgame.554.d: "The telegram came as a shock to everyone. Chen Mingshu being dismissed was no surprise given the circumstances, but no one thought Peng Pai would be appointed in his place. Even Peng seemed genuinely stunned when he \"graciously\" accepted the position, not that it stopped him from looking smugly at the glowering Chen and Tan.\n\nWhy he was chosen remains an open mystery. Some muse that he was a compromise choice among the Central Committee, an agrarian like Song but suspicious of the Provisional Action Committee Maybe the people in [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] think him more moderate than he is, or recognise his popularity, or maybe...they even sympathise with him? Perhaps Wang chose him precisely because he is so radical - too radical to be a credible national threat.\n\nBut national politics can wait, Peng Pai's focus is on the present. Although Chen Mingshu and Tan Pingshan remain nominally in government, the standing committee has been sidelined and power has been centralised into Peng's hands along with his chief deputy Gu Dacun. Troops have surged into Guangxi, though by the time they arrived the Baise and Longzhou uprisings had proven far more potent than previously thought. Peng has appointed Wei Baqun as Governor of Guangxi, making it clear who the true master of Liangguang is."

 GXC.midgame.555.t: "Chen Mingshu Confirmed As Governor"
 GXC.midgame.555.d: "Despite the concerted efforts of the radicals, Guangdong is simply too valuable to the central government to allow it to be destabilised. Wang Jingwei has sent an open statement reminding all that Chen Mingshu as governor and should be afforded the dignity of one. Without naming any names the telegram warns against treasonous behaviour, declaring it contrary to the spirit of party unity. The gambit against Chen has failed.\n\nThe message continued with some prattle about the on-going revolution and trust, but few read any further. Chen was victorious and the crisis has made him a household name in Liangguang and beyond, drawing attention to his beliefs and allowing him to present himself as a moderate, benevolent figure in face of growing socialist radicalism.\n\nThe Lame General did not hesitate. Although Chen Mingshu and Tan Pingshan remain nominally in government, the standing committee has been sidelined and power has been centralised into Chen's hands along with his chief lieutenant Jiang Guangnai. A detachment has been sent to Guangxi, though by the time they arrived the Baise and Longzhou uprisings had proven far more potent than previously thought. Chen has appointed Yu Zuobai as Governor of Guangxi, making it clear who the true master of Liangguang is."

 GXC.midgame.556.d: "The Central Government has fallen, throwing Kuomintang loyalists into disarray. The Southeastern provinces have always been fairly autonomous entities, but even they are struggling to stomach the collapse as many others have surrendered to our advancing foes. Most of the old central government's leadership have fled abroad rather than be at the mercy of \"petty warlords\", and [ROOT.GetLeader] for his part has moved to seize control as acting President.\n\nHe faces a difficult challenge turning the tide, as his generals struggle to integrate other provincial units and many demoralised soldiers melt into the countryside, leaving \"ghost\" brigades and divisions. The economy has also been thrown into chaos as well as doubt rises over our ability to pay our debts.\n\nWith the situation rapidly growing dire, drastic action is needed and as the home of our movement Guangzhou is expected to once more carry the revolution's banner. But unity is quickly unravelling as defeatists insist we surrender and loyalists to the old central committee are accused of sabotaging our efforts. Angered by rumors of a potential defection, socialist insurgents have joined hardliner army officers in Guangxi to stage a major uprising in Guangxi, threatening to topple Li Zongren's rule.\n\nGuangdong is faring little better. Chen Mingshu and his army officers have moved to take command of a new revolutionary junta but he has been challenged by Tan Pingshan who has attempted to press his case through his alliance with radical urban unions. Peng Pai and his rural communes similarly refused to be ignored, throwing the region into further chaos. Whoever comes out on top, it better be soon or else the revolution is doomed."

 GXC.midgame.560.t: "A Change in Partners"
 GXC.midgame.560.d: "The Clash for Canton ended, like most Kuomintang battles, in a stalemate. Unable to break the upstart General Chen Jitang's grip on Guangzhou through General Chen Mingshu's intrigues, the leftist Central Executive Committee has decided to settle for a compromise. After intense negotiations between the two factions, the right aligned Kuomintang warlords of Guangdong and Guangxi, led by Chen Jitang and Li Zongren respectively, were recognised as the official governors of the province under [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. In return, both agreed to submit to the authority of President [CHI.GetLeader] and participate in the coming national revolutionary wars. By uniting Kuomintang forces in Nanjing and Guangzhou, left and right, the party as a whole has been greatly strengthened - a win-win for both sides.\n\nThe biggest loser of this arrangement, it seems, is Chen Mingshu and the other leftists of Liangguang. Used and discarded as failures, the New Fourth Army's influence has effectively dissolved overnight with the Central Government's orders to submit to the vindictive Chen Jitang's authority. Their funding and train of arms cut off now that Guangzhou is \"safely\" in Kuomintang hands, Chen's participation in the Guangdong Provincial Committee is increasingly nominal. The other socialist factions in the region, disgusted at being sold out, have gone their own directions in vain hopes of toppling the new order."

 GXC.midgame.561.d: "The successful completion of the Northern Expedition has given hope to leftists across China that a new dawn is rising. The fall of Beijing, the traditional capital of the nation, is seen as a sign of the old order being toppled and has inspired many to rise up against oppressors nation-wide.\n\nSocialist activists in Guangxi have taken the initiative, staging armed uprisings across the countryside in hopes of pressuring the Central Government to intervene. Led by Wei Baqun they have made advances on Baise and Longzhou hoping to spark a broader uprising but it seems that the New Guangxi army has held firm, reinforced by their alliance with the New Guangdong Clique. Though a mutiny has broken out among a few brigades of the Guangxi army, the cities of Nanning and Guilin were never in very serious danger thanks to the rapid deployment of Guangdong troops by [GXC.GetLeader].\n\nOther attempted uprisings by CSP unions in Guangzhou and Peng Pai's radical agrarians in Hailufeng were similarly quashed before the Kuomintang Central Government could intervene, ending socialist hopes of a red Liangguang. [CHI.GetLeader] could do little but call for calm and unity, a humiliating sign of weakness. By contrast, the southern alliance of rightist Kuomintang warlords have only consolidated in Guangdong's favour, a warning of the tensions expected to come."

By contrast, the southern alliance of rightist Kuomintang warlords have only consolidated in Guangdong's favour.\n\nAlready, word of the harsh suppression of the socialist rebels have made rounds in [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Our alliance with rightist Governors has always drawn scrutiny, and the wisdom of doing so has been called into question as harsh reprisals have eliminated hopes that these warlords would ever see the light of socialism. This has hardened opinions against further collaboration against our so-called comrades in the KMT Right, and many have called on the CEC to offer sanctuary for rebel leaders in our ranks. Nevertheless, an exodus of questionably trained insurgents into central government controlled territory can only spell further disorder and radicalisation. It also would force us to face our mistake working with the right."

 GXC.midgame.563.t: "Hu Hanmin Returns to Play"
 GXC.midgame.563.d: "The Liangguang Kuomintang's alliance with the left has not resolved tensions between the two. There is too much at stake, too many bad memories, too much ruthlessness for either side to fall for the false sense of security the pact has created. Governor Chen Jitang, ever wary of intrusions into his powerbase, has desperately sought ways to minimise socialist thought in Guangdong through various means. The Central Government in turn has sought to undermine his rule, looking for openings to oust the turbulent government and seize his valuable province.\n\nGovernor Chen has escalated today with a political coup. The governor meeting with delegations of old men would hardly be a new sight, except for the fact that these men have spent the better part of the last decade in Moscow. Their leader, Hu Hanmin - briefly the second Generalissimo of the Guangzhou Government and successor of Sun Yat-sen - is Wang Jingwei's arch-enemy in the party, perhaps even more so than the deceased Marshal Chiang. His followers include many civilian rightists in the party who broke ranks after the Fourth Plenum and fled overseas rather than participate in the Northern Expedition. And it seems that Governor Chen has invited them to stay.\n\nMore than that in fact. Chen has announced Hu Hanmin as the Chairman of the Southern Political Affairs Council, ostensibly to coordinate party matters in the region. This riposte goes beyond the normal rejections of [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]'s authority in local provinces during the normal warlord back and forth - it is a direct challenge on [CHI.GetLeader] and the leftist committee's claim to authority on all of China! The borderline treasonous behaviour of the right will likely cause the party to come to blows, but for now neither side seems ready to fight, at least not until unification. For now, Sun Fo and the other party moderates have sought to calm tensions, but they will not be successful for long."

They have invited Hu Hanmin and the Moscow Committee to return from exile as the nominal head of their new government though it may take some time (and some assurances of Guangzhou's stability) before they actually set foot back in China.

 GXC.midgame.570.t: "Rioting in Hong Kong"
 GXC.midgame.570.d: "The Kuomintang, a Chinese revolutionary and nationalist party, suffered significant divisions but has always been united in their hostility towards foreign legations. Their perennial choice of base in Guangzhou (Canton) has bred hostility with the neighbouring concessions in Hong Kong and Macau. Incidents such as the Shakee Riots and the Hong Kong-Canton protests contributed to the German intervention in the Northern Expedition.\n\nThe expansion of Chinese concessions to include numerous major cities along the Eastern coastline has only worsened the antipathy of Chinese nationalists towards foreigners, and with the Kuomintang's return to Guangzhou Hong Kong is once more in their sights. Emboldened by the presence of a leftist government Guangdong Province, Chinese Syndicalist and Kuomintang union organisers have coordinated a massive general strike in Hong Kong. Efforts to bring it to heel have provoked a riot which will take days to disperse. It seems that so long as a Red China exists, the concessions will remain a geopolitical hotspot."

 GXC.midgame.571.t: "How the Iron Army Got Its Name"
 #NOTE: Some significant alt history here since the Iron Army actually got its name from the Siege of Wuchang
 GXC.midgame.571.d: "The Guangdong Army was founded as the primary arm of the Constitutional Protection Government in 1917. Sun Yat-sen appointed Chen Jiongming as the commander of the Guangdong-Fujian Army, which fought off rival southern warlords before turning their sights northwards. Chen Jiongming's betrayal did not diminish its significance, and it was reorganised into the Fourth Army of the National Revolutionary Army in 1925.\n\nNow under Li Jishen's command, the fallout of the Liao Zhongkai assassination attempt resulted in the 4th Army becoming the counterbalance to rightist influence in the military. Marching into Hunan with other NRA armies, it was initially slated to continue with them to Wuchang but ultimately held in reserve as geopolitical tensions in the Pearl River delta escalated. The worst came to pass in October 1926 when German troops attacked Guangzhou, forcing them to fight a bloody rear-guard action. Despite the odds, the Fourth Army was able to resist the global hegemon's advance long enough to cover the CEC's evacuation from the city.\n\nTo commend their achievement, patriotic members of the local gentry and merchant class commissioned an iron shield in support of them, inscribed with a message: \"The blood of martyrs is the flower of doctrine. The great achievements of the Fourth Army are far-reaching. Be able to observe discipline and don't brag about your ability. If you can love the people, you can serve the country. To urge the front into battle is as strong as iron. The burden of revolution is like an iron shoulder. The function is like iron, and the people rely on it. May your life be as long as iron and last for billions of years.\"\n\nThe Fourth Army was ultimately deployed to Jinhua where they fought a bitter last stand. Afterwards, its remnant became the backbone of the MinGan insurgency with prominent commanders taking up key roles in the resistance. The legend of the \"Iron Army\" continues to grow, even as it wrests with what exactly its name means."
 GXC.midgame.571.a: "We charge to the front with hearts of iron!"
 GXC.midgame.571.b: "The people we love and serve rely on us like iron."
 GXC.midgame.571.c: "We bear the burden of revolution with an iron shoulder."

 GXC.midgame.572.t: "The Original Action Committee"
 GXC.midgame.572.d: "Sometime after the Northern Expedition collapsed, a small band of disillusioned Kuomintang leaders found themselves in Shanghai, straddling the border between exile and insurgency. Forced out of the Chinese Syndicalist Party, Tan Pingshan joined with other members of the Kuomintang to draw up plans for a new \"Chinese Revolutionary Party\" free of both. Unable to find much military traction, he saw little choice but to invite figures such as Deng Yanda to be its chairman.\n\nThe failure of the 1932 Shanghai Uprising weakened the Chinese socialist movement, and forced them to retreat to their remaining bases in MinGan. Song Qingling, Li Jishen, and Deng Yanda formally published the \"Declaration to the Revolutionary People in China and the World\", announcing the formation of the Provisional Action Committee of the Kuomintang using Chinese Revolutionary Party circles as a foundation. This effectively claimed independent leadership of MinGan from the exiled Paris Committee but avoided abandoning the Kuomintang label of Song's husband. Under Song and Deng, Tan soon found himself sidelined from his own party.\n\nEmbittered, Tan stewed until he finally received a second chance with the socialist takeover of Guangdong. Under Tan's leadership, the MinGan and Guangdong branches of the PAC have quickly diverged. The northern PAC faction has a primarily agrarian and military popular base, counting on peasant governments and the WMARCA for influence. The southern faction tends towards an urban and intellectual base, seeking the support of unions and \"classical socialist\" cadres. Tan maintains a chip on his shoulder, especially since Deng and Song remain both more popular among the people and are better connected among the elite than he is. He still dreams of a third party, independent of the shortcomings of the KMT and CSP, but he has a long way to go if he wants to see it happen."
 GXC.midgame.572.a: "We need to make our message more palatable to learned circles."
 GXC.midgame.572.b: "Like our MinGan brethren, we must not forget the peasants."
 GXC.midgame.572.c: "As one, our third movement will bring the world revolution to China!"

 GXC.midgame.573.t: "The Haifeng Soviet"
 GXC.midgame.573.d: "Peng Pai got his start as a young director of the Haifeng County Education Bureau with the support of Chen Jiongming and the local student body. Already inspired by the French revolution, he began to clash with his fellow gentrymen before being dismissed for organising a May Day ceremony. Undeterred, he founded the Haifeng County General Farmer's Association.\n\nThis association, with far-reaching social policies, exploded in popularity. Providing medical care, agricultural guidance, personal protection, and mediation for marriage, debts, and land ownership disputes - its comprehensive nature meant it could easily become the foundation of a parallel government. Spreading visual-oriented pamphlets and oral propaganda for illiterate peasants as well as defending farmers in court for rent arrears in several high profile cases, by the mid 1920s it represented over a hundred thousand farmers in Haifeng (nearly a quarter of the population) and rapidly spread across Guangdong.\n\nThe Northern Expedition saw Peng Pai's ambitions restrained back to his home base of Haifeng, and his (renamed) Guangdong Farmer's Association splintered off from the mainline Kuomintang. Despite most ties being severed after the 1932 Shanghai Uprising, the return of the Kuomintang has brought them back into the fold but it's clear that they are de facto separate movements by this point.\n\nPeng and his lieutenants have kept their options open. Converging back into the mainline socialist movement would be the noble act according to the party-line, but trusting them to protect our interests is a tough sell. There has been talk about extending our reach to the urban proletariat, since surely the peasants and workers are not so different, but so far they have had little traction in the cities thanks to the CSP. Whatever the case, Haifeng remains a potent base of operations and will likely continue to do so in the near future."
 GXC.midgame.573.a: "KMT, CSP, and GFA must all band together!"
 GXC.midgame.573.b: "Fighting for the peasants, we forge our own way!"
 GXC.midgame.573.c: "We must reach into the cities for the sake of the workers!"

 GXC.midgame.574.t: "The \"Good\" Warlord of Guangxi"
 GXC.midgame.574.d: "Since the beginning, the Kuomintang has taken under its wing various \"patriotic\" warlords, ignoring past rightist proclivities and sweeping their abuses against the people under the rug for the sake of revolutionary pragmatism. In turn, said warlords are expected to pay lip service to the ideals of the Three Principles and submit themselves to the central committee.\n\nIn practise this is an uneasy arrangement, and nowhere is this more visible than in Liangguang. While Li Zongren and the New Guangxi clique have notably reoriented their political identity from regional provincialism to an embrace of Dr. Sun, they remain resentful of Guangdong's dominance in the relationship. Now, with leftists ruling Guangzhou tensions are high. A lot of leftists in Guangxi have come out of the woodwork, forming their own unions, party branches, and study groups independent of the provincial committee. There are some rumours that even some members of the high command have fallen under their sway. Conversely, Li has been accused of harbouring rightists fleeing persecution from Guangzhou and keeping in contact with the Cantonese elite who hope leftist rule is just another passing phase in Guangzhou's history.\n\nNaturally, these complaints have been forwarded to Governor Chen Mingshu to handle. Many within our own provincial committee have called for him to take a harder line on Governor Li, leveraging Guangdong's control of the Pearl River trade to pressure Guangxi towards a more \"Orthodox\" line."
 GXC.midgame.574.a: "Chen Mingshu works to soothe tensions."
 GXC.midgame.574.b: "Radical activists push for further changes."

 GXC.midgame.575.t: "The Crown Prince's Clique"
 GXC.midgame.575.d: "Once upon a time, when Guangzhou was the primary bastion of the Kuomintang, the fresh Columbia graduate and only son of the Eternal Premier was appointed Mayor of the city. Surrounding this (derogatorily dubbed) \"Crown Prince\" was a circle of young, liberal, and Western-educated technocrats that became known as the \"Crown Prince's Clique\". Many of them would remain with him throughout the years, coalescing into its modern incarnation as the \"Reconstruction Faction\".\n\nLiang Hancao, while concurrently holding many prestigious national titles (sinecures of this nature is common practice in the party-state), has migrated south with an entourage in tow, no doubt under orders from Sun Fo to rebuild their southern powerbase. Taking office as the KMT Party Secretary for Guangzhou, he has made a point of courting the local intellectual and business class, quickly locking horns with the considerably more radical Guangdong CSP Party Secretary Deng Zhongxia.\n\nAfter several skirmishes over comparatively minor positions in Guangzhou and growing tired of haggling, Liang has pressed forward with his effort to install major Sun Fo allies to key positions of authority across the Guangdong administration, including the well connected Wu Chaoshu, the banker Huang Hanliang, and political palatable Wang Kunlun. The CSP, with Tan Pingshan's backing, has moved stridently to block these appointments, threatening further unrest in the streets."
 GXC.midgame.575.a: "The Provincial Council approves these appointees to appease the moderates."
 GXC.midgame.575.b: "The Provincial Council rejects these appointees to support the united front."

 GXC.midgame.576.t: "Politics of Guangdong Syndicalism"
 GXC.midgame.576.d: "Guangzhou has always been one of the two centres of Chinese syndicalism, and now with the new leftist government it is much safer than Shanghai. Beneath the surface, the syndicalist scene in Guangdong can be quite complicated. The original League of Chinese Syndicalists was a broad tent movement, made up of any socialist that the CSP could find that did not want to be primarily affiliated with the KMT. What identity they should take beyond that has always been controversial.\n\nThe primary leader of the Guangdong CSP is Deng Zhongxia. Deng is a famed labour organiser and one of the founders of the LCS and the All-China Federation of Labour. This allowed him to play a major role in the Canton-Hong Kong strike along with Su Zhaozheng. Su is a prominent leader of the Sailor's Union, next in stature to Deng in the Guangdong CSP. Both broadly adhere to the \"Orthodox\" line of the CSP though ties with the National branch in Nanjing have grown strained. Tan Pingshan has been making a case for them to split off with him to form an independent syndicalist movement.\n\nStrongly opposed to that suggestion is Yan Hanzhang, aggressively prioritising armed uprising in the cities led by workers and the extension of the revolution to the whole country. This ultra-urban focused approach has drawn criticisms for its radicalism, inflexibility and questionable efficacy. Many say this tactic has only played into the hands of the rightists who have rallied against them and made the KMT more palatable by extension.\n\nOn the sidelines, the local CSP Radicals have found their leader in Zhang Tailei. One of several young Chinese syndicalists that went to Europe along with Chen Shaoyu and Qiu Qibai, Zhang Tailiei he commands a relatively fringe following. The radicals are that social emancipation entitles all proletariat, even bandits and thieves, to rise up and to thereby expel imperialists and reactionaries from Guangzhou in order to lead the vanguard of a true worker's commune."

 GXC.midgame.577.t: "The Reorganised Comrades of Guangdong"
 GXC.midgame.577.d: "Chen Yaozu has come south from [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to rule as the new Mayor of Guangzhou. The brother of First Lady Chen Bijun, the obvious nepotism in his appointment belies the fact that he is no fool. Like his sister, he was born to a wealthy Malaysian Chinese merchant family, which afforded him an education in Guangdong and Japan. He has a long history of working in Kuomintang administrations in the city - indeed, the Wangs and the Reorganised Comrades Association as a whole were originally Cantonese based.\n\nAnd perhaps that is why his true orders from his sister, who frequently visits, is to carve out a Cantonese fiefdom loyal to Wang Jingwei. Chen Bijun is a calculating woman and a power in her own right, quite cognisant that the shift of the party's centre of power to Nanjing has left a major power-vacuum in Guangzhou. Disloyalty, in her eyes, is rampant and she is determined not to lose Guangzhou.\n\nUnfortunately for her, Chen Yaozu is not as strong-willed and cunning as she is, and despite his lofty position his control over the city, much less the province, is limited to parts of the civilian administration and party apparatus. This has made him effectively dependent on Chen Mingshu and his sister, his efforts further complicated by the perennial disagreements within Wang's camp on a national level. Chen Bijun's Residence (disparagingly translated as Palace) faction is often at odds with Chen Gongbo's Reorganised Comrades Association. Chen Yaozu is one of the few Residence Faction members to formally join the RCA, reflecting their desperation in reestablishing a foothold in the city they once called home. Despite his apparent weakness, his decisions may prove pivotal in the future."

 ##LKMT Domestic Affairs (580-589)

 GXC.midgame.580.t: "The Secret Societies of Guangdong"
 GXC.midgame.580.d: "In a province notable for hosting several revolutionary governments over the last few decades, it is no surprise that secret societies are ubiquitous. For the Kuomintang, the most controversial has been the Hongmen (literally translated as \"Vast Family\"). The Hongmen may have had their roots in Ming loyalists following the Qing conquest of China in the 1700s, meant as a form of mutual aid for Southern Chinese. This soon became mutual protection when Qing authorities banned them, spurring many to become revolutionaries.\n\nA fraternal, secretive alliance of smaller groups, the Hongmen have been compared to the Freemasons in Europe. Chapters were established overseas during the 18th century, and they became a major contributor to Sun Yat-sen's Tongmenghui.\n\nTheir activities after the 1911 Revolution have been less laudable among Kuomintang circles. Left without a purpose once the Qing were vanquished, the Hongmen split into factions. Some sought to bring down colonial rule in Hong Kong, while many large ones ended up supporting Chen Jiongming and his Guangdong army. Others became affiliated with organised crime and were dubbed the \"triads\" by British authorities, though the lines often blur when it comes to revolutions. The Hongmen remain divisive within the party, with some expressing more sympathy for them while others calling for a harsh crackdown on their activities."
 GXC.midgame.580.a: "Their fierce Revolutionary action is to be praised, not dishonoured!"
 GXC.midgame.580.b: "Valuable as they once were, they're nothing more than bandits."

 GXC.midgame.581.t: "The Hlai People"
 GXC.midgame.581.d: "The Hlai people, also often referred to as the Li people, are an ethnic group that inhabit southern China and northern Vietnam, with a large concentration in the island of Qiongya. Traditionally animists, Hlai legends say each of their clans originate from the marriage of a woman and a divine animal. Possessing a unique language and culture, [GXC.GetLeader] and other Liangguang government leaders have made a point of visiting during this year's Oxen Festival, a major event during the spring. Oxen play a major role in Hlai economic life, so on the eighth day of the third lunar month the Hlai honour them to help ensure a good harvest that year.\n\nScholars speculate the Hlai originated in the Leizhou Peninsula before migrating southwards to Qiongya and much of the coast. Growing Han migration in the 1700s saw tensions arise as the Song dynasty centralised power and tried to assimilate them, though many remained in the relatively impoverished highlands. This may have contributed to their support of socialist movements (though few secessionist movements), which made them targets of harsh repression by reactionary forces. Their villages were razed on several occasions and their food stolen by occupying forces. Nevertheless, with the leftist victory in Liangguang, their loyalty has been rewarded. The central government has approved several autonomous counties to be established on the island. One can hope this is a positive sign for relations to come."
 GXC.midgame.581.a: "May all within China be rewarded as such."

 GXC.midgame.582.d: "Curiously, a new curriculum has appeared in the discourse of the Kuomintang's base of operations in Liangguang. From peasant training institutes along the Pearl River to worker's assemblies deep in the industrial sector of Guangzhou - political instructors have been gleefully instructing their ambitious pupils to read the writings of the great \"Ma the Big Beard\" and his comrade Engles in their crusade against capitalism.\n\nPortraits of Marx adorn every classroom, and it isn't just Marx but prominent socialists such as Jack Reed, Vladimir Lenin, Tom Mann, and Jean Zyromski who are frequently mentioned by quick-spoken party commissars and instructors. For many of the peasant and urban proletariat of Guangdong, indeed the fallout of Black Monday seemed to justify Marx's own words of the demise of capitalism. Political instructors make frequent denunciations of local rural elite and Guangdong capitalists such as the Merchant Corps - as justification for the war of liberation needed against not just imperialists but also their despicable spawns of capitalism.\n\nIn southern China, where few can grow such spectacular facial hair as the esteemed political thinker, these teachings and daily lectures have appealed to those from the Gansu region of China who are residing in revolutionary Liangguang. Those who have served under the Ma Clique have expressed a wondrous enthusiasm at the great revolutionary- seeing themselves as pupils of yet another member of the ever large \"Ma\" clan."
 GXC.midgame.582.a: "Advise corrections of the curriculum, what nonsense are they preaching?"
 GXC.midgame.582.b: "All shall hear the praises of the great \"Ma the Big Beard\"!"

 GXC.midgame.583.t: "Little Red Devils"
 GXC.midgame.583.d: "As foreign journalists and correspondents traverse the new revolutionary government based in Liangguang, many foreigners have come to realise that the Chinese socialist revolution is exemplified in no greater body of society than the young boys and girls in peasant communes such as the Hailufeng Campaign. Party propaganda frequently laudes the efforts of the young, who are willing to forego their innocence and childhood - for the sake of national revolution.\n\nNicknamed as the \"Little Red Devils\", the revolutionary government in Guangzhou has prioritised encouraging a fruitful political education encompassing topics such as the Three Principles of the People and Socialism. From a young age, the children of party-organised communes such as the Hailufeng Commune are encouraged to pick up basic military training and political education, hoping they would be the obedient future vanguard of the Chinese National and Proletariatian revolution. Some of these children are orphans themselves, having lost their fathers and mothers to brutal reactionary repression, with no home to take them in - they have been scouted out and recruited into the party's growing apparatus for nurturing the youth of China. For many of them, participation in the National Revolutionary Army and the national revolution - presents an opportunity for a bowl of rice, a chance to escape poverty, and an ever-closer dream towards the realisation of socialism in China."
 GXC.midgame.583.a: "Steeled in their hearts, our Devils never cry!"
 GXC.midgame.583.b: "Let the youths enjoy their childhood, please."
 GXC.midgame.583.c: "Political training is a necessity, but militarisation?"

 GXC.midgame.584.t: "Living Newspapers"
 GXC.midgame.584.d: "Foreign correspondents from countries within the Third Internationale have written extensively on the portrayal of \"living newspapers\" within the Nationalist Revolution currently ongoing in Liangguang. They describe with vibrant enthusiasm, that the people of China are seemingly expanding their idea and notions of class consciousness and that China, despite being a rather pre-industrial society, is experiencing a revival and revolution akin to that within the Frente Obrero Patagonico and the revolution in Spain.\n\nAs most of the rural peasantry of Liangguang cannot still read and write, political instructors have resorted to the commissioning of assemblies to teach complex matters such as class conflict and imperialism. Members of Shanghai acting troupes with strong socialist inclinations have arrived to the province to join the ongoing efforts towards the national revolution, by presenting plays as part of revolutionary education and curriculum.\n\nAs the correspondents observe, these plays are nothing compared to the great operas held in Moscow and Vienna but nonetheless involve the peasantry themselves - who have taken it upon themselves to create make-shift costumes for characters such as Wu Peifu, wicked capitalists, and other degenerative elements of western imperialism. Common themes of these plays involve stories involving warlord armies or landlords oppressing the pure and innocent rural and urban proletariat before being subdued by the righteous and commendable bravery of revolutionaries and the National Revolutionary Army. Battles especially the many skirmishes of the MinGan Insurgency and the League War are frequently depicted, with children using broomsticks as props for rifles."
 GXC.midgame.584.a: "China is a true hallmark of independent revolutionary spirit!"
 GXC.midgame.584.b: "Our peasant's illiteracy is not to be applauded..."

 GXC.midgame.585.t: "The New Man"
 GXC.midgame.585.d: "With the revolution in full swing, though the party speaks of a revolution of the masses and collective strength, they hardly forget the individual. Indeed, inspired by utopian ideals of \"New Men\" and \"New Women\" as well as the social darwinism exposed by Dr. Sun, the latest drive by the [GXC.GetAdjective] government has been to promote individual reflection and development to create a better breed of Chinese revolutionaries.\n\nUtilising slogans derived from earlier groups such as the YMCA, this movement seeks to create \"Model Citizens\" that are both peak physical specimens, productive and laborious experts in their field, selfless in personality, and perhaps most importantly, well educated in socialist theory. A parallel movement for \"Thought Reform\" has been pressed onto intellectual sectors as leading Chinese socialists call on them to remould the way they think away from the bourgeois degeneracy that has marked the previous age and reorient themselves to the incoming socialist future.\n\nThe motivations behind these efforts are fairly plain to see. With wars looming and foreign aid thousands of miles away, the national revolution will require extraordinary efforts both in fighting and production to win. On the other hand, there are significant ideological undercurrents for this as well. Many party members are social darwinists, believing that weak individuals and weak peoples are soon wiped out, and stressing the physical and mental fortitude of their followers is a way of establishing moral superiority when contrasted with the popular image of corrupt, inept, and drug-addled warlord soldiers. Similarly, the idea of a \"New Man\" to go along with the incoming new age of civilisation many socialists believe is imminent feels natural, sometimes taking almost religious undertones. While public reception can be lukewarm, the party faithful are expected to strive for sound minds and sound bodies to become sound revolutionaries."
 GXC.midgame.585.a: "Only the strong may bring socialism."
 GXC.midgame.585.b: "The sheer ruthlessness? Have you no heart?"
 GXC.midgame.585.c: "Thought Reform? Are you serious?"

 ##LKMT Satellite Affairs (590-599)
 GXC.midgame.590.t: "Guangzhou, the Revolutionary Outpost"
 GXC.midgame.590.d: "The central government in [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has ordered the reestablishment of its foreign ministry under Chen Youren. While the Nationalist government's claim over China remains only quasi-recognised even within the Internationale, it is still a major step forward in building a new government for the nation. Circling around the Kuomintang include many sister parties consisting of smaller Kuomintang inspired left nationalist movements hoping to liberate their homelands in East and Southeast Asia.\n\nLiangguang has always been a friendly base for these plucky freedom fighters, no matter the government. The Kuomintang, Chen Jiongming, and even Lu Rongting have always been rather sympathetic in particular to Vietnamese nationalists resisting French and later German colonialism. Many groups freely took advantage of Guangzhou to plot and organise, and even launch cross border raids from Guangxi. Their tendency to smuggle opium to make ends meet drew some attention from Chen, but for the most part they were tolerated or even supported by successive Liangguang governments.\n\nToday three major Vietnamese groups have some presence in the area. The left leaning VNQDD is the largest, with their \"Overseas Ministry of the Vietnamese Nationalist Party\" traditionally represented by older political figures like Phan Boi Chau. More ideologically moderate, they have mostly avoided trouble. The VNQPH operates bases in Guilin, with right and liberal leaning cells that keep some distance from the others. Lastly the Communist League retains some presence in Guangzhou, albeit severely reduced thanks to unfavourable relations with Chen and Lu. Quite a few in their Overseas Command Committee prefer Macau as their hideout, shuttling between the two as necessary.\n\nThe Indochinese revolt has largely emptied the province of the more active fighters. Still, a few remain in the area and have become an object of fascination for many more internationalist members of the party."
 GXC.midgame.590.a: "The VNQDD have always been like a sister to us."
 GXC.midgame.590.b: "The VNQPH have the right ideas."
 GXC.midgame.590.c: "The Communist League is a striking band."

 GXC.midgame.591.t: "A New Legislative Yuan"
 GXC.midgame.591.d: "The central government in [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has finally come around to establishing a provisional Legislative Yuan, which has begun summoning delegates from each province. Since Guangdong is the home of a disproportionate number of existing Kuomintang leaders, many seats designated for Guangdong have been \"reserved\" by Kuomintang luminaries. Protests, especially from younger and less politically entrenched cadres, that we have little say over our leaders despite our significant contributions have been waved away. Some counter by saying this is the price we pay for the fact that Guangdong also gets a disproportionate number of patronage positions in the bureaucracy.\n\nWith the central government unwilling to budge on the number of seats allocated to Guangdong, and many seats claimed by individuals tightly embedded to the national government, the remaining seats are tightly contested. The exact rules for office during political tutelage have not yet been fully defined either, with some advising that the provincial committee submit our roster in short order while others suggesting that we should hold party elections so there is some semblance of democracy. A small number of seats were supposed to be reserved for independents and our United Front allies, but would anyone really care if they were \"redistributed\" to more deserving candidates?"
 GXC.midgame.591.a: "The Provincial Committee can decide swiftly and fairly."
 GXC.midgame.591.b: "Party cadres should elect their representatives."
 GXC.midgame.591.c: "We should make room for more KMT members."

 GXC.midgame.592.t: "[GetYear] Land Reform Act"
 GXC.midgame.592.d: "Part and parcel to the Kuomintang's political and economic reconstruction plan is the promise of land reform. Dr. Sun Yat-sen included Land Equalisation as part of his original National Reconstruction Plan, heavily influenced by Georgism. Over the years, various impromptu land reform efforts have been made both in Guangdong and during the MinGan insurgency, but there rarely was enough sustained effort or stability for any programme to make a significant dent in the problem.\n\nThe new government in Nanjing has decided to flex its muscles by passing a series of directives related to agricultural policy. The most significant is a pilot land reform programme in Jiangsu (near Nanjing) designed to be a model for others to follow. Naturally, PAC leaders in Jiangxi and Fujian have taken initiative on their own to begin redistributing land, an extension of prior efforts by the MinGan. As one of the largest and wealthiest provinces, there have been calls for us to launch a pilot programme of our own, helping our own struggling peasants from their plight. And, admittedly, this might be an opportunity to show up the national government while we are at it.\n\nTwo broad currents compete for our attention. A more moderate agenda has been proposed that would implement a long-desired 37.5% land rent cap which will be paired with forced purchases from landlords of unused or excess lands by the government with a mixture of direct compensation, government bonds, and stocks in state-owned industries. Purchased land would then be sold at a discount to the peasants already working on it.\n\nA more radical proposal is to orchestrate forcible seizures of land from the gentry. Some strategic regions will be totally nationalised and others allowed to remain in the hands of small landholders, but the bulk will be converted into peasant cooperatives. Of course, rather than pursue either option, it might be best to wait for the results of other pilot programs for further study."
 GXC.midgame.592.a: "We pursue a moderate land to the tiller programme."
 GXC.midgame.592.b: "We need a radical redistribution of the land!"
 GXC.midgame.592.c: "We must be cautious and await directives."

 GXC.midgame.593.t: "Power to the United Front"
 GXC.midgame.593.d: "The United Front has always been a divisive issue within the party, but widely embraced by the left during the tail end of the original Kuomintang party split. The Chinese Syndicalist Party was founded independently of the Kuomintang, ordered to join forces with the Kuomintang by Paris in exchange for the Internationale's support of the Chinese revolution, but the arrangement has always been uneasy. The CSP has tried to maintain further autonomy by forming the League of Chinese Syndicalists but the League has similarly been unwieldy.\n\nThe Kuomintang Central Committee's return from their exile in France has not reduced the complexity of the situation. Exposure by many of the exiles to life in France and Britain have made many exiles sympathetic though others have hardened against either what they perceive as the revolutionary excesses in Britain, the chaos of \"democracy\" in France, or perceptions of hypocritical racism in Europe. For those who never left, the returnees are seen with some private scorn, deemed cowardly and excessively xenophilic carpetbaggers by many.\n\nAs the United Front is rebuilt in the north, some in Liangguang are wondering whether they should follow Nanjing's lead. Guangzhou has always been more receptive to radical union activity, but this has not always translated to support for syndicalism which remains a foreign concept to many. Many moderates blame syndicalism for triggering the devastating German intervention during the Northern Expedition, though others recall the courage of syndicalist activists in resisting the occupation. What is clear is that if syndicalism cannot find its home in Guangzhou, it will not have success anywhere else in China."
 GXC.midgame.593.a: "We should embrace the alliance wholeheartedly."
 GXC.midgame.593.b: "We must stop this foreign madness from spreading!"
 GXC.midgame.593.c: "We will do the bare minimum to accommodate them."

 GXC.midgame.594.t: "Revolutionary Culture, Revolutionary People"
 GXC.midgame.594.d: "The ailing Qing dynasty and its weakness in face of foreign imperialism has soured many towards the Chinese traditionalism they represent. The New Culture Movement, ironically inspired by late Qing dynasty reforms, sprung up after the Xinhai Revolution, opening up discourse about the state of Chinese society that often borders on iconoclasm. Calling for greater use of Chinese vernacular, the family structure, egalitarianism, nationalism, and a forward thinking orientation, it demands that Chinese economic modernisation come hand in hand with social modernisation. It has also triggered significant backlash from conservatives for its excesses, especially when paired with revolutionary action.\n\nThe Kuomintang as a party has had a complicated relationship with the New Culture Movement. Uncontroversial within the party are issues like women's emancipation and equality - especially issues such as the elimination of women's footbinding and to a lesser extent polygamy. However, as the movement veers into uncomfortable territory related to sexual and social norms, there has been pushback by some of the very intellectuals that first articulated the principles of the movement.\n\nLikewise in the political sphere, the call for Mr. Science and Mr. Democracy to take the lead has many sympathisers within the left but activists have also criticised integral parts of the Kuomintang doctrine such as the need for tutelage and the vanguard party. Attacks on Chinese culture and Confucian values have also meshed poorly with the party's patriotic rhetoric, especially among the right.\n\nThe Central Government has tried to put their own spin on things, ordering their propaganda and education organs to help craft (some say synthetically) a revolutionary culture fit for a new China. How receptive the people of Liangguang (and our own government) will be is another matter."
 GXC.midgame.594.a: "Times are changing, and so must we!"
 GXC.midgame.594.b: "We can blend revolution and tradition."
 GXC.midgame.594.c: "There's rebellion and there is..."

###Section 3d (600-799): Mid Game UPC Political Events

 ##Guangzhou Federalist Conference Event Chain (600-619)
 GXC.midgame.600.t: "The Guangzhou Federalist Conference"
 GXC.midgame.600.d: "With Liangguang now firmly under Chen Jiongming's thumb, the Governor has turned his attention to national matters. Inviting Federalist figures from across the nation, Chen and his allies have made their ambitions clear to the entire nation: to rebuild the seemingly dead Federalist movement and establish a new national government in Guangzhou.\n\nThis Conference is somewhat of a spiritual successor to the series of Federalist conferences held in the 1920s, most notably during Hunan's Constitutional drafting in 1920, and the 1922 \"Conference on Public Affairs\" in Shanghai held by various civic organisations.\n\nRelative to Guangdong, Chen himself hosted two conferences in Shantou in 1924. The May conference revolved around handling the Kuomintang and included representatives from the Anhui, Zhili, and northern Federalist factions. The second, in November, was grimmer in tone - held after the Merchants Corps incident and included representatives from Jiangxi, Hunan, Fujian, and Yunnan. There, the fateful decision not to attend the 1925 Beijing Reunification Conference and to launch an ultimately doomed campaign against Guangzhou was made. And of course, the Public Interest Party was founded in San Francisco in 1925 in a separate conference.\n\nThus, conferences such as these have had a sizable impact on the historical Federalist movement, and this one will likely be no different. Hosted under the banner of the \"Grand Republican Alliance\", most of the parties in attendance are Liangguang based: Zhang Junmai's DSP, Chen Lianbo's AACSG, and of course Chen Jiongming's PIP. Whether deliberately or not, other Federalist groups such as Tang Jiyao's People's Government Party, Chu Fucheng's Zhejiang Autonomy Movement, Zhao Hengti's People's Renewal Society, Xiong Kewu's Provincial Federal Autonomy Preparation Office, and various independent Federalists like Zhang Taiyan sent observers but were instead sidelined by Chen."
 GXC.midgame.600.a: "Truly a moment for Chen Jiongming to shine!"
 GXC.midgame.600.b: "A show of unity by all Federalists left in China!"

 GXC.midgame.601.t: "The Guangzhou Federalist Government"
 GXC.midgame.601.d: "The Federalist Movement, which most thought had faded into irrelevance after the early 1920s, has returned. Led by Guangdong Warlord Chen Jiongming and his \"Grand Republican Alliance\" of various Federalist parties, they have gathered various intellectuals and representatives from southern provinces to Guangzhou for several weeks of discussion. While the debate is expected to be lively, the outcome is foregone: at the end of it \"Governor\" Chen Jiongming will become \"President\" Chen Jiongming of a new rival government in the south. How long this one will last will likely be determined on the battlefield."
 GXC.midgame.601.a: "Our representatives there will keep an eye on the situation."
 GXC.midgame.601.b: "A secessionist movement rears its ugly head."
 GXC.midgame.601.c: "A brilliant success for Chen Jiongming!"

 GXC.midgame.602.t: "Chen's National Reconstruction Plan"
 GXC.midgame.602.d: "The first major topic discussed was Chen Jiongming's Plan for National Reconstruction. Largely similar to the one he published in May 1922, on the eve of war between him and Sun Yat-sen, it outlines a moderate Federalist future for China - especially compared to radicals like Zhang Taiyan who sought the effective dismantling of the central government.\n\nModelled after the American government, Chen's republic would share power between the provinces (which would remain the same as the current ones). The provinces would elect senators to present provincial interests, and a house of representatives would be drawn from local bodies to represent the interests of the people. The central government will have exclusive domain over the military, national security, and foreign relations, but provinces will not be responsible for supporting armies and military and civilian administration will be strictly separated. Finances would be divided between the central government and provincial governments, and responsibilities over the judiciary, education, industry and communications are to be decided at a later date.\n\nThe most radical departure from his 1922 is how to achieve their goal. At the time, Chen proposed three steps for unification. First, that all provinces should commit to achieving that Federalist vision. They would then send representatives to a conference to draft a final version. Finally, reunification would then be achieved through the voluntary creation of a Federation. He also proposed Sun Yat-sen and Duan Qirui as the top candidates for President and Vice President [Translator's Note: Chen took pains to avoid using the title of President, preferring the use of Chief Executive, but for ease we will exclusively use President].\n\nThe failure of negotiations in 1923 and unification by force in 1927 largely discredited that approach, and all can agree force of arms will likely be required. And everyone knows who is the top candidate for President in [GetYear]."
 GXC.midgame.602.a: "This plan will surely encourage the cooperation of the provinces!"
 GXC.midgame.602.b: "It is high time that we woke up to the reality of China's situation."

 GXC.midgame.603.t: "The DSP's Ten Point Programme"
 GXC.midgame.603.d: "The DSP, other groups, and various independents who recently joined the GRA (most of them veterans of the Federation of Chinese Democratic Parties which sought to encourage democracy from within the Zhili government in the early 1930s), drafted a Ten Point Programme for the new Guangzhou Federalist Government. Opening with a preamble about unity, the points include vows to:\n\n1. Resist foreign imperialism and totally recover China's territorial integrity - opposing compromise with foreign powers.\n2. Realise the spirit of multi-party democracy and prepare for the drafting of a constitution.\n3. Strengthen internal unity and resolve inter-party conflict.\n4. Assist the GRA in executing their Plan for National Reconstruction.\n5. Firmly establish unity of national authority and properly divide central and local power.\n6. Ensure the armed forces belong to the nation and are loyal to it rather than military or regionalist cliques, and prevent its use to resolve domestic disputes.\n7. Carry out rule of law and protect the people's freedoms of life, property, and person from illegal punishments.\n8. Respect intellectual and academic freedom, particularly of legal speech, publication, assembly, and associations.\n9. Emphasise non-partisanship in the military, schools, the government, and public finances. Officials should be selected on the basis of moral character and ability.\n10. Vigorously carry out economic, administrative, and supervisory reforms to promote economic reconstruction.\n\nThere has been some debate over its pending publication. Drafted by an independent, Zhang Junmai and other DSP leaders have hesitated in publishing the entirety of the 10 Points, fearing some of it may cause the Yue Army and other Warlords to view them as a threat. But many of the more idealistic independents demand it be published in full lest they walk out. A compromise has been proposed, which is to publish it anonymously under the defunct FCDP label."
 GXC.midgame.603.a: "The authorities be damned, let them know what we stand for!"
 GXC.midgame.603.b: "Hiding behind anonymity, the democrats raise their points in full."
 GXC.midgame.603.c: "Pragmatic self-censorship allows for stability and diplomacy."

 GXC.midgame.604.t: "Federalist Flags and Symbols"
 GXC.midgame.604.d: "While the Guangzhou Federalist Government officially flies the Five Races Under One Union Flag, the symbol of the 1911 Republic, for easier identification party flags often fly alongside it. Like most things with the Federalist movement, even the flag did not come easily.\n\nWhile in exile in Japan, Tongmenghui leaders began debating over a party flag. Two of the finalists were the White Sun, Blue Sky, and Wholey Red Earth flag (a modification of Lu Haodong's design) and the blue, white and red \"Jing\" flag designed by Liao Zhongkai. The \"Jing\" character (which resembles a tic-tac-toe board) is the symbol of the traditional well-field system in China - for every eight plots of individually owned land, the middle ninth one would be tilled for the common good (or the local lord). Centuries later, it became a symbol of communicable solidarity.\n\nSun Yat-sen strongly supported the White Sun, Blue Sky flag and demanded its adoption - triggering a bitter, prolonged fight between the exiled revolutionaries. In the end, the issue was tabled though Sun would end up adopting the White Sun as his party flag. For his opponents within the Tongmenghui, the incident became symbolic of Sun's early authoritarianism and the Federalists would ultimately adopt the Jing Flag - the PIP (and now the GRA) would adopt it as their party flag and Chen Jiongming would use a variant for his Marshal's flag.\n\nThe Democratic Socialist Party also adopted a flag with the Jing symbol. A \"bright red, pure white, and iron black\" party flag with a green Jing emblem at its centre, the red is said to represent warm compassion, white for openness and social justice, and black for firm will and discipline. The green Jing symbol represents the well fields, \"which are the kind of socialist system inherent in our country\", with green symbolising peace. Thus, they say, the flag embodies the party's goal to realise moderate socialism."
 GXC.midgame.604.a: "An uplifting symbol of human solidarity that transcends millenia."
 GXC.midgame.604.b: "A tragic story about how easily people are torn apart by petty disputes."

 GXC.midgame.605.t: "Constitutionalism Among the Federalists"
 GXC.midgame.605.d: "Constitutionalism is another major pillar of the Federalist movement, though throughout Chinese it has not necessarily been synonymous with democracy. Chinese jurists have had a long, proud legal tradition including concepts such as \"Xianfa\", an ancient generic term for rules and laws before it became synonymous with \"Constitution\", and \"Fa Tong\" (lit. \"law succession\") which referred to rules set by a dynasty's founder which continued to be passed on through generations until the dynasty's end.\n\nConstitutionalism was first embraced in the 1890s by the late-Qing reformists who sought to strengthen Qing institutions against foreign imperialism. They envisioned the Constitution as a set of rules that governed both rulers and their subjects, binding them together. Men like Liang Qichao made a major push for a constitutional monarchy in 1908, drafting a Meiji-style constitution, establishing provincial assemblies and limited elections and sparking decades of debate.\n\nThe 1911 Beiyang Republic began with a French 3rd Republic-inspired provisional constitution which sought to create a parliamentary republic. It was largely ignored by the increasingly powerful Presidents starting with Yuan Shikai, who in 1914 replaced it with a \"New Constitutional Pact\" that made him President for life. Not long after, he would attempt to make himself Emperor. His successor, Duan Qirui's attempt to redraft the provisional constitution triggered the Constitutional Protection War in 1917. In 1923, Cao Kun passed a significantly more liberal constitution, with guarantees for civil rights and blending centralisation and federalism, something renewed in 1929. But in both cases, the constitution was ignored when inconvenient.\n\nVarious provincial constitutions have been drafted in the south, though few were successfully implemented. Still, the dream of a constitutional government lives on, a point emphasised by conservative elements."
 GXC.midgame.605.a: "A lasting constitution is the only way that China can be brought to peace."
 GXC.midgame.605.b: "Respect for the constitution is the bedrock for Chinese Democracy."
 GXC.midgame.605.c: "We fight for a constitutional future, but must be practical about it until then."

 GXC.midgame.606.t: "Warlords, Regionalists, and Federalists?"
 GXC.midgame.606.d: "The third major component of the Federalist Movement gathered in Guangzhou are the Regionalists. While opponents of Federalism have long charged that the ideology is but a front for warlords to justify their defiance of the central government, the reality was and continues to be nuanced. Just as not every Federalist is a warlord, not every warlord is a Federalist.\n\nWhile the idea of respecting provincial autonomy may be appealing to many provincial warlords, building a Federal government is controversial. China has traditionally been a centralist state in theory, even if in practice the autonomy of distant provinces has given rise to the proverb \"Heaven is high and the emperor is far away.\" Federalism, particularly the more decentralist variants floated by Federalist thinkers, is seen by some as dividing the country - tantamount to treason.\n\nMany warlords are ironically nationalistic or at least use nationalistic rhetoric, and ultimately desire a strong central government they are aligned with (if not a direct part of) and see themselves as agents for that government. Others are bound by personal or party loyalty and unwilling to defect to an unproven movement. To them, autonomy is a temporary (albeit indefinite) one, earned by their fidelity during uncertain times.\n\nAmong the Federalist warlords, many sincerely do believe that Federalism is the only way to truly repair China. Befitting of such a decentralised movement, plenty have come into violent conflict with one another - belying the notion of a unified Federalist front. Federalist ideas have been incorporated into other factions as well, further muddying the waters.\n\nAmong Chen Jiongming's government, not all of them are interested in fighting a war in the name of Federalism. Many Cantonese figures follow Chen due to personal ties while many warlords obey him due to his dominance over the south, but see little benefit in waging an offensive war."
 GXC.midgame.606.a: "May Chen Jiongming preserve the peace at home."
 GXC.midgame.606.b: "We hope that Chen Jiongming continues to respect our autonomy."

 GXC.midgame.607.t: "The Conference Closes"
 GXC.midgame.607.d: "As the Guangzhou Federalist Conference comes to a close, it is clear that the Federalist movement rests on three pillars: Democracy, Constitutionalism, and Regionalism. For the idealistic democrats, the Guangzhou Federalist Government is their chance to finally achieve some semblance of representative democracy in China. For the Constitutionalists, they are pinning their hopes on Chen Jiongming, a lawyer and long-time member of the Guangdong Provincial Assembly, to implement and respect a constitution once in power. For the regionalists, Federalism will ensure the voice of the locals will not be drowned out on a national level.\n\nThe Federalist movement has a spectrum of figures, some extremely vocal about their ideals while others much more pragmatic in their dealings. At the end of the day however, the new Guangzhou Federalist Government is expected to operate more or less the same way the old Guangdong government did. Chen Jiongming has gone from Governor to President after a conference vote with little opposition, the aging Cantonese businessman and revolutionary Chen Xiru (his de facto deputy) will likely become Governor of Guangdong.\n\nWhile the Conference continues to try and define Federalism, beneath the varnish the government is held together by the might of the Yue Army, the Guangzhou bureaucracy, and aligned gentry magistrates. Like most warlords, Chen Jiongming is the indispensable centre of a web of personal connections and though he tries to cloak it with local assemblies and parliamentary process (whether for benevolent or manipulative reasons is up to interpretation), his word ultimately is the last one.\n\nStill, that probably is still better than many warlords in China. And with how easily the theorists and thinkers are distracted or become out of touch with the reality on the ground, perhaps a strong hand is what is needed to keep the movement together and moving forward."
 GXC.midgame.607.a: "The magistrates and bureaucrats are what keep Guangdong going."
 GXC.midgame.607.b: "The Yue Army and its officers keep the various warlords in line."

 ##Narrative Event Chain (620-639)
 GXC.midgame.620.t: "Chen Xiru Passes Into the Night"
 GXC.midgame.620.d: "Though elected Governor by the Guangdong Provincial Assembly shortly after Chen Jiongming was sworn in as President of the Guangzhou Federalist Government, Chen Xiru never had the chance to take up the post. The elderly Cantonese gentleman passed away last night after a long battle with illness, having spent his last energies aiding Guangdong's reconstruction.\n\nChen Xiru was the heir to a wealthy overseas Chinese trader, and after growing up in Guangdong he started school in Hawaii before attending Yale. While in America, he became classmates with Sun Yat-sen and a friend of Tang Shaoyi, two men whose paths he would continue to cross into the Xinhai Revolution. He and his brother Chen Gengyu inherited his father's business empire, and they used it to sponsor various political factions in the new Republic.\n\nWell respected within Cantonese circles, Chen Xiru was appointed by Chen Jiongming as civilian governor during the June 16th incident. His tenure was brief, and he fled into exile with Chen Jiongming to Hong Kong. Disillusioned, he nevertheless stuck by Chen in the name of protecting Guangdong. His elder son Chen Yongshan was also a Yale graduate and he served in the Yue Army, becoming director of Shijing Arsenal. In 1924, he was assassinated by a sniper in Macau. Chen's empire will likely be inherited by his surviving children.\n\nWho will take his place as Governor of the Federalist government's most vital province is now an open question. With the DSP lacking the institutional power to run a credible campaign, President Chen is expected to nominate and easily get elected an insider. Vying for the job are two of his secretaries. Ma Yuhang has experience in diplomacy and finance, and is seen as the favourite of the Yue Army. Chen Qiyou has been tasked with organising the PIP. Less popular candidates include Qiu Jingyun, Chen Jiongming's advisor Chen Gongshou, a merchant leader seen as Chen Lianbo's proxy."
 GXC.midgame.620.a: "Ma Yuhang is one of Chen's older, better established protégés."
 GXC.midgame.620.b: "Chen Qiyou is younger and has more ties with the GRA."
 GXC.midgame.620.c: "Qiu Jingyun was the President's own mentor and continued counsel."
 GXC.midgame.620.e: "Chen Gongshou would allow an outside voice while keeping matters in house."

 GXC.midgame.621.t: "Chen Jiongming's Men"
 GXC.midgame.621.d: "Chen Jiongming commanded a wide range of friends, allies, and personal connections - something that has propped up his government and given life to his Federalist movement. But even as more join and his government expands, his core support network remains largely the same.\n\nAt the centre of his powerbase is his control over the Yue Army. The successor of his Xun Army (named after Huizhou), the Yue Army has evolved to something more than just a military force. Many of his top officers were also among his earliest followers, and their fidelity over the decades has given him a degree of security others lack. Of course, their loyalty has not been without question. While officers like Ye Ju and Ma Yuhuang, stood by Chen to the bitter end, officers like Xiong Lue, Weng Shiliang, Luo Xianxiang, and brothers Zhong Xiunan and Jingtang were willing to seek employment elsewhere.\n\nAnd loyalty does not preclude independent action - after the June 16th Incident Chen Jiongming claimed the coup was plotted without his involvement: a dubious claim but supported to an extent by his multiple \"retirements\" where he would leave his army and they would operate seemingly without his direct management. Men like Hong Zhaolin, Yang Kunru, and Huang Dawei either were independent warlords to begin with or set up their own fiefdoms under him.\n\nChen Jiongming's civilian allies are similarly diverse, though virtually all of them share roots in the \"Haifeng Clique\" of early Chen Jiongming disciples from his home county. The various gentrymen (including his blood relatives) who backed Chen, such as Qiu Jingyun and Chen Yuebo, formed the Grain Industry Maintenance Association which has expanded as Chen's influence did. Various students that Chen organised in his early days like Chen Qiyou and Chen Yansheng, with the help of Hongmen and diaspora connections, have evolved into the Public Interest Party - an attempt at creating a modern political party to advance the Federalist movement."
 GXC.midgame.621.a: "The Yue Army will always be first and foremost."
 GXC.midgame.621.b: "The Public Interest Party will be Chen's legacy."
 GXC.midgame.621.c: "Chen was born a gentryman-scholar, and remains one."

 GXC.midgame.622.t: "The Makeup of the DSP"
 GXC.midgame.622.d: "The Democratic Socialist Party traces its roots (as do most non-Kuomintang, reformist parties) to the teachings of Liang Qichao, the late Qing dynasty reformist and Beiyang founding father. Some older members also are drawn from the various exile study associations at the turn of the century; many were former Political Science Clique affiliated moderates like Xu Fulin and Lin Zhengxuan.\n\nAt its centre is Zhang Junmai, a Liangist educated in Germany (where he first was inspired by the German SPD), and who has tried to consolidate power within the party around himself. Ideologically he has attempted to synthesise Eastern philosophy with Western political ideas (particularly Social Democracy), to limited effect.\n\nZhang views the party more as an intellectual elite (the successor to his National Renaissance Society) than a mass movement, hoping to influence policy through connections to intellectuals and warlords. The NRS's mission was to awaken China's national consciousness, harmonise society, and allow for the free development of the individual through the power of the nation and they have a history of collaborating with warlords like Sun Chuanfang, Chen Jiongming, and now they are said to be courting various regional warlords under Chen. Zhang also had a brief dialogue with the Young China Party (another Liangist splinter group) leaders such as Li Huang and Zeng Qi in the 1920s.\n\nHis fears of becoming a mere armchair intellectual and his authoritarian efforts to control his party has caused many of his peers to resent him and the party to shrink to mostly himself, his students, and a support base of foreign trained educators and middle-age moderates. Liberals like Luo Longji and socialists like Zhang Dongsun have bemoaned this trend, hoping for the DSP to adopt a more grass-roots friendly approach to propagating their beliefs. They have sought to capitalise on anti-concessionist trends, with leaders such as Zhu Qinglan and Luo Wengan speaking out against Japan and Germany."
 GXC.midgame.622.a: "Zhang Junmai, like Liang before him, is the movement's guiding hand."
 GXC.midgame.622.b: "By educating the warlords, the DSP can concretely influence policy."
 GXC.midgame.622.c: "A modern party requires mass appeals to nationalism and socialism."
 GXC.midgame.622.e: "The DSP's wide range of connections allows it to build a working coalition."

 GXC.midgame.623.t: "Old vs New Federalists"
 GXC.midgame.623.d: "The Federalist movement can be broadly divided into two groups of factions, those mostly founded and active prior to the Zhili unification and those whose mindsets were molded afterwards.\n\nThe original federalist movement active in the early 1920s was shaped by the civil war and the seemingly intractable divide between North and South. With the provinces drifting apart from one another and with no military unification in sight, the emphasis of this early phase of Federalism was on finding a diplomatic solution to the crisis. Federalism in this era was focused on bringing constitutional democracy locally, with the aspiration of the provinces reuniting through a negotiated federation.\n\nThe Zhili's successful unification after the Northern Expedition changed that calculus, and with national reunification no longer in doubt (at least on paper) and the Cao Kun constitution promising a federal division of power and democratic reforms (also on paper), the later Federalist movement shifted towards liberalising Beiyang on a national level. Regionalism began to be heavily criticised as unpatriotic amid threats of foreign imperialism and synonymous with the warlord era, causing the provincial autonomy aspect of Federalism to be de-emphasised in favor of implementing democracy and constitutionalism.\n\nThe PIP and DSP were both founded after 1928, and their leaders were active in both eras of the Federalist movement. However, Chen Jiongming and his allies are more tied down to the powers that be and are more regionally based, causing the PIP to appeal more towards the first camp. For Zhang Junmai and his allies, their lack of institutional power and the geographic dispersal of their members has seen the DSP trend towards the latter. They also have a freer hand in calling for radical changes to the socio-economic system since they are not weighed down by the practical realities of ruling. Both sides are expected to find additional allies as the Federalist government expands."
 GXC.midgame.623.a: "The Old Federalists stay true to the original purpose of the movement."
 GXC.midgame.623.b: "The New Federalists reflect changing values among Chinese intellectuals."

 GXC.midgame.624.t: "Finding Funding for the DSP"
 GXC.midgame.624.d: "While socialists have long dreamed of a society that no longer needs money to function, at least for this era the DSP will need funding to survive. Scraping together a living has always been a concern for the intellectual class; they often had to be either independently wealthy, prolific and famous enough as writers to gain a decent following or most likely receive the patronage of powerful people. As a consequence, political newspapers in China have frequently sprouted up and ceased publication as political tastes change.\n\nBeing an intellectual(s) publishing a (likely transient) newspaper is one thing, but being an organised political party is another. The Federation of Chinese Democratic Parties learned this the hard way, with the loose coalition struggling to finance themselves, much less pay for the Federation. Only Huang Yanpei of the CNDCA seemed to actually pay money for the FCDP, with the others being perennially cash-strapped.\n\nThat was during peacetime. With a renewed era of conflict, many intellectuals are struggling to make ends meet, much less pay party dues or purchase party magazines. The PIP is effectively supported by Chen and his wealthy supporters, and the GRA operates as an extension of the PIP. The DSP has become effectively the only other true political party in the Alliance (though various interest groups like the AACSG endure) in part because it does have enough funding to continue operating continuously.\n\nThis is certainly helped by Zhang Junmai's extremely wealthy family. His brother Zhang Gongquan serves as the general manager of the Bank of China - one of the two largest in the nation. His sister Zhang Youyi is also a prominent businesswoman who has aided her brother in managing DSP finances.\n\nOf course, the FCDP was also notorious for taking money from slush-funds from various warlords hoping to undermine the central government. Whether or not the DSP has continued that practice remains to be seen, though Zhang has been seen meeting with plenty."
 GXC.midgame.624.a: "Who would have ever thought socialists and bankers could get along?"
 GXC.midgame.624.b: "There is nothing wrong with discussing politics with local politicians."

 GXC.midgame.625.t: "Labour Issues Linger in Liangguang"
 GXC.midgame.625.d: "Though the Kuomintang and other revolutionaries were routed during the Liangguang civil war, the social and political tensions it caused endures. Socialist insurgents in the countryside have gone underground, organising armed cells that terrorise the local gentry. In the cities, radical unions have not stopped trying to disseminate anti-capitalist literature. Led by KMT and CSP agents, disputes between the workers and their bosses have led to accusations of deliberate sabotage.\n\nThere is some hope for Liangguang to turn to a new page. Many peasants and workers, exhausted by years of conflict, have begun to turn away from revolutionary agitation and accept the status quo. New, more moderate unions and peasant groups focused on solely economic benefits for their members have begun to organise and take the place of their radical predecessors.\n\nBut the healing process is slow, and some fear labour relations may take more than a generation to recover. For many of the gentry, merchants, and political elites independent unions are nothing but trouble and ought to be banned in favor of yellow unions. In better times, Chen Jiongming was able to negotiate with Guangzhou's (predominantly anarchist) unions to resolve a series of strikes in 1922. Chen, while supporting the formation of unions and peasant groups, insisted vaguely that they be a \"labour education movement\" for the time being, which seemed to mean apolitical and refraining from using striking to settle grievances. His government, in return, would help ensure labour and capital remain harmonious.\n\nThough awkward at times, DSP activists have sought to realise their party's vision and capitalise on the KMT's demise by influencing these unions, spurred on by Zhang Dongsun who argued that in addition to political parties, different interest groups must form a civil opposition by pursuing their own beliefs without yielding to the government or each other. How and if they plan to control this energy is another question."
 GXC.midgame.625.a: "Moderate, apolitical organisations will help educate the workers."
 GXC.midgame.625.b: "But politics and economics are linked, and we must organise for both!"
 GXC.midgame.625.c: "Only properly vetted organisations can exist if we are to have class harmony."

 GXC.midgame.626.t: "Federalism in Practice"
 GXC.midgame.626.d: "In 1926, the exiled Chen Jiongming wrote \"A Proposal for the Unification of China\", a book written in a mix of Chinese vernacular and classical styles that sought to outline the PIP's philosophical vision for China.\n\nHe argued that China is so large that it would be impossible to have genuinely representative elections by popular vote. Instead, he argued that organisations rather than individuals ought to be the foundation of China's political system, combining trade groups (a novel concept) with the more traditional representation in government by geographic subdivisions.\n\nGeographically, Chen stated that China should be divided into four subdivisions: the village, the district, the county or city, and the province. Each of the five levels of government would have an executive, a legislative, and judicial branch and the Federal government would coordinate between them.\n\nImplementing this vision has proven more difficult in practice. Chen preaches the need for a \"bottom-up\" approach, organising villages and districts into elected and self-governing committees that could police and tax themselves. However, many seem to follow the letter of the law more than the spirit. Chen was correct that China is quite accustomed to self-governance, but local elections often continue to be controlled by the local elites and their independence makes it difficult for the Federal government to influence them to behave otherwise.\n\nOn a larger scale, Chen's hopes that Guangdong could be an example for other provinces to follow has fallen short of expectations as well. Even provinces like the neighbouring Guangxi have proven extremely stubborn in their ways, with local warlords resisting reforms that inconvenience them.\n\nTrade groups have also been content to carry on as they did, though they have proven more susceptible to influence by the intellectual elite. The slower progress on Federalism has left many optimists aghast, wondering if this is all they could reasonably expect."
 GXC.midgame.626.a: "These things are the way they are for a reason."
 GXC.midgame.626.b: "We must be willing to apply pressure to speed things along!"
 GXC.midgame.626.c: "Change takes time, and patience is a virtue."

 GXC.midgame.627.t: "Four Diseases Plaguing China"
 GXC.midgame.627.d: "Zhang Dongsun's political beliefs evolved over time. Initially inspired by the French Revolution, Zhang believed that civilisations undergo three phases of development. The first was one built on religion, custom, and superstition, which was then replaced by civilisations of liberty, competition, individualism, and nationalism. The third and final would be one founded on socialism and cosmopolitanism, which made society the basis for thought and morality. China, then, was trapped between the first and second phases, but he hoped the \"spring rain of the Great War had germinated the seeds of a new civilisation\", and hoped to bask in the \"sunshine of post-war revolutions\".\n\nZhang began to retreat from more radical strands of socialism in favor of the more moderate guild socialism in the 1920s. Unlike many Western Marxists, Zhang became disillusioned with materialism, viewing socialism less on socioeconomic lens and more as a moral code and cultural orientation.\n\nHe diagnosed China as suffering from the four diseases of ignorance, poverty, soldier-banditry and foreign capitalism. Zhang argued for the need for the rise of a new class of capitalist financial lords (the \"Caifa\") to destroy or reform the warlords and build up China's economy. By this point, he had abandoned hope for a socialist world revolution, and instead believed China must undergo the same economic development the West did.\n\nStill, he hoped that shortening the road to socialism could be possible still, even if there was no escaping the capitalist phase. He believed the workers would welcome this new bourgeoisie as they solve mass unemployment, and eventually this would allow for the formation of a strong proletarian class. This attitude drew significant criticism from syndicalists like Chen Duxiu, who castigated Zhang for belittling of the workers. But Zhang persisted, arguing that capitalism is mutually beneficial in the short term and would help import vital technologies China lacks."
 GXC.midgame.627.a: "Zhang Dongsun's views take root among many other intellectuals."
 GXC.midgame.627.b: "Zhang is hated by conservatives and ridiculed by other socialists."

 GXC.midgame.628.t: "The Federalist Civil Society"
 GXC.midgame.628.d: "A common belief across the Federalist movement is the need for civic groups independent of political parties and the government to represent specific societal needs and influence policy as outsiders. Indeed, the Beiyang political culture traditionally eschewed formal political parties, instead being organised around informal cliques that prized personal connections and individual respectability. Though some political parties such as the Progressive Party, Young China Party and in the Guangzhou scene the DSP and PIP have emerged - unlike Western parties they generally avoided mass movement in favor of serving as social clubs for like minded politicians. Many legislators continue to run as independents.\n\nThis has made scholarly and educational groups appealing, serving as a bridge between politicians and intellectual leaders. With no firm commitments required and individuals coming and going, groups like the Zhang Junmai's National Renaissance Society were able to exert their influence on culture, social discourse, and governance - a tradition the DSP continues.\n\nSimilarly, with many Chinese social and economic elites having ties abroad, the Chinese diaspora wields significant influence. Hongmen Societies funded the Tongmenghui and later aided in the formation of the PIP, in fact the PIP was formally established in San Francisco in the United States. Their exposure to foreign ideas and access to hard currency helps them shape developments at home.\n\nFederalist scholars also speak highly of professional groups. These include agriculture, fishing, business, mining, education, legal, journalist, accounting, medical, and technical industries. Class tensions exist within these associations of course; with wealthier and specialised individuals tending to have great influence. The merchants and gentry have proven to be well organised in particular, leveraging their power to directly influence the government."
 GXC.midgame.628.a: "Our nation's thinkers help open our eyes to new possibilities."
 GXC.midgame.628.b: "The diaspora helps expose our nation to new ideas."
 GXC.midgame.628.c: "Professionals remind us that society is more than soldiers and magistrates."

 GXC.midgame.629.t: "Nationalism and Federalism"
 GXC.midgame.629.d: "Chinese leaders often found themselves trapped between their desire to protect and nurture their native regions with the growing popular desire for unity and nationalism in face of foreign threats. For Chen Jiongming, there was little contradiction in his love for Guangdong and the rising anti-concessionist nationalism in China. To him both were perfectly compatible, and he believed that the provinces ought to have primacy by default, especially when it comes to local matters.\n\nWhereas many of his contemporaries believed the traditional state of Chinese affairs has always centred around the despotic Imperial Court, Chen wrote that the \"totalitarian governments in China's past have been mostly ineffectual; the Chinese people were able to enjoy considerable freedom, and a strong tradition of self-government did exist in towns and villages across the land.\"\n\nThough he acknowledged that human society cannot escape their political and economic environments, Chen argued that traditionally the government mainly focused on political affairs while the people's attention was on their own economic situation. Modern societies have moved in the opposite direction, with the people taking on greater self-government and the economy growing increasingly centralised. Thus, Federalism was simply realising and modernising the existing state of affairs, and he hoped for a utopian brand of internationalism in the distant future, where intellectuals peacefully transform mankind into a new world.\n\nNationalism also played a major role in the DSP, with Zhang Junmai making it one of the three main pillars of their party's programme. Responding to the same wave of Chinese nationalism, Zhang argued that a balance of Chinese nationalism at home and cooperating with the international legal/ethical order would protect China from foreign invasion. They saw nationalism as an instrument for which to transform Chinese society and guide the Chinese economy out of the binds of imperialism."
 GXC.midgame.629.a: "By empowering the provinces, we can build a modern democracy."
 GXC.midgame.629.b: "Through the unity of the nation, we can rebuild China's strength."

 GXC.midgame.640.t: "The Two Zhangs of the DSP"
 GXC.midgame.640.d: "While the DSP was initially founded by Zhang Junmai, Zhang Dongsun and others, Zhang Dongsun and Zhang Junmai have emerged as a dynamic duo in directing the party's platform. While the Zhangs co-lead the party without much conflict on account of their strong friendship, the two men have differing visions for a free China. Zhang Junmai for his part has become a strong proponent of German-style social democracy and Liangist statism.\n\nHowever, Zhang Junmai does not believe that bottom-up democratic reforms can be achieved, rather the Chinese elite must implement such reforms. To him, not even universal education would remove the need for an elite, as politics requires \"dedicated patriots\" and \"a few people with vision\" in order for the nation to prosper. Zhang does believe that whatever unsavory acts are required to achieve democracy will be justified by the outcome, but has wavered on this point more and more.\n\nZhang Dongsun, on the other hand, finds his sympathies farther to the left of Zhang Junmai. A utopian believer of mutual aid and harmonious cooperation at heart, Zhang dreams of a gradual and peaceful implementation of socialism led by a \"Bourgeois Gentlemen\" political class.\n\nThis divide between the two Zhangs has led to many debates between the two, with much of it centred on how quickly to socialise the economy and the degree of inspiration China can pull from the Internationale. Both agree that China lacks a lot of industrialisation or a radicalised proletariat, being a rural nation. However, whether or not that means they should be taking a moderate or radical approach to things is the big question and fellow party members watch their debates closely. Ultimately, the debates between the two Zhangs are led by the different world views of the two men, with Zhang Junmai carrying the social-democratic tradition of the Germans, and Zhang Dongsun the British democratic socialist ideal, fused with the teachings of Liang Qichao."
 GXC.midgame.640.a: "The rural masses cry out for immediate reform against capitalism!"
 GXC.midgame.640.b: "The road to liberty must be walked with care, or we risk falling into the pit of tyranny."

 GXC.midgame.641.t: "Democracy Among Democratic Socialists?"
 GXC.midgame.641.d: "With every passing day, the DSP grows larger as more and more young idealistic Chinese join its ranks. While this is a good thing for the DSP, there is an attached negative. If there's one big thing a lot of leading DSP members believe, it's that the elite should be leading the country to their peaceful reform into socialism. While elitism is nearly universal among the intellectual and political class of China, such an outlook has led to negative ramifications for how the DSP is run.\n\nDespite Zhang Junmai's hatred of the KMT's Democratic Socialism and Vanguardist ways of running things and his numerous critique of warlordist autocracy, he has earned a reputation for being two faced. Much like his mentor Liang Qichao, Zhang has an authoritarian streak when it comes to leading the party, only consulting an inner circle and often making rash decisions on behalf of the party without really getting wider input.\n\nThis has triggered many founding members like Chen Bosheng, Luo Longji, Jiang Yong, Pan Guangdan, and Fei Xiaotong to drop out of party affairs (if not from the party altogether), finding Zhang difficult to work with. Only Zhang Dongsun and Xu Fulin are considered to be Zhang's peers, with the remaining leadership of the party increasingly staffed by Zhang Junmai's students which further enables his autocratic tendencies.\n\nSuch authoritarianism and rule by decree within the party has led to many young members becoming disillusioned with Zhang's leadership, instead opting to instead create their own small organisations or join other democratic parties. Zhang Junmai is faced with the choice to either continue his centralisation of power within his party or start sharing power."
 GXC.midgame.641.a: "As our Party is to become the shepherd of the masses, I shall shepherd the DSP."
 GXC.midgame.641.b: "Perhaps the Party ought to practice the ideal to which I preach..."

 GXC.midgame.642.t: "Chen Jiongming, the Reformer?"
 GXC.midgame.642.d: "A statesman like no other, Chen Jiongming's initial plunge into Chinese politics saw him embrace many seemingly-conflicting ideologies in the name of rejuvenating the Chinese nation. Advocating a bottom-up, democratic, and peaceful political transformation underpinned and sustained by the principle of self-governance, Chen pushed back against the increasingly autocratic nature of Sun Yat-sen, and his burgeoning Kuomintang. Although a man of the people, Chen recognised that others would take power should he not, Chen has rationalised his continued use of the title of Commander in Chief.\n\nIntrigued by radical utopian ideologies from the West, Chen became interested in Propotkin's utopian anarchism. Using anarchist beliefs, he constructed his ideas of provincial self-governance through educational reform and rural reconstruction. It was through educational support that he met Wang Jingwei, with the latter striking up a strong friendship with Chen.\n\nChen only encountered more socialists through his educational work. He sought out Chen Duxiu in hopes of attracting reformist support for his educational policies, and placed him as the chair of the Guangdong Provincial Educational Association. Through his continued leftist alliance, Chen achieved renown as a progressive force. Although Chen Duxiu and Tan Pingshan ended up siding with Sun after the Chen-Sun split, the two men often thought about their choice and wondered if they sided with the wrong side.\n\nAfter the 1922 Coup against Sun, Chen Jiongming saw much of his progressive alliance splinter in favor of the KMT. Despite this, he has begun working with the reformist left including the GRA groups and the DSP following his return. However, a common criticism for Chen's new leftist alliance is that the GRA is a corrupt association tainted by warlords, and the DSP is an elitist club with no mass appeal. It remains to be seen if Chen can wield this new coalition, or see it fall to the wayside as it did a decade ago."

 GXC.midgame.643.t: "The PIP Grows in Size"
 GXC.midgame.643.d: "The party of federalism and democracy, the Public Interest Party, has had a history extending far past its founding in 1925. Its origins lay in the history of its founder, Chen Jiongming. As a young man, Chen pursued a law career, before becoming infatuated with revolutionary republicanism. Founding the Zhengqi Society with his friends, he would preach his political ideals and promote the anti-Qing cause to his 30 students in Haifeng. Chen's political core would remain strong entering into the Republican Era, with many of his allies having their political start in the Aid-Fujian War.\n\nThe Party stands for Federal, Constitutional Democracy primarily, but also calls for the Abolition of Unequal Treaties, Peaceful Economic Reform, Social Progress and government transparency in the name of anti-corruption. Currently, the party is experiencing rapid growth, thanks to the efforts of Governor Chen. However, this increased size comes with an increased need to determine its own identity. Many of the new members are regionalists, who have been accused of using the party as a vehicle for warlordism by the nationalistic democratic wing. There are also quite a few ex-communists like Yan Xichun and Huang Dingchen in the young guard, who are seen as traitors.\n\nChen Jiongming's inner circle has come under increasing fire from various camps in the party for centralising authority as well. Chen Qiyou, his secretary and co-founder of the New Asia League Party, Datong Party, and finally the PIP and Chen Yansheng in particular seem to be Chen Jiongming's chief lieutenants, wielding great power within the party, to the envy of many. Other early followers like Chen Yaohuan and Chen Zhongyue were also early followers of Chen Jiongming from Haifeng. The large number of Chens have led to this faction being dubbed the Chen Clique (not all of them are blood-related to Chen Jiongming, despite their common home), but perhaps more accurately ought to be called the Haifeng faction."

 GXC.midgame.644.t: "Cantonese Liberalism in Government?"
 GXC.midgame.644.d: "After the Opium Wars, Hong Kong was ceded to the United Kingdom and has significantly influenced Cantonese political culture through the intermingling of British and Chinese political traditions. Though the colony lacked democratic representation under its Western masters, the wealthy Chinese elite were able to find ways to influence the local government through economic leverage which also bled into Guangzhou politics. Chen Lianbo and his circle of comprador elites represent the greatest of these mercantile powerbrokers, utilising their militias, political connections and conglomerates such as the HSBC Bank to control major arteries of Guangzhou political life.\n\nIn stark contrast is the Political Science Clique, a middling but present force in the South. With a mixed history developing as an independent strain of the main revolutionary-reformist diatribe, they have made multiple attempts to control successive Guangzhou governments. Maintaining a grudge against Chen Jiongming for his forced deposition of the Guangzhou PSC in 1921 (and the subsequent forcing of the rump assembly to vote him as Governor), their peak of power would be in the 1924 Beijing Coup, wherein Huang Fu became President of China.\n\nTheir influence declined significantly after 1925 but the PSC remnant maintains a significant presence in the North. However, their conservative-liberal grandstanding has left them without rudder or patron in the South. They cling on through the leadership of Lin Zhengxuan, a Speaker of the Guangdong Assembly that was deposed twice by Chen Jiongming - first in 1921 and more recently in 1936. They hope to survive through loose connections, both with the Yang Ximin-Liu Zhenhuan warlord alliance and famed banker (and brother of Zhang Junmai) Zhang Gongquan.\n\nWith these conservative Cantonese forces increasing in influence, both Chen Jiongming and Zhang Junmai are scrambling to find allies in the developing political sphere. The question is, who will come out on top?"
 GXC.midgame.644.a: "The two Chens seal the deal!"

 GXC.midgame.645.t: "The Governor and His Mayor"
 GXC.midgame.645.d: "In the ever shifting political dynamicism of [ROOT.GetNameDef] the rise of the ever increasingly dominant Liberal-Conservative wing of the political science has been a most surprising, and most concerning development, at least for the major parties of the China Democratic League and Grand Republican Alliance. Once at an epoch of his power following his institution by German negotiation in the chaotic interregnum of the Northern Expedition's collapse, Chen Lianbo was \"the man\" within Canton and the surrounding area. Through his clever tact, careful diplomacy, and demonstrable wealth, he was able to negotiate a string of alliances throughout various disparate factions to present a United Front against Old Guangxi dominance in the region.\n\nAfter the 1924 Canton Merchant Corps Incident, Britain and British aligned merchants were still viewed by the KMT as loyal to Chen, even with his absolute driving out of the city, although the exact nature of said ties is heavily disputed. Nonetheless, reigning such contacts in, Chen would recruit the nigh retired Chen Jiongming to defend Guangzhou from marauding warlords and bandits post-Northern Expedition, and yet Mayor Chen would ultimately overplay his hand. Setting up his own dominoes, Jiongming merely needed to knock them down to find himself no longer the servant of Lianbo, but the present master. Or so is believed.\n\nEver on the rise once again, Lianbo has been increasingly favoured by Jiongming for political and financial support, to a degree unprecedented considering recent history. Guangzhou is a crucial city, and as Governor Chen sets forward on transforming the nation under the Federalist project, one cannot forget where it all started. The current situation provides itself as an opportunity: further integration fo the merchants into the Federalist movement, or the installing of direct loyalists into key positions to ensure loyalty and compliance."

 GXC.midgame.646.t: "Chen Jiongming and the Chens of Haifeng"
 GXC.midgame.646.d: "The gentry have always played a major role in Chinese politics, managing and keeping order in the rural countryside and supplying successive dynasties with a steady supply of scholar-officials. Sons of the gentry who successfully passed the examination and became Mandarins were welcomed home with lavish praise and celebration by their village. Even when the Imperial Examination was formally abolished by late Qing reformers, in practice the classic gentryman scholarly bureaucrat ideal never faded, it merely evolved.\n\nIn Guangdong, the sympathy of the gentry to the revolutionaries played a major role in hastening the downfall of Qing Dynasty rule during the Xinhai Revolution. In the southeastern county of Haifeng, Chen Jiongming became their latest favourite son, rising in influence as a lawyer and reformer with his band of Haifeng Tongmenghui followers and being elected Deputy Governor in 1911. Throughout his career, Haifeng has been a major source of funds and followers, and a refuge when Chen was periodically forced into hiding.\n\nThe loyalty has been returned. The gentry of Haifeng have received favorable appointments under Chen Jiongming's rule. The extended Chen clan have often been the target of socialist propaganda - especially from their hated enemies in Peng Pai and his Haifeng Farmer's Association. Of particular note are the three influential Chen brothers who are likely cousins or kinsmen of Governor Chen.\n\nChen Dasheng was an early follower of Chen Jiongming and served as his Director of the Public Affairs Department before being assassinated in 1922. Chen Bohua was a Director of the Guangdong Education Department who later became a newspaper editor. Chen Yuebo was said to be the second most powerful man in Haifeng besides Chen Jiongming. He was the first to rally the gentry to form an association along with Chen Kaiting. As fierce opponents to land reform, their growing influence in the administration has damaged Chen's reputation among the peasants."

 GXC.midgame.646.b: "But surely they could be nicer to the peasants?"

 GXC.midgame.647.t: "The GIMA Expands in Size!"
 GXC.midgame.647.d: "The Grain Industry Maintenance Association's origins lay in the reaction of the gentry towards the Haifeng County Provincial Farmers' Association. Founded by Peng Pai to empower the peasantry and resist landlord excesses, the Association could count its membership in the tens of thousands. At this time, the small landlords of the landlord class who were afraid of trouble and anxious for food had long ago followed the resolution of the Farmers' Association that \"up to three times the rent should be paid\" and collected rent.\n\nWith the rest of the major landlords becoming increasingly reactionary, the county magistrate and Vice President of GIMA Wang Zuoxi, the head of the Defence Corps Lin Douwen, and the reviled gentryman Qiu Jingyun looked to restore the organisation of the Grain Industry Maintenance Association and held a meeting at the county office.\n\nWith Chen Jiongming not only taking control of all of Guangdong, but dominating Guangxi as well, the GIMA has grown quickly alongside its benefactor. With its influence across the two Guangs, the Maintenance Association has come into more and more conflict with the Guangdong Provincial Farmers' Association, the successor to the Haifeng Provincial Farmers' Association. As time passes, more and more gentry join the GIMA, and every strike against the socialist peasant movement yields more and more progress in rooting them out once and for all.\n\nOnly quasi-approved by Chen Jiongming, they have become a political liability as many reformers decry their influence. This has not gone unnoticed by the Democratic Socialist Party, with Zhang Dongsun particularly eager to seize on this issue with hopes of turning the DSP into a mass movement, though Zhang Junmai remains reluctant to damage their alliance with Chen Jiongming. Zhang would prefer that the party play a more passive role in the matter, focusing on urban and intelligentsia support, but this will effectively abandon rural reforms to the socialists."
 GXC.midgame.647.a: "We decry this instrument of gentry tyranny!"
 GXC.midgame.647.b: "Never interrupt your opponent while he is making a mistake."

 GXC.midgame.648.t: "Chen Jiongming, Defender of Order"
 GXC.midgame.648.d: "Many would love to view Chen Jiongming as a man of the liberal world, of dedication to democratic traditions, egalitarianism, and of the Federalist movement. Shaking hands with the landowners, and the merchants, he would find himself similarly attempting to court the anarchists, the socialists, and the syndicalists. Influenced by western ideals of liberal democracy and national federalism, Chen's grandstanding and rallying would find himself a major Federalist leader of the South in the early 1920s, championing the cause as one of its most dominant military-political forces.\n\nIn his experiment turning to the left, Chen made peace with the infamous agrarian socialist and peasant hero Peng Pai and the Guangdong Farmer's Association. Similarly, he offered an olive branch to the World Society, and various anarchists in Fujian; appointed syndicalists like Chen Duxiu to education positions within his administration. Yet ultimately they would deceive him, side with Sun Yat-sen, and work against Chen in 1922.\n\nDriven out of Guangzhou in 1923, Chen would subsequently drift towards the right. Strengthening his ties to the gentry, merchants, and Beiyang warlords, his armies centred around Eastern Guangdong would establish themselves as firm warlords. Aligning with the likes of Lin Hu, Hong Zhaolin, Deng Benyin, and the Canton Merchants' Corps, Chen's restoration to Haifeng would see his allies in the Haifeng Gentry return to power, and Chen's establishment as a force once more.\n\nContinuing to dominate Chen's government in his new era of governance, he has largely been shaped as a conservative reformer, despite all pretenses of liberalism. Whilst not necessarily beneficial towards the morale of his democratic federalist movement, any attempts to tone down the government's ties to its key warlord, gentry, and merchant allies could destabilise his government."
 GXC.midgame.648.a: "\"The government remains dedicated to liberal democracy, as long as I'm here...\""
 GXC.midgame.648.b: "We must improve upon our failures, no matter the cost."

 GXC.midgame.649.t: "The Dominance of the Yue Army"
 GXC.midgame.649.d: "The line of work of a warlord inevitably leads to contention, intrigues, and betrayals. Certainly Chen Jiongming is no stranger to such a fact. Having been a politician, warlord, commander, and statesman since the Xinhai Revolution, he has most certainly seen his fair share of strife. Fighting against the KMT, he has also clashed with warlords such as Long Jiguang, Fang Shengtao, and Lu Rongting. Conducted deals with the most powerful men in the country, such as Duan Qirui, and Wu Peifu. Crucially, he has made strong alliances and friendships with the likes of Zhao Hengti and Tang Jiyao, or Chen Lianbo, closer to home.\n\nThroughout the latter half of his career however, he has scant been able to find truly reliable or dedicated subordinates. But the few he has acquired have formalised themselves into the Yue Army. Championing Chen's cause even in his darkest hour, the Guangdong Federalist's sword and shield has long been stewarded by one Ye Ju; courtesy name Ruoqing. Who stood by Chen when he went into self-exile, numerous times? Ye Ju. Who raised armies and organised coups even when Chen wavered? Ye Ju. And who has stood by Chen in every scenario? Ye Ju. Although of course, there are disputes about how independent Ye's actions have been from Chen's masterminding.\n\nThe Yue Army serves largely as Chen and Ye's political machine, the force exerting their ideological goals upon the nation. Composed of various civilian affiliates such as Huang Qiang, published sociologist and loyal follower of Chen, Ma Yuhang, Chen's secretary and financier who has known him since 1900. Weng Shiliang, mentor of Zhang Fakui, Yin Ji, friend of Deng Keng, and subordinate, later rival, of Hong Zhaolin, or even Zhong Jingtang, one of Chen's oldest friends and an ally of the GIMA All-in-all, Chen has amassed a surprisingly loyal following, yet many fear that his patronage network will merely serve to replace the warlords, instead of moving away from them."
 GXC.midgame.649.a: "\"In a world full of snakes, Ruoqing has been my only friend.\""
 GXC.midgame.649.b: "How true can our commitment to democracy be, if we rule by the bullet?"

 GXC.midgame.650.t: "Deng Benyin, a Progressive Warlord?"
 GXC.midgame.650.d: "In the illustrious halls of Chen Jiongming's close allies, none prove themselves to be more independently minded than Qiongya Regionalist Deng Benyin. The \"King of Qiongya\" himself is not even native to the island, having been born in Datou Village in Guangdong, and only occupying the region in January 1921. Before this however, Deng was a humble subordinate of Chen, becoming a core member of the early Yue Army alongside the likes of Xiong Lue and Hong Zhaolin.\n\nA vigorous, dedicated reformer, Deng would transform Qiongya from a backwater into a middling paradise. Expanding roads, building embankments, demolishing old abandoned architecture and rebuilding forts, he began to promote a synonymous form of \"Federalism\" for the Qiong people. Amassing his own independent Qiongya Clique, his role against the Old Guangxi Clique in 1921 would earn praise from Chen Jiongming. Forming the Eight-Subordinate Coalition Army, Deng expanded his territory into Guangdong following Chen's defeat.\n\nDeciding to help neither Sun nor Chen in 1924, he would play a middle ground, continuing his \"reforms\" within Southern Guangdong. Increasing taxes and the labour service, he would issue currency en masse, enable gambling and opium, issue mineral rights in Qiongya, borrow 30 million dollars from the United States, and found the Southern Guangdong Industrial Bank in Haikou. With all of these additional funds, he would rapidly improve roads, ports, and infrastructure, and even attempt to turn his territory into Guangnan Province.\n\nWith his return following the Northern Expedition, Deng has certainly continued his progressive streak. However, many balk at Chen's support to Deng, considering that the \"King\" is ultimately a warlord in the classical sense - authoritarian and regionalist. Adding ammunition to the guns of his enemies, Chen's tolerating of men like Deng has proven itself an ample talking point amongst the opposition, albeit the removal of such a key ally could prove disastrous."
 GXC.midgame.650.a: "\"He has been far more loyal than any of you!\""
 GXC.midgame.650.b: "Even \"reformist\" warlords are still oppressors of the people."

 GXC.midgame.651.t: "The Petty Warlords of Liangguang"
 GXC.midgame.651.d: "As Chen increasingly relies upon less than sparkling individuals to strengthen his movement, many have come to question the exact goals of the Guangdong Federalist project. Staffed with various warlords of prophetic diligence, or even blatant self-interest, Chen's United Provinces have become akin to a glorified cover for continuing warlord practice. With the likes of Hainan warlord Deng Benyin standing tall with Chen, he has also seen other old warlord allies join his ranks once more, even amongst all of the new friends.\n\nLin Hu of the Old Guangxi Clique has long been a revolutionary sympathetic figure albeit not necessarily a Chen ally. Classmates with the famous Li Liejun and Cai E, Lin would ultimately walk a different path from his former friends. Collaborating with Xiong Kewu and others, Lin would ultimately find himself a subordinate of Lu Rongting after fighting in the National Protection War. A warlord to rival Chen himself, Lin has fought against Chen in the past, but has aligned himself to Chen since his return to power.\n\nSimilarly, Hong Zhaolin, another warlord of his own calibre, has found himself again with the likes of Chen. The local warlord of Chaomei, he was one of the most stringent activists against Sun Yat-sen, and fought fiercely on behalf of his master. Albeit, Hong's privyness to the criminal underworld are far from obscure, and it is well known that he runs an opium ring, with Deng Keng's murder being heavily linked to its discovery. Others of note include the likes of Liu Zhenhuan, a PSC revolutionary with a half-hearted commitment to democracy and federalism, or even Huang Dawei, another petty warlord of the region who formed the United Forces regime.\n\nWith so many petty local warlords attaching themselves to Chen's movement throughout his tenure as a politician, many of his critiques have brought to question if this is merely a pattern of circumstance and pragmatism, or the very core moving factor of the Federalist movement's identity."

 ##UPC Phase III Democratic Enthusiasm Events (660-679):

 GXC.midgame.660.t: "Bitter Realism Engulfs the Movement"
 GXC.midgame.660.d: "There was never one single great event that suddenly caused it, and yet the feeling is almost universal across [GXC.GetNameDef]. That sense of bitter malaise, growing slowly but surely through a trickle of many, smaller incidents until even the greatest optimist has become utterly jaded.\n\nThere were some cases that are easy to pinpoint that led up to this point. Chen Gongshu and his Foshan Merchants Corps being accused of turning Zhangcha village into his own private fiefdom, implementing extrajudicial imprisonments and punishments in the name of their \"autonomous association.\" Stories of local elections being overturned after allegations of widespread fraud, various abuses by the soldiers, and the uncaring behavior of the bureaucracy.\n\nOn a higher level, warlords big and small have begun to dominate the movement - leaving the authority of the central government in question. Powerful elites, whether they be in the government, army, gentry, merchants, or foreigners are openly flaunting court decisions, with the only recourse being bribes or turning to even bigger strongmen.\n\nThe worst of it however, is the feeling that nobody cares. That President [ROOT.GetLeader] and his men are too busy engaging in corruption and hoarding power to bother dealing with the mounting issues in China. That the intellectuals who so proudly championed Federalist ideals are too proud to admit they had been duped. That nothing has changed since 1911, and nothing ever will."
 GXC.midgame.660.a: "Maybe this is how Federalism always was, we were just too blind to see it."
 GXC.midgame.660.b: "It is not too late for things to change for the better, if only we would try!"

 GXC.midgame.661.t: "Infighting Devours the Reformists"
 GXC.midgame.661.d: "Sometimes it feels that every time the Federalist Movement takes one step forward, it ends up taking two steps back. And for the progressives and democrats who once flocked to this movement, [GXC.GetNameDef] is far behind where they should be.\n\nThe exact reasons why and solutions to this crisis of faith remains elusive. And for those looking to the past for solutions, they will find that history has not been very kind to reformists losing their momentum. Even in recent history, neither the United National Construction League nor the Federation of Chinese Democratic Parties had much unified direction in their brief existences, prone to infighting among their constituent groups which doomed them from having even a sniff at power.\n\nThe Grand Republican League Chen Jiongming assembled was supposed to change that, bringing together an alliance of democratic and constitutionalist factions to build a new Chinese republic. But no one seems to agree where it went wrong besides for that fact that for some imperceptible reason it has. Was it because President Chen failed to show strong enough leadership? Or because he was too strong? Was the opposition at fault because of their inability to check his excesses, or because they failed to let the government govern? Are the provinces failing to democratise for a lack of federal intervention, or an excess of it?\n\nThe cracks in the unity of the Federalist movement have begun to wear down the Grand Republican League, and more and more executive decrees by the President have begun to take precedence over the National Assembly. Perhaps more worrying is the democratic backsliding in the provinces, with local warlords and Yue Army military authorities often strong-arming provincial legislatures. One has to wonder if there is anything good in sight."
 GXC.midgame.661.a: "Federalism is beginning to lose its luster among the reformists."
 GXC.midgame.661.b: "But maybe we can bring some of that shine back."

 GXC.midgame.662.t: "Gentry Abuses and the Yue Army"
 GXC.midgame.662.d: "The [GXC.GetAdjective] army of the is supposed to be a force of liberation, and the Yue Army is supposed to be an example not only on the battlefield, but also at home. Their behavior in suppressing rural insurgents have proven to be a sobering reality check for many, dampening views on the movement for many freshly initiated.\n\nChen Jiongming and his men are in many ways heavily tied to the Guangdong (particularly Haifeng County) gentry. Chen was born to a scholar-gentry family, and so were many of his top officers in both the military and government (many of whom are also part of his extended clan). The gentry have helped Chen quickly raise soldiers for his campaigns and maintain his grip on power - through their funds, their well-educated sons, and their control of major institutions. In return, Chen has rewarded them handsomely through appointments to favourable offices (particularly as rural magistrates, which has helped them legitimise and consolidate their power) and protecting them from socialist revolutionaries.\n\nChen, to his credit, has tried to broker a fair peace with rural activists like Peng Pai, at the very minimum for the sake of bolstering his reformist credentials. But in the end there is only so much he can deviate from what is perhaps his second most important powerbase behind the Yue Army.\n\nHow intertwined the two are may be illustrated by the case of the Zhong brothers, both Haifeng-born officials said to be in-laws with Chen Jiongming. Zhong Xiunan is older of the pair and co-founded the Haifeng Tongmenghui with Chen. Said to be an ex-anarchist, he served in both military and civilian roles - including as Haifeng's magistrate. Zhong Jingtang studied at the Seijo School in Japan to become a military officer and helped Chen Jiongming found the Haifeng Autonomous Newspaper. While stationed in Haifeng, they were the target of socialist propaganda, accused of conspiring with the local gentry in a litany of abuses against the local peasants."
 GXC.midgame.662.a: "The Zhongs are good men simply enforcing the law against bandits."
 GXC.midgame.662.b: "Maybe the Yue Army could show a kinder face to the people?"

 GXC.midgame.663.t: "The Ivory Tower and Mass Movements"
 GXC.midgame.663.d: "The Pearl River Delta has always been a relative safe-haven for political thought in China, with various intellectuals and activists who have run afoul Chinese authorities often deciding to flee to Hong Kong for shelter. The formation of the Legation Cities have tightened some controls on free press (particularly calls for colonial democracy and anti-concessionism), but relative to many areas in China Hong Kong and Guangzhou are considered a haven for political discourse. As a result, it was a popular centre of operations for various dissidents like those in the FCDP.\n\nThe proliferation of various newspapers, magazines and other publication companies (although often individually short-lived) suggest a lively political scene. The DSP for example is known to publish the weekly Zaisheng (Renaissance) and the outspoken daily Guojia Shehui newspapers. The FCDP had one called the Guangming (Light) newspaper, while the YCP's Hong Kong branch publishes the Tan Haideng. Chen Jiongming and his allies have been involved in a series of short-lived newspapers, starting with the Haifeng Autonomous Newspaper and the transient Ke (Assent) Newspaper. He also once contributed to the anarchist Minxing Ribao (Fujian Star Daily News) and the Marxist Guangdong Qunbao, though has stopped for obvious reasons. Even the gentry have published Lu'an Daily.\n\nTranslating words into mass appeal is something the reformists often struggled with, especially compared to the more successful revolutionaries in the KMT and CSP. Some of this, at least, has been self-inflicted. While the DSP for example claim their party's objective is to \"awaken the common consciousness of the nation,\" Zhang Junmai has proven hesitant to embrace mass movement like his revolutionary socialist peers. His metaphysical discussions on synthesising Eastern and Western philosophy and spiritual values, while fascinating for his intellectual peers, has done little for his party's reputation as a group of elitists."
 GXC.midgame.663.a: "It might be worth reining in the press before they begin spreading dissent."
 GXC.midgame.663.b: "Maybe it is time we start to broaden our audience to the masses."

 GXC.midgame.664.t: "The Democratic Movement Energises"
 GXC.midgame.664.d: "When the Guangzhou Federalist Government was first established, the gathered democrats, constitutionalists, and regionalists almost unanimously agreed that their goal would be the reformation of the promised 1911 Republic: corrupted by Beiyang reactionaries and revolutionary radicals.\n\nAs the Federalist Movement begins to grow, the unity of the different factions that make up it has begun to fray. For the various reform socialists, progressives, and even some of the left liberals, merely restoring Beiyang is no longer enough. With so many who have died and so many sacrifices being made, they have begun to envision a republic distinct from the old wheeling and dealing that characterised Beiyang at its best. They have begun to demand a democratisation not only of politics, but of society and the economy - a lofty goal for a government that has not even finished uniting China.\n\nTheir calls for change, and change now have begun to clash with the various conservative republicans, the warlords, the bureaucrats and magistrates, and even the leaders of their own parties who often have a top-down style of decision making. For these men, promoting constitutionalism, regional autonomy, and protecting China's fragile institutions take priority and they fear the damage radical change may do. To them, the status quo within Federal borders is what they are fighting for in their quest to unite China, and anything further than that is reckless at best, internal sabotage at worst.\n\nAs the first group begins to gain ground, it has begun to alienate the second, threatening a split that divides even within parties and cliques. The millions of Federalists will need to collectively make a decision sooner or later on what precisely their movement wants."
 GXC.midgame.664.a: "Is not a constitutional, federal republic a dream worth fighting for?"
 GXC.midgame.664.b: "Dare we not dream of a society beyond bayonets and bribes?"

 GXC.midgame.665.t: "Federalist Romanticism Fractures"
 GXC.midgame.665.d: "With Federalism at its peak nationwide, keeping the adherents of an intrinsically decentralised and democratic ideology manageable has become a significant challenge. Hope for democratic change has outpaced the government's ability to implement it. As the pressure and dialogue heads up, the movement has struggled to find a coherent message.\n\nSome early Federalists like Zhang Taiyan and Chen Jiongming were anarchist inspired, with Zhang believing at the time that the national constitution, parliament and presidency were the \"three most lethal poisons\" in China because they would cause China into centralism or endless civil wars. He believed the American and German systems caused endless problems as they continued on a centralist trajectory, though rejected anarchists like the World Society for their excessive nationalism and social darwinism. Zhang rejected liberal democracy and capitalism in favor of Daoist and Buddhist influences and also inspired groups like the YCP and Federalists like Tang Jiyao.\n\nOthers like Zhang Junmai and Luo Longji generally favored the German and American approaches to liberal and social democracy, with Zhang actually being relatively mild in his critiques of Cao Kun's 1923 Constitution. While he felt it to be imperfect, the majority of his criticisms came from its execution rather than content. Zhang believed that authority and freedom were both indispensable and complimentary to a nation with separate spheres of activity. The government ought to have enough authority to ensure efficiency and speed, but the people must have freedom in social and cultural matters. Zhang's most recent quest however, to build a \"third type of government\" that combines the strengths of dictatorships and parliamentary rule has raised eyebrows.\n\nMost, like Chen Jiongming, find themselves somewhere in the middle - seeking a Federal republic with a balance between the central government and the provinces. Democracy, they hope, will slowly be built from there."

 GXC.midgame.680.t: "Li Jishen and KMT Defectors"
 GXC.midgame.680.d: "Chen Jiongming's relationship with the revolutionary left, like the broader Federalist movement, was an uneasy one. His competition with Sun Yat-sen for influence over leftist groups including anarchists and syndicalists left him empty-handed, and he has since replaced those influences with the much more compatible reformist left, particularly Zhang Junmai and Zhang Dongsun. With [GXC.GetNameDef] having seized control of the Eastern provinces however, reminders of his past have cropped up.\n\nChen's early campaigns were in Fujian, where he served as commander in chief loosely on behalf of Sun's government. There he was noted for working with various anarchists, implementing educational, social, and governing reforms. There remains extensive debate over to what extent he was sincere about the alliance or if he was merely tolerating it, and the occupation was not always pretty - with various Guangdong Army officers cooperating with local warlords and engaging in corruption. The MinGan region has changed since the 1920s, having become a revolutionary hotbed under Kuomintang insurgents after the Northern Expedition.\n\nChen's relationship with Chen Duxiu, the future founder of the CSP, had similar ups and downs. Chen Duxiu was an acclaimed educator and protected by Chen Jiongming despite the backlash from the conservatives, however the former ultimately decided to resign. He ultimately decided to cast his lot with the Kuomintang in 1922, denouncing Chen as a warlord while many other intellectuals who were previously sympathetic to him like Tan Pingshan and Chen Gongbo were sidelined.\n\nThough Chen's relationship with the senior leadership of the Kuomintang are beyond repair by this point, many in the centre left have sought the entry of Li Jishen, their leading general, into our government. Seen as honest and on the reformist side of the party, he has sought to facilitate the entry of other defectors like Chen Mingshu and Tan Pingshan, however many see them with suspicion."

##NPA Nanning Conference (800-829)
 GXC.midgame.800.t: "The Conference in Guangzhou"
 GXC.midgame.800.d: "Lu Yuguang has sent out messengers across Liangguang to invite warlords, politicians, and intellectuals to Guangzhou for a conference, ostensibly for discussions regarding the reconstruction of the two provinces and also to discuss national unification. The significance of this act was readily understood by the attendees, who have begun to gather in the city.\n\nGuangzhou is the stronghold of the remnants of the old Guangdong Clique, to host a conference in this city is to assert dominance over Chen Lianbo and his allies. It was also the de facto capital of several southern governments and by gathering southern leaders there it signified his desire to follow in his father's footsteps in leading a rival government in the south.\n\nLu and the Young Guangxi Faction Triumvirate will present their case for leadership, using the two provinces as a platform to unite the southern provinces against northern tyranny. This is a bold play given the North has traditionally won most wars of unification and continues to be dominant. But Marshal Lu will not be deterred - either North and South will unify on even terms or there will be war."
 GXC.midgame.800.a: "Lu Yuguang truly is his father's son!"
 GXC.midgame.800.b: "There are plenty of others involved too..."

 GXC.midgame.801.t: "The National Protection Alliance"
 GXC.midgame.801.d: "A new National Protection Alliance has arisen, seemingly deadset on making yet another attempt at unifying the nation. Led by Guangxi Warlord Lu Yuguang, adopted son of the legendary Lu Rongting of the original movement which sought to topple Yuan Shikai after his attempt at declaring himself the Hongxian Emperor, this new government seeks to rally the various southern provinces into a united coalition against northern tyranny. Who will join them and what type of posturing they will take against their rivals remains to be seen but for now spirits run high in the south."
 GXC.midgame.801.a: "But will they achieve what their predecessors could not?"
 GXC.midgame.801.b: "Warlords banding with more warlords."

 GXC.midgame.802.t: "Lu Yuguang Presses for Unification"
 GXC.midgame.802.d: "Lu Yuguang, the Young Marshal of the South, was straight to the point. Speaking to the assembled delegates, he proposed that the various southern provinces band together so that they will not be so easily pushed around by the Northern governments. This is hardly a novel concept: it was attempted several times by various warlords by internal divisions and the ultimate victory of the Kuomintang sundered these projects.\n\nMarshal Lu has the power to enforce this decree, at least over Liangguang. He is an unknown quantity in the nation, but he does retain his adopted father's name which remains recognisable. Similarly, there are multiple ways towards unification and he may benefit from that ambiguity.\n\nWhile he has declared his intention to stop recognising Zhili authority, this might be a negotiating tactic. Unification by force will be a difficult, costly affair and the formation of a rival government may simply be a ploy to get an advantage in future talks with either the Zhili or another faction. Another lingering question is whether or not he will be able to convince others outside of Liangguang to join him in his quest. Even those not ideologically opposed to Lu may come into contact with his government either due to personal enmity or ambition."
 GXC.midgame.802.a: "An aggressive course of action is our best bet for victory!"
 GXC.midgame.802.b: "A defensive, diplomatic approach will ensure our survival."

 GXC.midgame.803.t: "Reluctance of the Regionalists"
 GXC.midgame.803.d: "Despite Lu Yuguang's pompous proclamation, there remains considerable resistance to war among the warlords in Liangguang. The vast majority of his lieutenants and allies can be classified as regionalists - those more interested in local affairs and preserving local autonomy than fighting a war for unification. War brings devastation, heavy taxation, and political centralisation - none of which are appealing.\n\nThat said, all but the most narrow-minded of them would realise that unification in some way is inevitable and the only way to ensure it is on their terms is by leveraging military force into concessions. For Shen Hongying and his allies in Shaoguan, their decision has already been made. The Zhili and their German allies propped up his rule for almost a decade now, funneling weapons, money, and even pressuring his generals into his camp. Finding a new accord with one of the Zhili Governments is Shen's priority. Chen Lianbo and Guangzhou have a bit more flexibility but only so much. Their autonomy was protected primarily by foreign interests, though with the outbreak of the Second American Civil War, growing Japanese influence in the region, and German preference for the Old Guangxi Clique, they have been drifting into Anguojun circles.\n\nTheir positions on forming a rival government appear to have been made for them - neither has the strength to challenge Lu on making this proclamation. But he would be wise to be cautious about his next steps, because it is one thing to form a government, it is another to begin a war for it."
 GXC.midgame.803.a: "The regionalists flock to Shen Hongying and his clique."
 GXC.midgame.803.b: "The regionalists side with Chen Lianbo and his government."

 GXC.midgame.804.t: "Democrats and Unification"
 GXC.midgame.804.d: "For the democrats in Liangguang, opinions are mixed on unification. Unification will bring peace, which many hope will allow for the eventual democratisation of the government, or at least the empowerment of civilian authorities and the relaxation of restrictions on civil liberties. But to form a rival government and wage war for one is bound to be devastating for the various democratic parties and civic groups who often transcend provincial borders and will chafe under wartime controls.\n\nThere is hope that the possibility of war will shake up the existing status quo and force the various sides to legitimise themselves by working with democratic groups, but the resumption of violence may end up sidelining them in favor of military men. Thus, the various democratic leaders are forced to navigate a treacherous road, demonstrating their loyalty and usefulness to the new government without potentially alienating their patrons in the north.\n\nThe two parties that may benefit the most from this are the Democratic Socialist Party led by Zhang Junmai, who has a few chapters in the north but generally has rebased around Guangzhou and the Public Interest Party which mainly draws its influence from Chen Jiongming's old allies in Guangdong and overseas Chinese donations. While not entirely supportive of any of the major factions, they have the least to lose by supporting the new government."

The delegates, while some expressing reservations about the possibility of war, closed ranks behind him when he declared his intention to form a new National Protection Government.\n\nAssuming his new role as President, he vows to lead wisely and save the republic. For now, the situation remains effectively unchanged from how it was before: the triumvirate still rules Guangxi, Shen Hongying rules Shaoguan, Chen Lianbo Guangzhou. But the elevation of Lu Yuguang from being just another warlord perceived to be a puppet of his Old Guangxi peers to a potential regional, if not necessarily national, leader has been palpable. Wavering generals and military units have fallen in line, various leaders have lined up behind him, and intellectuals have begun singing his praises.\n\nHis first decision will be a simple but potentially decisive one. Moving his personal base of operations from Nanning to Guangzhou would help him shore up his legitimacy but will put him deep in \"foreign\" territory."
 GXC.midgame.805.a: "President Lu will take office in Guangzhou."
 GXC.midgame.805.b: "The high command is based in Nanning."

 GXC.midgame.830.t: "New Tricks for an Old Warlord"
 GXC.midgame.830.d: "In warlord era China, political popularity usually follows military power and Chen Jiongming was little different - his political fortunes often waxed and waned based on his battlefield successes. A well educated member of the Haifeng County gentry, he rose to influence through the Guangdong Provisional Assembly and later as a Xinhai Revolutionary General. He proved to be capable commander and logistician, raising multiple armies in his fights against the Guangxi Warlords and later the Kuomintang. But his fights against the KMT proved to be his undoing and he was forced to flee into exile until after the completion of the Northern Expedition where he carved out a role as a gentry commander aligned with Chen Lianbo's government.\n\nWhen he was bested in battle in 1936, most assumed that would be the practical end of his influence, forced to flee into Hong Kong in failing health. But alas, fortunes have swung back in his favor and his hardworking allies in his Public Interest Party in particular have allowed him to exert influence, pressing for national unification under a Federalist system. He seems mostly harmless but with their power growing, there remain some concerns."
 GXC.midgame.830.a: "Let us undercut his influence the best we can."
 GXC.midgame.830.b: "His views may prove useful for our purposes."

 GXC.midgame.831.t: "Resurgence of the Yue Clique"
 GXC.midgame.831.d: "Despite their defeat in 1936, the remnants of Chen Jiongming's Yue Clique have achieved some enduring popularity in the new order. Much of the old Yue Army and even some of their commanders have been absorbed into our allied military forces while the gentry-backed Grain Industry Maintenance Association that was fairly tied to Chen Jiongming has swapped their allegiance towards us. The Public Interest Party and their Hongmen connections have also found themselves growing in influence within government circles.\n\nOur decisions have allowed a certain partnership to grow with the old Yue Clique, even if at times we need to keep our distance. Continuing to exploit this alliance may open up new avenues for us to benefit from this relationship."
 GXC.midgame.831.a: "Experienced Yue Army officers aid our military."
 GXC.midgame.831.b: "Alliances with the gentry stabilise the countryside."
 GXC.midgame.831.c: "Unity with the PIP and others bring us closer to unification."

 GXC.midgame.832.t: "\"Rebellious Boy\"; the Guangxi Playboy"
 GXC.midgame.832.d: "In the halls of the Guangxi cliques, there are fewer names as convicted in supposed crimes committed against the Old Guangxi Clique than that of Liu Zhenhuan and his Guangxi Army. An early leader of the Guangxi Tongmenghui, Liu would be considered one of the chief representatives of the revolution for Guangxi, fighting in Xinhai, and the Second Revolution.\n\nReturning to fight in the National Protection War, he defected to the Old Guangxi Clique in 1917, but in 1920 under secret communications with the Guangdong Clique of Chen Jiongming, would defect again in-exchange for becoming commander of the First Division of the Guangxi Army. In the ensuing 1st Yue-Gui War, Liu would help extinguish the Old Guangxi Clique for a time, plunging it into the Age of Heroes.\n\nAs a pawn in the broader Sun versus Chen chess game, Liu would ultimately fight for Sun, be appointed as an alternate member of the Kuomintang's Central Executive Committee and Governor for Guangxi, before taking his Guangxi Army, and in conjunction with his ally Yang Ximin, would rebel in 1925 after Sun's death, ostensibly with the hopes of becoming Tang Jiyao's Governor of Guangxi. Defeated, he would be cast into exile in Hong Kong.\n\nAs a member of the Political Science Clique through connections to Yang Yongtai, Shen Hongying, and Yang Ximin, Liu's return to Liangguang politics under Chen Lianbo sparked much animosity from the Old Guangxi Clique; who decry him as a traitor, the second Wu Sangui, or as the \"Rebellious Boy\".\n\nHowever, Liu's shaky resolve and discipline of the 1920s had practically faded in Hong Kong; addicted to gambling and carousing, Liu has become something of a playboy. Charismatic, with excesses, his friendship with figures such as Luo Longji, alongside that of the Yunnan Clique's Long Yun, and his functional role as the face of Political Science within Liangguang has granted him a certain level of leverage within the region, not even to mention the men under his command, or Yang Ximin and Lin Hu."
 GXC.midgame.832.a: "We can hardly demean a man for his troubles."
 GXC.midgame.832.b: "Statecraft is no place for chronic addicts."

 GXC.midgame.833.t: "Western Liberalism in Today's China?"
 GXC.midgame.833.d: "A supportive force in Chinese politics, the Political Science Clique owes its origins to the parliamentary split between the Kuomintang following Song Jiaoren's assassination by Yuan Shikai. With rump members of the parliamentary Kuomintang, those that didn't fight the Second Revolution, forming the Democratic Constitutional Party in 1913, figures such as Zhang Yaozeng and Gu Zhongxiu would come together to practice constitutional politics and consolidate democracy under its banner.\n\nHowever, the Minxian Party would soon fade, with the radicals (Gu, Zhang, Yang Yongtai) dissipating. Following Sun's creation of the Gemingdang in 1914, with his demand for personal oaths of loyalty, the leading members of Minxian would refuse, forming the European Affairs Research Society to study the First Weltkrieg. Staffed by the likes of Li Genyuan, Cen Chunxuan, Yang, Gu, Zhang, Li Shucheng, and many others, the EARS would fight Yuan Shikai in the National Protection War, splitting into factions afterwards.\n\nGu, Li, Yang, Zhang and others formed the Political Science Society in 1916, debating the merits of Centralism and Federalism, Confucianism and the parliament, alongside constitutionalism. The PSS would see Beiyang perform limited reforms, albeit after Duan Qirui's dissolution of the Assembly, they would largely flee to join Dr. Sun in Guangdong.\n\nAttempting a coup, Yang, Cen, Li and Zhang would flee north to Zhili Beijing, and in 1923 would transform from a society into a Clique, joined by Huang Fu. With the Beijing Coup in 1924, Huang would become Prime Minister, with Zhang taking a key place in the cabinet. However, after Feng Yuxiang's deposition, Political Science would survive purely by political skill alone, managing to receive an amnesty by the Zhili once the dust had settled.\n\nNow an Anti-Zhili body, the Liangguang PSC has taken on its own unique nature. Led largely by Lin Zhengxuan, alongside Yang Ximin and Liu Zhenhuan, with ties to Lin Hu and Shen Hongying, it is more militarised, and inducted with warlords."
 GXC.midgame.833.a: "They fought for Democracy when no one else did."
 GXC.midgame.833.b: "Splitters and Traitors, the whole lot of them."

 GXC.midgame.834.t: "Chen Lianbo, the Merchant Prince"
 GXC.midgame.834.d: "Chen Lianbo was born into a silk merchant family and at age 16 he was employed at the HongKong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) while also managing a silk and insurance business on the side. Chen made a fortune during the 1910 Shanghai Financial Crisis, using his HSBC ties to manipulate the gold and silver market. The budding tycoon later expanded into shipping, mining, paper, tea, tung oil, pigs, tobacco, bamboo, straw mats, and other local products.\n\nAmid the 1911 Xinhai Revolution, he and other merchants had organised the Guangzhou Cantonese Merchants Public Security Maintenance Association (better known as the Merchant Corps) to protect their businesses and Chen Lianbo reluctantly was placed at its head. Warlords came and went, and Chen sought to collaborate with them to minimise their abuses though he never quite trusted them.\n\nHis relationship with the KMT was especially sour after they took power in 1922. When pressed to join them, Chen resisted, saying that \"We businessmen do not want to be coloured by political parties. In terms of what is at stake, the political situation is unpredictable. When one party comes, the other party goes; when party A is in power, party B is regarded as an enemy or a rebel. We have a wide range of businesses, and if we join the party, and your party loses its power one day, it will be very difficult for us to move our property and family.\"\n\nWhile initially the Merchant Corps had no political ambitions, Chen Lianbo's ties with the British escalated tensions as he believed their support would allow him to defy Sun Yat-sen and the KMT. He worked to expand the corps, integrating the Foshan, Jiangmen, Shilong, and other local merchant militias into a \"Joint Defence Headquarters\" under his control. He also had contacts with warlords like Fan Shisheng, Ye Ju and Chen Jiongming. Though defeated at the time, the savvy leader proved capable of surviving and continues to be influential today."
 GXC.midgame.834.a: "His wealth proves to be a critical asset."
 GXC.midgame.834.b: "His access to foreign weapons is vital."

 GXC.midgame.835.t: "The AACSG Entrenches Themselves"
 GXC.midgame.835.d: "The Association of All Classes to Save Guangdong was established by Chen Lianbo after the 1925 Merchant Corps Incident, hoping to rally a coalition to drive out the Kuomintang. But before that, the Merchant Corps had older, deeper roots in various Merchant associations that were formed in different cities.\n\nThe merchant class was traditionally looked down upon, but the modern capitalist system has helped them grow in influence. Their role as compradors to foreign businesses and their connections across the country give them a powerful supporting role for many warlord governments. In Guangdong however the Merchants were able to carve out a direct governing role of their own after the fall of the Kuomintang in 1927.\n\nThe Merchant Corps was officially an extension of the Guangdong Chamber of Commerce but it also included a variety of smaller independent groups such as the Commercial Maintenance Association, Dongguan City Business Group and Merchants Groups representing Xiangcheng, Xinhui City, Jiangmen, Shilong, and Beijing.\n\nSome groups had their own unique character. The Cen Zhiqing's Shuncheng Merchants Group was known for its signature yellow uniform and for being particularly vice heavy. After 1925 it survived by rebranding as the Daliang Citizens' Corps under Luo Bangyi. The Huicheng Merchants Association under Chen Dongzhang nominally had strict rules against smoking, gambling, drinking, bullying, and wearing their uniforms to brothels, boats, and winebars but it was poorly enforced. The Ronggui Merchants Group was led by the notorious blowhard Hu Peiyun while the Guanshan Merchants Group were from Chen Lianbo's home village and he hand-selected their leaders.\n\nThe Merchants were often intertwined with the gentry and also utilised charitable organisations like the Nine Charitable Halls as a mouthpiece for their politics, lobbying against joining the Great War, swaying the people, and even intervening in local warlord politics."
 GXC.midgame.835.a: "The power of the business class allows us to get ahead."
 GXC.midgame.835.b: "Their political influence cannot be understated."

 GXC.midgame.836.t: "The Young Marshal of the South"
 GXC.midgame.836.d: "Lu Yuguang lost his father at a young age and his mother (a Vietnamese woman) fled to China where they met Lu Rongting in Guilin. The elder Lu was smitten and took her as a concubine. An orphan himself, he adopted Lu Yugguang as his son. The ex-bandit, seizing power in Liangguang across the 1910s, was already in his 60s during the apex of his power in the 1920s and was eager to begin planning his succession. Similar to northern warlord Zhang Zuolin, he began to cultivate his son as the \"Young Marshal of the South.\" Despite his young age (only 20 at the time), the younger Lu was given command of the First Division of the Guangxi Army.\n\nLu Yuguang was not a very successful field commander, having apparently never attended a formal military academy or staff college. While never formally demoted, as his father's forces began to suffer major defeats against his foes the de facto command of his units began to fall to other generals. It ultimately did not matter as Lu Rongting's forces were crushed in 1924. However, the elder Lu was able to stage a comeback after the Northern Expedition, and with it Lu Yuguang was once again brought back into the spotlight.\n\nHis father had a legendary reputation, both good and bad, and was widely respected in Guangxi. Living up to that legacy has proven difficult, but it seems that recently his star has been shining."
 GXC.midgame.836.a: "Lu Yuguang is truly an enlightened autocrat!"
 GXC.midgame.836.b: "Lu Yuguang is a man of the people like his father!"

 GXC.midgame.837.t: "Marshal Lu and the Triumvirs"
 GXC.midgame.837.d: "The Young Guangxi Faction has grown tremendously in influence as it takes shape and develops its own identity after the death of the Old Guangxi Patriarch Lu Rongting in 1934. Founded as the young guard of the Old Guangxi Clique by Ma Ji (Lu's adopted son), Lin Hu, and Liu Zhilu, after the Zhili victory and Lu Rongting's restoration following the Northern Expedition they became the dominant faction of the Old Guangxi Clique.\n\nMa Ji is the most powerful of the triumvirate, and second only to Lu Yuguang. His father was a close friend Lu Rongting and had Ma Ji declare him his adopted father. A skilled martial artist and a graduate of Guangxi Military School, he served as Lu Rongting's personal assistant and as a field commander of the Old Guangxi Clique. It is said he fired the first shot of the National Protection War.\n\nAfter Lu Rongting's defeat in 1924, he served as Chief of Staff of Wu Peifu's Headquarters and fought on the Zhili's side during the Northern Expedition. His friendship with Wu Peifu began in 1918, where they met while negotiating in Hunan after being introduced by the Guangxi born Zhili staff officer Zhang Qijin. He also became very close to Lin Hu, one of the few other formally trained officers in the Guangxi Army. The two became sworn brothers, and Lin is known to be among the more politically engaged members of the Young Guangxi Faction - having associated himself with Sun Yat-sen, Chen Jiongming, and other ideological leaders. Liu Zhilu is the third of the triumvirate, an experienced commander who helped organise the Allied Forces Office in Zhangzhou along with some Yue Army Officers. Another important officer is Guo Chunsen, a close aide of Lu Rongting with a gentry (rather than bandit) background.\n\nAs Lu Yuguang's power grows, his relationship with the triumvirate has strained. Unlike his father, he is a generation younger than the triumvirs and cannot rely on filial piety. They will have to resolve their differences behind closed doors..."
 GXC.midgame.837.a: "Lu Yuguang asserts his authority."
 GXC.midgame.837.b: "Ma Ji is the real power behind the throne."

 GXC.midgame.838.t: "From a Bandit to a Warlord"
 GXC.midgame.838.d: "Shen Hongying was a Hakka born in Guangxi. He worked as a farmer, earning side-income selling herbal medicines and performing Shaolin martial arts before an audience. One day he and his brother were robbed by local soldiers and Shen sought revenge - killing their attackers before enlisting as a soldier. During the Xinhai Revolution his unit fought on the side of the revolutionaries, ultimately coming under the command of Lu Rongting.\n\nOver the next few years he would continue to rise through the ranks and eventually become a warlord in his own right, playing off different factions before he was ultimately defeated by the New Guangxi Clique. Nevertheless, he was able to bounce back with the help of the Zhili, and his Shen Army Faction dominated the northern part of Guangdong.\n\nThe Shen Army, despite often being bandits themselves, gained fame suppressing banditry under Lu Rongting. However they became notorious for their brutality and indiscipline while stationed in Guangdong, engaging in various vices, looting, and extorting locals. Despite their strength and equipment, they often lost battles due to out-dated tactics.\n\nWith Shen's power on the rise, it might be wise for him and his deputies to clean up their acts. Enforcing discipline is no easy feat, but a truly wise and strong leader is capable of passing such a test."
 GXC.midgame.838.a: "Shen is a great leader, and great leaders discipline their men."
 GXC.midgame.838.b: "A truly wise leader knows when to trust his soldiers."

 GXC.midgame.839.t: "Zhu Jiahua, the Grey Eminence"
 GXC.midgame.839.d: "Zhu Jiahua was a student in the Tongji School in Shanghai, a university founded and funded by Germans. He joined a Dare-to-Die Squad during the Xinhai Revolution in 1911 before continuing his electrical engineering education at Tongji. Afterwards he won a scholarship to study metallurgy in Berlin where after some disruptions from the Great War, he completed his PhD. He became a prominent German-educated Professor in Peking University before leaving Beijing after the brutal suppression of the March 18th Protests in 1926 by the Fengtian Clique.\n\nAfterwards he went southwards where he taught at Guangdong University and briefly worked in the KMT government but refused to join the party. He proved to be a successful intermediary after the German seizure of Guangzhou, allowing him to play an important role in Chen Lianbo's government before seeking a position under Sun Chuanfang. He joined Li Linsi's budding Jingxing Society, which began as a vehicle for Sino-German Cultural Exchanges but developed into a political movement to improve Sino-German ties and promote Chinese modernisation along German lines.\n\nAfter the brutal suppression of the 1932 Shanghai Uprisings, Zhu resigned from the Sun government and returned to Guangzhou. Influential within Sino-German circles, the ascendant Shen Hongying has hired him as an advisor. But Zhu is a crafty and ambitious man of his own, and many believe that he is the true mastermind behind the previously shambling Shen Army's rise."
 GXC.midgame.839.a: "Zhu dedicates his efforts to improving Shen's image."
 GXC.midgame.839.b: "Zhu leverages his contacts to bolster Shen's position."

 GXC.lategame.000.d: "A most brazen display of dedication to the nation has emerged from Guangxi Province as of recent. Reflecting the nation's war situation with Japan, a gathering of students has formed in order to create the \"Guangxi Xueshengjun\", or Guangxi Student Army. Emboldened by patriotism and pride, the student body of roughly 300 male and female university and senior highschool aged participants have begun to propagate propaganda to the soldiers and local civilian population, usually in the form of patriotic speeches and plays, evoking national struggle. Celebrating recent victories, certain Guangxi officers within the command corps have cited the student movement as \"the first step towards paving the way for national regeneration\".\n\nHowever, many young and particularly left wing students have joined the ranks of the growing Student Army, resulting in a differing of attitude and splitting of both ranks and overall message. Propaganda has begun to shift from focusing on the War of National Resistance to that of Liberation of the Chinese proletariat from the World's Imperialists, and as a result has run under much contension with certain elements of the administration. Keen to direct the students away from interfering in politics, vocal hardliners propose shutting down the army entirely, stipulating that propaganda is the role of the military and government. Nonetheless, such a move could dampen morale significantly, or even incite retribution."

To counter this a plan has been put forward on relocating the denizens of Haikou and Qionghai to the Wuzhi mountains, located in central Qiongya, in order to provide a safe haven from any coastal invasion. Albeit such a proposed plan has been met with much contension by the local populace.\n\nThe ethnic Li population have become invigorated into an uprising over such a proposal due to fears of Han dominance in the region becoming a more apparent threat to their way of life and culture. The core ringleader of the uprising is one Wang Guoxing, leader of a local Li Village in Qiongya. Largely staffed by his family, the rebellion is evidently built on the unbreakably strong ties of village to village.\n\nWith matters of national security at stake, members of the government have advocated for a particularly hardline response, some even suggesting the planned execution of thousands of Li villagers in order to quell the uprising. Balking at such a heavy-handed and brutal idea, many in the fierce opposition have instead insisted upon the necessary investments made into the protection of Li culture, and the local area. Ultimately their proposals have been met with counter arguments that such frivolous spending would deprive necessary materiel for the war effort."

The Fujian and Qingdao cliques, which are the representatives of the regionalist forces.

Merging multiple existing academies and air programs together as well as recruiting instructors from abroad, the infusion of new funding has not erased old rivalries.

 GXC.lategame.003.d.kmt: "$GXC.lategame.003.d.intro$\n\nThe three major candidates are Lin Weicheng, Yang Guanyu, and Zhang Huichang, all long time Kuomintang members with an interest in military aviation. Lin Weicheng was born in Guangdong and studied medicine in the United States before joining the late Yang Xianyi's group to study flight at the Tuqiang Aircraft Company. He returned to serve as a pilot fighting warlords, becoming a senior NRA air force officer. While in Guizhou, he found himself in the employ of the New Guangxi Clique and is known for his mutually antagonistic relationship with foreign air instructors.\n\nYang Guanyu was sent by Lin Sen to join Yang Xianyi's group. He returned to Guangzhou with 12 aircraft donated by overseas Chinese and aided Yang with China's first domestically produced aircraft: the \"Leshiwen\". He rapidly rose through the ranks as a pilot, an instructor, and a production manager. While in exile in Russia, he continued to study aviation and upon his return he charmed the various Liangguang figures, including Bai Chongxi and Chen Mingshu, and continues to play a major role in aircraft production.\n\nZhang Huichang was born in Guangdong but raised in the United States where he entered the Curtiss Aviation School in New York. In 1918 he returned to China and served as Sun Yat-sen's aide-de-camp, becoming deputy director of the Aviation Department and fighting various warlords. Upon returning to China, he achieved some further fame through his \"saving the country through aviation\" campaign, having his students perform various stunts and personally flying across the entire country in a major spectacle."
 GXC.lategame.003.d.upc: "$GXC.lategame.003.d.intro$\n\nUnder consideration are Chen Yingquan, Xiao Buyun, and Ding Jixu, a collection of foreign educated air force officers. Chen Yingquan was the captain of the air squadron established by the Guangdong Army in Fujian in June 1919, a position he retained after the Guangdong Army established the Guangzhou Government. He was the most senior air force officer to side with Chen Jiongming in 1922, along with Lin An and Yu Baijiong, and was rewarded with an appointment as Director of the Aviation Bureau.\n\nXiao Bunyun was an early member of the PIP with extensive ties to the Chinese diaspora. An ace at raising money for the cause, he entered Chen Jiongming's confidence. He studied to be a pilot in the 1920s while in exile and also was elected the PIP's New York State Chairman. Chen Jiongming invited him to return where he helped organise pilots and mechanics for the Yue Army's fledgling air force.\n\nDing Jixu was a Guangdong native who initially went to France to study medicine but soon chose to go to Germany to study aviation instead. There he married a German woman and found work in Germany before returning to Guangdong in 1926 to serve in Guangzhou's Shijing Arsenal and then as a flight instructor at Guangdong Aviation School. He was sent to study in France in 1927 before returning home to work as a flight instructor for a changed government. Not particularly interested in politics, his fluency in German proved useful amid the Sino-German cooperation."
 GXC.lategame.003.d.npa: "$GXC.lategame.003.d.intro$\n\nThe three leading candidates are Ding Jixu, Feng Huang, and Chen Ruidian.

Not particularly interested in politics, his fluency in German proved useful amid the Sino-German cooperation.\n\nFeng Huang was born in Guangxi and studied at the Guangxi Army Military Academy. Rising through the ranks during the 1920s but never reaching general rank, he managed to find employment in Nanning after the Northern Expedition collapsed, and was sent to the Japanese Army School in 1927. When he returned in the 1930s, he began his career as an air force officer and quickly climbed the ranks as an instructor and later director of the Guangxi Aviation School.\n\nChen Ruidian (Arthur Chin) is a dark horse candidate. Born in Portland, Oregon in the USA, his father was from Guangdong and his mother a Peruvian. Incensed by foreign imperialism in China, the 19 year old Chen went to China to join the Guangdong Air Force established by Chen Jiongming in 1932. In 1935 he went to Germany for additional training and Chen has proven to be an excellent pilot.

 GXC.lategame.020.t: "Changing with the Times"
 GXC.lategame.020.d: "As the Guangzhou Government modernises its military along the lines of the former League of Eight Provinces, new ideas swirl around the officers. German ideas of warfare proliferate amongst the army. Although German officers had only a limited role in training the Liangguang military, they brought along the ideas of Max Bauer, a radical proponent of a totalitarian military dictatorship dedicated only to war. Bauer proposed state planned development of heavy industry, communications, and air transport, proper introduction in the tactics of modern warfare, including chemical warfare. While the government is less inclined to follow Bauer's ideas of totalitarian dictatorship, his ideas of industry development have been quite influential.\n\nIndeed, the Three-Year Plan embarked upon by the Guangzhou Government was influenced in part by Bauer. Officers in our military have been quite taken by Bauer's ambitious theories of warfare. The military has repeatedly petitioned [GXC.GetLeader] to prioritise railroad and communication modernisation. Despite the innovative new direction of the military, it remains to be seen how effective reforms will be. The bureaucracy of China has proven to not be as flexible as hoped, and many officers are still exercising the military strategies of our imperial past, when China pitted barbarian against barbarian. Regardless, [GXC.GetLeader] remains hopeful that China will march into the future against all odds."
 GXC.lategame.020.a: "Large Farmers can be military geniuses too..."

 GXC.lategame.021.t: "Luring the Snake"
 GXC.lategame.021.d: "As China and Japan once again enter into another conflict, it is increasingly clear that this war will be like no other. The Empire of Japan and their lapdog collaborators employ vicious and new strategies of war. Many of our plans have not survived first contact with the invaders. Defensive lines alone will not stall the enemy advances. Indeed, the Japanese have mastered mobile warfare far more than the Chinese military has. We cannot hope to engage the enemy head on; no, we must improvise new tactics for our current situation.\n\n[GXC.GetLeader] has instructed our generals to conserve as much fighting strength as possible, and to retreat whenever necessary. We must now lure the Japanese invaders deeper and deeper into China in order to overstretch their logistics and communications. Just as Lettow Vorbeck successfully evaded the British with limited resources and a weaker military force, we too will seek to outlast a superior enemy. When the Empire of the Rising Sun falters and the opportunity arises, our military officers will launch a counteroffensive and put an end to a century of unbearable humiliation!"
 GXC.lategame.021.a: "China will never fall!"

 GXC.lategame.022.t: "Lessons from West Point"
 GXC.lategame.022.d: "In the years following the failed Northern Expedition of Sun Yat-sen's Kuomintang, the Chinese government in Beijing sought inspiration for new military methods to defeat rebel Marshal Zhang Zuolin and his Japanese backers. In the spirit of modernisation, a Chinese military mission went to the United States of America to observe West Point. Located in New York, West Point was the premier service academy for the Federal Government of the United States prior to the Second American Civil War. Although most officers of the Chinese military mission to the United States owed their allegiance to the Qing central government and the League of Eight Provinces, a few officers were aligned with the Guangdong clique.\n\nWith Qing hegemony now shattered and the order in China forever altered, it now falls upon the Guangzhou Government to rebuild the middle kingdom. Although the United States has now fallen into chaos, West Point is still regarded as a prestigious institution that may very well serve as the inspiration for the new Central Military Academy. Officers who took part in the military mission have been hard at work styling this new academy in the image of West Point, and [GXC.GetLeader] has great confidence that unlike the Kuomintang established Whampoa Military Academy, this academy will train the new generation in the modern arts of war, rather than revolutionary zealotry."
 GXC.lategame.022.a: "What a sad fate for such a beautiful country..."

 GXC.lategame.023.t: "Eliteheer Achieved"
 GXC.lategame.023.d: "Although the German Empire is an imperialist state deserving of scorn and partition, there is much to respect when it comes to the military competence. Indeed, the Chinese military reforms undertaken by the new central government have been primarily inspired by the German concept of the Eliteheer. German military theories are now widely discussed amongst Chinese military circles. Although the government stopped short of Bauer's totalitarian political system, his ideas of heavy artillery usage, heavy industry development, rail modernisation, and creation of modern communication networks have been adopted by the Chinese state. The list of prominent German officers that the military has taken a liking to does not stop with Bauer, however.\n\nLettow Vorbeck is widely respected in China due to his achievements in the Weltkrieg, and Heinz Guderian's ideas of Blitzkrieg have been quite intriguing although armour technologies in China have yet to match our more powerful neighbours. The up and coming star of German officers stationed in the far east Erwin Rommel has also caught the attention of many in our military. Indeed, many generals are attempting to emulate his command style to earn the nickname 'Rommel of the East.' The most influential German officer in China though, has been Hans Von Seeckt. His book 'Edanken Eines Soldaten' (The Thoughts of a Soldier) is very popular and quoted all the time in military circles in China. These reforms are just the beginning, China will continue the drive towards modernity, spearheaded by the Chinese Wehrmacht!"
 GXC.lategame.023.a: "The Empire of the Rising Sun has a new rival in the East..."

 GXC.lategame.024.t: "Surpassing Beiyang"
 GXC.lategame.024.d: "Though ultimately a gross failure of China's earlier attempts of modernisation, the idea of a modern central army was not flawed conceptually. Today, with a nation in pieces and regionalist warlords seizing control of far flung provinces, it has become all the more important that the Central Government wield an army superior to provincial forces, and knowledgeable of modern military tactics.\n\nWith the fall of the Beijing Government of the Great Qing, it now falls to the Guangzhou Government to pick up the mantle of Beiyang and establish a new central army, powerful enough to keep the warlords in check, foreign invaders at bay, and spearhead military modernisation. With years of military reform and experimental tactics, the new Central Government has finally achieved that which the Beiyang Government could not. Despite our lack of German aid and economic collapse in all provinces due to the chaos of the League collapse and Black Monday, the Guangzhou Government triumphs through all obstacles.\n\nThe Chinese military and government must not grow complacent at the current success we have seen in the preceding years, for the climb back to world prominence is a long one and threats internal and external still exist and await an opportune moment to return the middle kingdom to the state of weakness it was in during the height of the Warlord Era. Let these threats come and test themselves against the New Model Army of the Republic, heir and supplanter of the National Revolutionary and Beiyang Armies!"
 GXC.lategame.024.a: "Yuan and Sun walked so we could run."

 GXC.lategame.025.t: "The Dragon and the Eagle"
 GXC.lategame.025.d: "Even though the United States of America has been plunged into chaos in the aftermath of the Elections of 1936, it remains a role model to many in China, including but not limited to Chen Jiongming, Wu Peifu, and Sun Yat-sen. Indeed, the United States service academy of West Point has been a great inspiration to the Central Military Academy. Just as West Point has trained many great officers with internalised republican virtue, so too has the Central Military Academy. Much like the United States Military before General MacArthur, the Republic of China Armed Forces swears to not interfere with the politics of the nation, acting as simply the apolitical guardians of the republic.\n\nThese military reforms have seen much success in our efforts during the Second Sino Japanese War and against warlord rebels. The Japanese came in, expecting a weak military to simply knock down and humiliate. Instead, they faced a modernised military, one which has loyalty not to a single political party or individual, but the nation itself. Where warlords expected a self-serving military force that would be content with its own slice of China, they face a nationalist force committed to total unification and an end to warlord exploitation of the common folk. No longer will China be restrained by selfish opportunists from within and foreign vultures, China will walk amongst the free nations of the world!"

 #- Guangxi Style Events (030-039)

 GXC.lategame.030.t: "A Return to Warfare of Old"
 GXC.lategame.030.d: "Finally, after an interregnum spanning nine hundred years and a multitude of dynasties, the Chinese soldier now finally practices the Chinese way of waging war. All across the nation, the soldier and peasant act as one organism functioning in symbiosis. In peacetime, the Chinese citizen tends to their occupation, to their family, to their livelihood, and in war the same citizen will take up arms to defend their nation and community. No longer is the soldier class derided as the rowdy, unintelligent brute no better than a bandit, but instead seen as a core component of average Chinese society. One does not need to look far to see the merit in the integration of the militia system, as our staggering national rise could not have been done without the loyalty and ferocity exhibited by the militia, striking deep into the enemy no matter their size.\n\nWith the new reforms of the military and citizenry in our hand, the Chinese nation is sure to never fall to the crippling weakness and exploitation it endured during the decline of the Qing, instead a new era has dawned on the Middle Kingdom, a phoenix from the ashes destined for greatness. With the militia ensuring perfect efficiency, cohesion and mutual respect throughout our nation, no one can doubt the new era will see China return as a dominant world power."

 #- Legacy of Whampoa Events (040-049)

 GXC.lategame.040.t: "Our Hearts and Souls"
 GXC.lategame.040.d: "Ever since the matchstick of Xinhai was struck all those years ago, the ever burning fire of the republican revolutionary cause has forever remained lit in China. From Kuomintang to Federalist, Zhili to Fengtian and all inbetween, there have always been individuals placing their very lives on the line to fight back against the tyrannical structure of previous dynasties. Once again, like a moth to a flame, these individuals have answered the call to arms rang throughout the nation, excelling above and beyond their contemporaries in a cause they truly are devoted to.\n\nThis statement is not any more exemplified in the waves of devout, loyal and fierce cadres produced by our Whampoa academy, striking deep into the heart of all whomst oppose the liberation of the Chinese people. Utterly loyal and without contemporaries, the soldiers of our armies march ever onwards to the bright future dawning on the nation, forever loyal and unquestioning to the revolutionary cause. The revival of Whampoa has brought the Chinese army onto the forefront of the world's armies, and never again shall a century of humiliation befall their people, for the very fire of the revolutionary cause burns furiously in every soldier, never to be doused."

 ##KMT Unique Military Events (050-099)

 GXC.lategame.050.t: "Dongjiang River Column"
 GXC.lategame.050.d: "With the Second Sino Japanese War in full swing, a conflict likely to surpass the brutality of the first war, the Chinese nation must prepare all measures necessary to defend its sovereignty against the harbinger of imperialism in Asia. As China is unable to fight the Japanese man for man due to their technological superiority, the National Government has engaged in a strategy of Guerilla warfare, where the military is to utilise the land and China's home field advantage against the enemy.\n\nFollowing the Central Government's example, [GXC.GetLeader] has created the Dongjiang Column of the Guangdong People's Anti-Japanese Guerilla force. Led by Gu Dacun, Zeng Sheng, and Wang Zuoyao and comprising upwards of ten thousand partisans, this guerilla force will help push the Japanese invaders out of Guangdong. Already, the soldiers of the Dongjiang have assisted in defending China by eliminating Japanese strongholds along the Guangzhou-Kowloon railway, as well as defending the Shenzhen river. If China is to defeat Japan in this final hurdle to secure the National Revolution, we will need many more forces like the Dongjiang Column."
 GXC.lategame.050.a: "Our time will come!"
 GXC.lategame.050.b: "But not yet."

 GXC.lategame.051.t: "Money and Muscle"
 GXC.lategame.051.d: "With conflicts with the Japanese flaming up, the Nationalist government has pushed for more citizens to contribute more to China's defence. Many have described this policy as, \"Those with money provide money, those with muscle provide muscle.\" Few know who came up with the phrase, but many have pointed to General Li Zongren, the so-called inventor of the Scorch Earth strategy. Claiming to have developed it in 1933 during his exile in Guizhou, the strategy revolves around luring the enemy into the interior, stripping the countryside of anything useful, and then turning on the invader with mobile and guerilla tactics.\n\nIn following the Nationalist government wartime policy to increase the size of the army, families of soldiers were generally provided for by villages by government decree. 1937 Regulations also stipulated that if a dependent of a soldier had no one to look after their affairs, the village head could with permission of the soldier appoint a proxy. On top of that, The local official was required to supply labour assistance to dependents during planting and harvesting, without charge to said dependents. Dependents were also exempted from any temporary supplementary taxes.\n\nIf the soldier was a tenant farmer, his household was excused from contributing to the local granary system. If the dependents were illiterate, the local official was required to act as a scribe or provide a scribe to facilitate communications between soldier and family. All children and dependent younger siblings of a soldier were to receive free tuition and were excused from paying any miscellaneous educational expenses at all levels of education. Finally, lump sum payments and ten year pensions were provided to families of soldiers killed in action. These wartime policies in conjunction have contributed greatly to the wartime stability of the nation."

 GXC.lategame.051.b: "But from each according to their ability, not government mandate."

 GXC.lategame.052.t: "The Reserves Issue"
 GXC.lategame.052.d: "While writing his book \"Three Policies of Military Mobilisation,\" Bai Chongxi detailed the historical issues surrounding China's logistical reinforcement. In the past, when soldiers died, there was no system in place to ensure a replacement was sent to reinforce the army. Fixing this oversight has become even more important, now that China marches to war with Japan. Bai has proposed that in the Nationalist government's new militia system, every citizen is to be given basic military training so that everyone has the capability to perform as a soldier and potentially be called to replace fallen soldiers.\n\nThis reserve model has seen great success in Guangxi province, and now Guangxi's military is one of the most well supplied, funded, and capable fighting forces in China despite its relative small size. The Guangxi army helped win many victories against the Zhili and federalist warlords during the second Northern Expedition, despite their numerical inferiority. Due to the success of the Guangxi army, Bai was made the unofficial primary theoretician of the entire NRA, with Chairman Hu giving him unprecedented influence over the future direction of the national military. Bai has since worked tirelessly towards ensuring that this reserve system is not just theory but reality across the entirety of the Nationalist government."

 GXC.lategame.053.t: "Favouritism in Whampoa"
 GXC.lategame.053.d: "In light of the recent military reforms modelling our army on that of our forebearers, the legacy of Whampoa shines bright and strong throughout the armies, and its cadets gleam with revolutionary spirit. With undeniable dedication to both the party and National Revolution, Whampoa derived units are heralded as some of the most elite forces our nation has to offer, and receive extensive praise from both the government and public for their military feats.\n\nHowever, this has allowed a steady increase of corruption and rot to fester within our command structure, for Whampoa units have started to receive extensive favouritism by the high command. Personally spoiled by their commanders, receiving the latest and most premier equipment and funding first before all other units, there has even been a report that a cadre of unruly Whampoa cadets with actions worthy of a court martial were merely given a lecture by their commanding officer, and asked to apologise.\n\nLeading the charge against such blatant nepotism, face of the New Guangxi Clique and leading military figure, Li Zongren, has fired a volley of accusations at the government, accusing important figures such as [GXC.GetLeader] of endorsing and condoning such actions. He has pressed forth that the regional armies should be treated as equals of their Whampoa counterparts, and that rewards should be given on merit, not loyalties.\n\nMuch of what Li Zongren spouts rings true, for Whampoa units do not tend to excel in combat much more than the armies of New Guangxi or New Guangdong. Nevertheless, whilst not actively condoning the actions, the current state of affairs had been most beneficial for [GXC.GetLeader] as a loyal army ensured swift progress on the revolutionary front. Unfortunately, Li Zongren's salvo grows louder, and has forced the government to take a stance."

 GXC.lategame.250.t: "The True Meaning of the KMT"
 GXC.lategame.250.d: "With great swathes of China now under the control of the Nationalist government, the Kuomintang must now endeavour to begin an efficient and competent programme for economic reconstruction. While many opinions have surfaced on how said reconstruction could look, Hu Hanmin has recalled a paper he wrote while in exile in Paris to be a guiding theory of the KMT's economic policies. Titled 'The True Meaning of the KMT,' Hu asserts that the KMT as a party of the workers and peasants stood for the interests of all Chinese people. Stressing the interests of workers and peasants, the KMT gathered around it all Chinese in forging a revolution to overthrow the warlord dictatorship and restore political power to the people.\n\nHu stressed that all the Chinese constituted one class of people, who suffered from the bullying of foreign imperialists. Rebuking a criticism that the KMT was a party of petty bourgeoisie, Hu reiterated that the party was the sole revolutionary body representing the interests of all the Chinese.\n\nIn the paper, Hu continued to promote his one-class Chinese theory via addressing the question of the Three People's Principles. He regarded the Principles as an integral set of revolutionary doctrine and asserted that it would be impermissible for anyone to take a certain portion from it to serve one particular group of people. Quoting Sun, 'the Principle of People's Livelihood is socialism and is also known as communism,' Hu concluded that common ownership of property, connoted achievement of happiness by the entire nation, in rejection of Marxist class struggle theory.\n\nNever in his paper did Hu indulge in possible convergence of the KMT and the CSP for their ideologies were so far apart from one another, having urged the Central Committee to move further away from the Syndicalist League many years ago. Of course, Chairman Wang paid no heed to Hu's words, and led the party to disaster. Now, Hu has his chance to fix Wang's mess and follow Sun's vision to the letter."

 GXC.lategame.251.t: "National Finance Conference"
 GXC.lategame.251.d_intro: "With the Nationalist Government establishing the Reconstruction programme, a National Finance Conference has been called. In the name of assisting the peasants and workers, it was decreed that no new surtaxes were to be levied, and surtaxes would not exceed the basic land tax. In light of this, 5200 surtaxes were to be abolished. While this will reduce tax revenue by 49 million, KMT financial ministers agree that it is a necessary step for rural and urban reconstruction."
 GXC.lategame.251.d_sun: "$GXC.lategame.251.d_intro$\n\nThe Conference also tackled the issue of standardisation, aiming to standardise both taxes and currencies in lands controlled by the Nationalist government and aligned warlord provinces. Farming and lijin duty on movement of goods would not be taxed. Leading luminaries including Sun Fo and Ju Zheng plan to account for the lost tax revenue by diverting money meant to go to the military, and have pressed Chairman Hu Hanmin on this issue. The generals of the New Guangxi Clique have strongly objected to these measures, asserting that without a strong military budget, the NRA would not be able to complete total unification, or fend off invasion from the Japanese or Germans.\n\nThe Conference was ultimately unable to decide on who the Chairman of the Central Bank ought to be, although the list of candidates has been narrowed down. The first candidate Huang Hanliang is unliked by many, but is a liberal banker with ties to Sun Fo and is unlikely to cause Hu Hanmin much trouble. The second candidate, Fu Rulin, is a safer choice, being a favourite of Ju Zheng and his Western Hills Clique. The third and fourth candidates, Ou Fangpu and Huang Xuchu, are not tied to Hu, Ju, or Sun, but many suspect that they may be tied to militarist elements in the army, especially Chen Jitang and Li Zongren.

 GXC.lategame.252.d_sun: "Thanks to Boxer Indemnity Funds and Customs Surplus among other things, the Nationalist government now has a tidy sum of money not currently dedicated to any effort or project. Many in the government have already drafted formal proposals for the proper allocation of the funds, first among them Sun Fo, eager to utilise his knowledge as the new minister of rails. Despite his extensive plans, the Political Council of the Kuomintang is reluctant to give Sun funding.\n\nZou Lu staunchly opposes Sun Fo's reallocation of the Boxer funds, as they were originally promised towards the ministry of education by Sun Yat-sen, which Zou Lu vehemently defends as a leading advocate of public education. Backed by the WHC, Zou Lu's opposition poses genuine concern to many on the Political Council. Independent of the squabbling of the civilian government, officers Chen Jitang and Li Zongren have also outlined their plans for the use of the extra funds.\n\nChen, as governor of Guangdong province, hopes to utilise the funds to enrich Guangdong and shore up his administration via the creation of railways, the development of government industries, and increased funding of his provincial military. Chen has enticed Hu Hanmin with promises of support should the funding be sent his way. Many on the Political Council have denounced Chen for his regionalist tendencies, perhaps the only thing Sun and Zou can agree on.\n\nLi Zongren has proposed that all of the funds go towards the National Revolutionary Army, as unification is far from over. Li argues that money spent on anything will be a waste as future wars will disrupt those efforts anyways. While the Political Council remains unimpressed with both Chen and Li's proposals, they do recognise the considerable military influence both men possess, and are hesitant to have two enemies with control of the army. In the end, the decision falls to [GXC.GetLeader] to break the deadlock and choose where the funds shall go."

 GXC.lategame.253.d_sun: "Although Sun Fo gained great influence in the government after being appointed as the minister of rails, he was still a new face at the head of a new ministry in the Nationalist Government. Unlike Zou Lu, Sun was not respected by the party despite his familial lineage, or perhaps in spite of it. In order to make a name for himself, Sun Fo has taken it upon himself to dedicate his full energies to his ministry in order to establish it as a force to be reckoned with, as well as expanding his influence in the Nationalist government.\n\nOn top of his responsibilities regarding China's rails, Sun was also tasked with creating a government airway company. Sun purchased four planes from the American-owned Curtis-Wright company and formed the Chinese National Aviation Corporation, and was made president. On top of being president of the CNAC and minister of rails, Sun also negotiated with Curtis-Wright for an airmail service between the major cities of China, including Shanghai, Wuhan, Nanjing, Beijing, and Guangzhou.\n\nHowever in doing so, Sun gained the ire of the communications ministry. Wang Boqun, the minister of communications, sued Sun for overreaching with his authority and encroaching on their domain. Wang also pushed for his ministry to be renamed the Ministry of Communications and Transportation. In the end, the Chinese Supreme Court sided with the communications ministry against Sun, forcing him to relinquish his position of president of the CNAC to Wang."
 GXC.lategame.253.d_nosun: "Without the overt leadership of \"Crown Prince\" in Right Kuomintang Party politics, his reconstruction faction, split on two halves, has found itself playing politics with one arm behind its back. With accusations of being traitors, or Leftist splitters, or even plants and spies for Paris or Wang Jingwei, many of the Reconstruction Faction's leadership have had to rely upon connections, reputation, and less than honest tricks to maintain primacy. With men such as Wu Chaoshu persevering due to continued service, others within Sun Fo's camp are less than safe from lambasting and denouncement.\n\nLiang Hancao, considered devoutly close to Sun, has received accusations of being but a mere spy for the Paris Committee's insidious intelligence operations, namely on his past service with Wang Jingwei, albeit through a close friendship to Yu Hanmou of the New Guangdong Clique, he has become \"protected\" by Chen Jitang, and namely off limits except for only the most stringent Anti-Socialists. Li Hanhun similarly has folded into New Guangdong's embrace, namely on his recent appointment as Chen Jitang's Chief of Staff, albeit has gained the respect of even Li Zongren.\n\nMost unfortunately, and most strikingly in the eyes of Sun Fo's reputation, is that of Huang Hanliang. Corrupt, and decried as one of the criminal bankers that sold out the nation to foreign imperialists, he has not found any source of protection from either his own Reconstruction Faction, or that of New Guangdong. Most recently, Huang's attempts to solicit the ejection of Wang Boqun, the minister of communications, from his position has resulted in a legal case against Huang for overstepping his authority and encroaching upon his own domain. Ultimately, the Chinese Supreme Court has sided with the communications ministry against Huang, and it would appear that Sun Fo is no better off for it."

 GXC.lategame.400.t: "The Divisions of 1911"
 GXC.lategame.400.d: "The infamous \"LiBai\" duo has been vanquished, and with the New Guangxi Clique threat receding the civilian wing of the party has been able to breathe more easily. While others stop to catch their breath, Hu Hanmin has remained on the move, cautioning his comrades against the self-delusion of holding onto power for too long. Pedagogical as always, the Chairman has used the recent incident as a lesson about the dangers of political entrenchment, railing against the complacency and corruption that comes along with it.\n\nArguing the Kuomintang must remain a dynamic, energetic force while also having enough flexibility to entertain alternative ideas, he has advised the party to look towards the Anglo-American system. Public servants were dedicated to the people while in office and more importantly outside of it. An amusing turn of events to be sure given his prior opposition to representative democracy (speaking highly of direct democracy) and the besieged status of the Anglo-American values, but apparently quite sincere all the same.\n\nPolitics, however, has also begun to change - perhaps the party is far more dynamic than Hu gives them credit for. The Chairman was long the champion of the civilian right, but part of that was because he was their only shield against the warlords and generals. While still respected, with militarist influence in retreat, some are starting to question how much they truly want Hu to lead the transition to democracy.\n\nIndeed, with the party undergoing significant soul-searching, observers point out the parallels to the old days of the Tongmenghui during the original revolution, akin to the tensions between Sun Yat-sen, Huang Xing, and Song Jiaoren. While Hu very much represents the old revolutionary spirit of Dr. Sun, Western Hills grandees like Lin Sen, Ju Zheng, and Zou Lu seem much more inclined towards constitutionalism, while Sun Fo remains in his own world, dreaming of revolution and eventual democratisation."
 GXC.lategame.400.a: "In the spirit of Sun Yat-sen, we always remain on the move for progress's sake."
 GXC.lategame.400.b: "In memory of Song and Huang, we never lose sight of our true mission: democracy."

 GXC.lategame.401.t: "The Northern Kuomintang"
 GXC.lategame.401.d: "The Kuomintang has always been a southern based party, with Dr. Sun being of Cantonese descent and many of his top lieutenants drawn from Guangdong. This problem worsened as conflicts arose between the Beiyang Government and Southern Revolutionaries, culminating in a decade-long Guangzhou-Beijing split.\n\nSuccessive generations of leadership reinforced this regionalism, with Kuomintang leaders, officers, and supporters often being drawn from southern provinces like Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hunan. The major poles of Kuomintang activity were Guangzhou and Shanghai, and thanks to complicated systems of patronage as well as internal party purges very few Kuomintang members or National Revolutionary Army officers can claim northern heritage.\n\nAs a consequence it was virtually unanimously welcome news to hear that the northern branches of the party have begun to blossom as the Kuomintang's legitimacy rises. Much of this has been credited to the spirited leadership of northern Kuomintang figures such as Ding Weifen and Yu Youren. Ding led multiple secret political organs called the Grand Alliance (Datong Meng) as cover organisations for the party right under the noses of Beiyang warlords, his words continue to carry considerable weight in Northern provinces. Yu Youren similarly carries great stature, described as optimistic, sincere, and forthright. With a powerful build and speech, he carries the \"strength of the north\" despite his older age.\n\nBoth are regarded as elder statesmen in the party, and though their seats on the CEC were once seen as a token gesture of national unity, now with membership swelling from northerners their hand has been strengthened. Broadly aligned with the Western Hills faction, which similarly drew support from northerners, their expansion has met some friction with our southern base, who now find themselves competing for valuable political posts as unification draws near."
 GXC.lategame.401.a: "We are overjoyed of course to finally see the nation come together..."
 GXC.lategame.401.b: "...but we should not forget who did the bulk of the work for this."

 GXC.lategame.402.t: "The Creditors Claim Their Due"
 GXC.lategame.402.d: "Li Zongren may be gone, but the ideas he represented are hardly dead. Li, like most nationalist warlords, had an idiosyncratic view of regionalism, often defending the need for provincial autonomy and protecting their right to a semi-independent army to keep central government encroachments at bay. At the same time, they often bemoaned the lack of national unity and were quick to admonish any notion that they were secessionist.\n\nWhatever the case, their active promotion of these principles has found considerable currency across aligned provinces, taking advantage of Kuomintang regional, provincial, and local level reconstruction and tutelage programs to enhance their own wealth and power. Even as General Li was escorted ignominiously from the Second Congress, few doubted it would be long before another took his place. Indeed, Guangxi is said to have quickly returned to its old status quo.\n\nThey need not look far. Chen Jitang, the Governor of Guangdong, is perhaps the strongest warlord in China and one of the most prominent proponents of regional autonomy (at least for Guangdong). His direct and consistent support for Hu Hanmin and his ostensibly democratic allies has become a liability in this regard, though not quite in the same way as the New Guangxi Clique was. Unlike LiBai, Chen seems to have little ambition outside of Guangdong, even going so far as to eagerly aid Hu and the central government in their march north if only just to get them out of Guangzhou.\n\nRooting out corruption in Guangdong is not as simple or clear-cut of a matter: he does not pose an immediate threat to the central government and in fact has resisted entreaties from other warlords to join them in rebellious coalitions against the government. At the same time, he jealously guards his authority, refusing to allow any central government directives to bypass his office. Most have contented themselves with \"letting sleeping dogs lie\", but the blatant hypocrisy is hard to dismiss."
 GXC.lategame.402.a: "The separation of between national and local government means each has their place."
 GXC.lategame.402.b: "...yet petty warlords and selfish regionalists do not."

 GXC.lategame.403.t: "White, Red, and Blue-Blooded"
 GXC.lategame.403.d: "Sun Fo has been busy in the months since the Second Congress. The victory of the \"Shanghai Committeemen\", \"his\" victory (or so he thinks), has buoyed his political prospects and his followers have been travelling the country canvassing Kuomintang held territory for votes. Sun Fo himself has remained in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], close to the levers of power. He has been rallying support for the party or, perhaps more aptly, himself as he spends day in and day out meeting with new figures and giving speeches.\n\nOften described as quiet and bookish, preferring to stick his nose in a book rather than engage in directionless central committee bickering, the changing circumstances has energised the young man - perhaps the youngest serious contender for power. Drafting a series of laws to public acclaim and speaking out against corruption, his calls for a smaller but elite army and the breaking down of military regionalism has struck a cord with many who fear the large but divided Chinese warlord armies are insufficient to keep China's enemies at bay. Having lost hope of building a strong navy or air force thanks to a growing person cynicism, his calls for military investment in the army (and only the army) has won back some detractors who felt him too doveish.\n\nHis affinity for Western writings, known to be the best read in Western treatise among the Central Committee, once a source of light mockery, has turned in his favour as he now courts younger intellectuals returning home to help rebuild the nation. Similarly, his friends Zhong Tianxin and Huang Shenzhi have formed the Chinese Cultural Association, which among other activities publishes the magazine \"Creation\", consolidating the younger Sun's image as as a young and thoughtful leader who can match wits with elders in the party. Every day, it seems, he comes closer and closer to claiming the mantle he believes his father left him."
 GXC.lategame.403.a: "Maybe it is time for a changing of the guard."
 GXC.lategame.403.b: "His youth corresponds with his inexperience."

 GXC.lategame.404.t: "The Chairman and the Party-State"
 GXC.lategame.404.d: "Hu Hanmin is a peculiar and often mercurial personality, though if there is one thing consistent about him its that he is a strict adherent to Dr. Sun's plans for reconstruction. As a consequence he has faithfully adapted his mentor's plans for a transitional party-state, the Kuomintang being heavily enmeshed into the inner organs of the government itself. Hu Hanmin has strategically centralised power around his office, leveraging his control over the party apparatus to his advantage.\n\nHe has largely eschewed using the title of President (sometimes translated Chairman) of the National Government, seeing that as coming more into play during the constitutional phase of the revolution. For now, he primarily rules as Chairman of the Kuomintang, in part to stress the temporary nature of the tutelage but also as a means of strengthening his own legitimacy. Likewise, while avoiding any personal cult of personality for himself, he freely ensures that the Nationalist government idolise Sun Yat-sen as virtually a secular deity. Day by day as he promulgates edicts on behalf of the \"Eternal Premier\", his power seems to grow unchecked.\n\nEven Chen Jitang, who he shares a complicated patron-client relationship with, has seen his authority diminish as the balance of power shifts in favour of the Chairman, who has openly contemplated having him replaced as Governor now that he has served his purpose. Soon, many fear, the only thing that can keep Hu in check will be his utter dedication to the principles and his stubborn unwillingness to deviate from them - the same stubbornness that has both endangered and saved the party from the warlords. As the storm clouds gather over Chen, Hu's comrades in the \"Elders Clique\" meet with him to make their opinions known."
 GXC.lategame.404.a: "Everyone knows Hu is an incorruptible disciple of Dr. Sun."
 GXC.lategame.404.b: "Power corrupts and sometimes its best not to overstep."

 GXC.lategame.405.t: "Political Democracy and Economic Planning"
 GXC.lategame.405.d: "Last week, Sun Fo delivered a potent lecture called \"Political Democracy and Economic Planning\" a class of the Central Training Corps. Speaking to the young cadres, the extensive presence of domestic and foreign press indicates his desire for an even broader audience. Echoing Hu Hanmin's words a few years ago, Sun warns that the Kuomintang has become too much of a separate caste, too arrogant to hear even honest criticisms from both outsiders and party members.\n\nThe only way to counter this, Sun claims, is for the party to return to his father's teachings and allow full freedom of speech and discussion. To facilitate the study of Sun Yat-sen's teachings and Chinese culture, he has pointed to the recently established the Sun Yat-sen Institute for the Advancement of Culture and Education. While officially funded primarily through private donations, it has received extensive support from the government, allowing it to afford both English language publications like the \"Tianxia Monthly\" and domestic magazines like the nationalistic \"Compilation of Current Events\".\n\nWhile the initiative received acclaim from across the party, Sun's aggressive lecture as well as his growing willingness to challenge party leadership has drawn concern. Indeed, he has all but dared the party to censor the lecture's publication, barely skirting the limits with his criticisms and flaunting his \"Iron-neck\" status. Still, perhaps most irksome was the way he claimed credit for the collective party decisions, particularly as he announced the formation of the \"People's Political Council\" at the end of his speech.\n\nTentatively approved last CEC meeting, it was meant to be a small consulting organ to receive input from political independents (the \"Dangwai\") but Sun has sworn to invite a broad collection of intellectuals and even other political parties for the prospects of drafting a future constitution. Despite his growing boldness, not all Chinese Republicans are convinced."

 GXC.lategame.405.b: "Another windbag just blowing smoke."

 ##RKMT High Zeal Closing Chain (430-459)
 GXC.lategame.430.t: "The Third National Congress"
 GXC.lategame.430.d: "At last, China has been unified under one banner: the banner of the Kuomintang. It has been a long road. Sacrifices were made, families were divided, brave martyrs were lost. But in the end, despite everything the world could array against the revolution, Dr. Sun's teachings won out. Inspired by the eternal wisdom of the Three Principles, the Kuomintang rallied and inspired the people to overcome all those challenges just like its late revolutionary prophet said they would.\n\nFinally then, Chairman Hu Hanmin, on behalf of the Chinese people, has issued a call for delegates from all across the nation to come to [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] for deliberations as China can finally turn to the next page of its story: the nation-wide political tutelage. While many feared that like the provincial and local tutelages the process would be marred by the interference of military men, the victory of civilian factions in the party has shone a light at the end of the tunnel. For the first time in decades, the Chinese people can actually hope for a democratic future.\n\nThat is not to say there is not plenty of (well-earned) cynicism surrounding the Congress. Indeed, as Hu Hanmin steps up to the podium to address the amassed delegates at the start of proceedings, he has reiterated his words of caution against self-congratulatory indolence, instead extolling the need for continued revolutionary vigour. In Six Years, he boasts, the Kuomintang will complete the political tutelage and lay the ground work for the final phase of the revolution: a Constitutional Republic.\n\nOf course, despite Hu Hanmin's insistence that six years is a literal time-frame, even showing off his outline for how to achieve democracy within that window, many suspect that such a schedule is overly ambitious. Few think that a full democracy by the end of the decade is plausible, but times are clearly changing and many are growing bolder in their aspirations for the future of China."
 GXC.lategame.430.a: "With Hu at the helm, democracy is not far away."
 GXC.lategame.430.b: "Its clear that we have a long way to go."

 GXC.lategame.431.t: "The Constitutional Crusade"
 GXC.lategame.431.d: "Ever since the Li Zongren crisis, few have been willing to mention Li or Bai in public, with many hoping to forget it ever occurred. But the incident remains fresh in Sun Fo's mind, the young idealist forever shaken by the threat of military men to his father's revolution. Despite the prevailing orthodoxy his father set by insisting that no constitution be drawn until the constitutional phase, Sun has begun to come around to the notion that a provisional constitution must be drafted to act as a safeguard against further instability or tyranny. Growing almost obsessed with the issue, spending much of his spare time personally trying to draft one.\n\nTo Hu Hanmin however, there cannot be deviation from the party-line set by Sun Yat-sen. The reason why a constitution must wait until the constitutional phase (and also why the 1912 constitution was thrown out) is so all parties and groups across China can contribute to its drafting together on equal footing. To draft a provisional constitution now, while the Kuomintang has been invested with temporary but nevertheless full and absolute power needed to complete the tutelage, would be illogical. Moreover it would unfairly usurp the power of the future democratically elected National Assembly, and be an open admission that the party does not believe can finish the tutelage in a timely manner.\n\nIt would seem that while many have lost faith in the ability for democracy to be achieved within this generation, Hu Hanmin has not. More cynical minds however point out that when it comes to politics, Hu and the Elders control the party while other factions have sway over the bureaucracy. A provisional constitution that establishes the promised five branches early would shift power away from the Chairman and the party-state towards the newly founded bureaucratic government. This issue has exposed deep ideological dividing lines between the civilian party, and with no compromise in sight it seems only one world-view will prevail."
 GXC.lategame.431.a: "It is far too early to begin drafting a constitution."
 GXC.lategame.431.b: "On the contrary, we have gone too long without one."

 GXC.lategame.432.t: "Reconstructing a Nation"
 GXC.lategame.432.d: "Part and parcel to the Kuomintang National Reconstruction plan is the economic reconstruction, which is simultaneously extremely detailed yet also very open to interpretation, much like the other parts of Sun Yat-sen's doctrine. While a greater emphasis on economic affairs and relief for the common people was and remains the prevailing attitude among the civilian right, a growing sense of weariness has emerged among more conservative elements of the party.\n\nThe Western Hills faction has always been wary of the socialistic, iconoclastic nature of the post-reorganisation party, denouncing the left for their stoking of class warfare and anarchy. The staggering cost of Hu Hanmin's proposed national reconstruction agenda has also drawn many concerned eyes, combined with many Nationalists' aggressive anti-capitalist and xenophobic rhetoric many investors (especially foreign ones) are reluctant to give the Republic much needed capital to expand the economy. The alternative so far has been autarky and heavy taxation, which has attracted considerable resentment.\n\nFinally breaking their silence, Ju Zheng, Zou Lu, and Fu Rulin have drafted a resolution calling for the paring back of the scale and scope of the National Reconstruction Commission, hoping to concentrate Kuomintang financial energies towards only large-scale projects domestic investors cannot fund on their own. They have also advised the relaxation of taxation and economic controls, promoting a more market conciliatory approach to the Kuomintang \"National Capitalism\" programme.\n\nThis moderate, supposedly \"practical\" approach has been chastised by Hu Hanmin, who insists that political and national liberation must come hand in hand with economic and social liberation. Accusations have resurfaced from 1911 where men like Song Jiaoren were charged with reducing the Three Principles down to Two (omitting welfare), and Hu Hanmin has sternly berated any notion that the party must hold back from their pursuit of the eventual abolition of capitalism."
 GXC.lategame.432.a: "Wise men know when and where to open their purse."
 GXC.lategame.432.b: "A full-throttle approach is the only way to see true democracy."

 GXC.lategame.433.t: "The Other Republicans"
 GXC.lategame.433.d: "Despite growing dissent over the plausibility of a six year tutelage, Hu Hanmin finds himself well within his wheelhouse. In addition to being an experienced politician, gifted ideologue, and silver-tongued speaker, Hu is an exceptional legislator. With well-practised skill, he has begun to coax leading members of the congress towards his drafted six years plan of legislation, a half-decade long series of bills and ordinances that when implemented would lead the way in reshaping the nation towards a democracy.\n\nPromising key appointments to drafting committees to leading delegates, Hu has stressed the need for a stable tutelage in which the party-state fully mobilises its energies to accomplish its founding mission. The temporary nature of the tutelage, rather than being a source of instability is in fact a rallying point. Its short nature means that in proper democratic centralist fashion once the plan is drafted, deliberated, and decided all citizens will put their petty reservations and differences aside in favour of one shared, immediate goal, thus putting their full energies into seeing the plan through.\n\nHaving finally found a workable coalition of democratic Kuomintang figures, Hu insists that further compromise is not needed for the remainder of tutelage. Other parties and factions could wait until the soon-promised Constitutional phase where free elections in every single one of the thousands of counties in China can decide each group's proper influence. His prospective coalition partners are not so sure. Ju Zheng and the Western Hills faction have pleaded that the Kuomintang include other parties, pointing out that while the Beiyang Republic was incurably corrupted, it did have a budding centre-right democratic movement that should be separated and incorporated for the sake of stability and pluralism. Sun Fo similarly has called for the inclusion of trustworthy, idealistic parties - the fellow centre-left republican groups based in the south. Left unsaid is these inclusions would advance their own shared interests."
 GXC.lategame.433.a: "As one committee we can finally see tutelage through."

 GXC.lategame.434.t: "The Democratic Awakening"
 GXC.lategame.434.d: "The Kuomintang's party constitution states that the National Congress must elect its Chairman, though in practice the party's next chiefs rarely been in much doubt except in times of severe distress that is often accompanied by violence. But for the first time in perhaps its entire history, the party seems slated for a competitive (albeit insular) race. In addition to Hu Hanmin, the incumbent, both Ju Zheng of the Western Hills faction and Sun Fo of the Reconstruction Faction have announced their candidacies, seeking to steer the party through the remainder of the political tutelage.\n\nHu showed little signs of unease as he announced the candidates, still feeling assured of his inevitable victory in elections. After all, it was he that kept the party through its ignominious exile, kept the ravenous warlords at bay, fought off foreign threats and led the party from Guangzhou to national unification. To him, this election is the crowning moment of his career, a confirmation from representatives from across the entire nation that the people trust him to lead them across the final bridge to constitutionalism.\n\nDespite his confidence, his opponents are hardly unknown upstarts either. Ju Zheng is a faithful party stalwart, a revolutionary leader in Shandong during the 1911 Revolution and selected by Dr. Sun to be his interior minister in 1921. An effective jurist and founding member of the Western Hills Conference, his moderate conservative agenda has attracted considerable following from much of the party old-guard, northern delegates, and the bureaucracy.\n\nSun Fo likewise has become a household name as a gifted law-maker with an almost encyclopedic expertise of his father's work. His progressive agenda has sought a middle position between Hu and Ju. His support base among the party young guard, southerners, and intellectuals cannot easily be discounted. After each candidate finished using their allotted time to make their case for leadership, voting commenced."

 GXC.lategame.435.t: "Democracy in the Kuomintang?"
 GXC.lategame.435.d: "The Kuomintang is supposed to operate under the principles of \"democratic centralism\", where party members can freely discuss policy, but all are obliged to fully commit to the final decision with no hesitation or further discourse. In practice the \"democracy\" part has been few and far between,s o with the nation unified and a Third National Congress finally called, it was a surprise for our delegates to hear that the sitting Chairman, Hu Hanmin, is facing a competitive election.\n\nHu has led the nation, or at least he claims to have, through considerable upheaval - rallying the party in exile after the failed Northern Expedition and orchestrating its return to Guangzhou and then to unification. Despite the ever-present cynicism that blankets the nation, many believe him. Known for his deep commitment to the Three Principles, his unabashedly revolutionary ideals, and powerful rhetorical skills, he is the natural favourite to lead the nation through the political tutelage stage.\n\nTwo men have decided to brave this opportunity, backed by well established national blocs. Ju Zheng is a leader of the moderate and conservative wing of the party, harkening back to the legacy of Song Jiaoren. The devout Buddhist and powerful jurist has rallied many of the party's old guard, northern delegates, and the bureaucracy to his side as he vows to reverse the reorganisation and cut back on revolutionary excesses.\n\nSun Fo is the only son of party founder Sun Yat-sen, who has cultivated a reputation as the party's chief liberal ideologue. With the support of the party's young guard, southerners, and intellectuals he has promised a more moderate tutelage, combining progressive economic and social reforms with Western-influenced liberal values. While many in our delegation will ultimately vote their hearts with their secret ballots, most [ROOT.Getadjective] electors will likely vote as a bloc and [ROOT.GetLeader]'s endorsement is expected to make a considerable difference in the outcome."

Delegates, though officially elected by the local party chapters on a county level, can very tremendously in their autonomy and affiliation.\n\n[FROM.GetAdjective] delegates tend to vote as a bloc, owing to their region's comparative independence from the central government.

Quoting Chinese Classics and Sun Yat-sen's teachings with practised poise, his speech reassures the audience of a steady march to the repudiation of the interceding influence of socialism and the foundation of a new Chinese democracy led by gentlemen rather than uncouth warlords or radical rabblerousers.

In turn, the central committee frequently has been dominated by powerful personalities, the strongest frequently seizing the role of Chairman. There have been plenty of centralism in party directives, but very little democracy in the decades since the Kuomintang was formed.\n\nYesterday was supposed to be the day that changed. In a solemn affair, three leading members of the Kuomintang presented their vision for a new China, and after a quiet vote [GXC.GetLeader] won by a slim plurality.

But then, the fantasy fades and he reflects more soberly. China has already suffered decades of war and destruction, families destroyed and lives ruined. Now that it is finally on the cusp of peace and unification, would history forgive him if he made one final challenge to stop the nationalist dictatorship? Would it forgive him if he didn't?

Feng became a Kuomintang member, then he left, then he rejoined when the Nationalists returned. Maybe that's why his efforts at becoming a serious candidate for the Chairmanship were ignored - he was not even on the ballots. \"A democracy for insiders\", that's what Feng wants to say the nation. But would they listen? If they knew, would they follow him to fight for a real democracy? Or would they quietly hide in their homes, satisified with the peace unification has brought?

 GXC.lategame.460.d: "The party has always been a contentious one, filled with petty rivalries and grand ideological divides. But the new atmosphere that has emerged since the Second Congress has been a deeply unpleasant one, to say the least. Hu Hanmin has retreated to Guangzhou in vengeful disgrace, refusing any party or government job and resolving to make a living through writing. While ostensibly \"retired\" from politics, he still greets political visitors. Hu, Sun, and Chen Jitang are barely on speaking terms with the new government, the latter embittered by the new administration's decision to sideline the self-proclaimed \"heart of the revolution\".\n\nThe Western Hills Faction, while nominally securing the Chairmanship and retaining the support of much of the civilian bureaucracy and party infrastructure, has grown bitterly divided. The descendants of Song Jiaoren and Huang Xing's moderate wing of the party who nonetheless accepted Sun's authoritarian, revolutionary reorganisation. The fall of the avowed right reorganisationist Elders Clique has nevertheless brought little relief. Some have second thoughts, feeling that they have betrayed their leader, but their leaders maintain that Hu failed to deliver his part of the arrangement in protecting them from warlord encroachment and that the Western Hills faction did what they had to do. Their leading figures, Lin Sen, Ju Zheng, and Zou Lu resolve to steer a better ship.\n\nWhile the old Moscow Committee falters, Guangxi remains in exuberant spirits. With the military increasingly under their full sway, pushing out rival appointees, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi and their allies have grown arrogant but also energetic. In addition to sweeping reforms to the military, they have also begun to ramp up their public promotion of the so-called \"Guangxi System\", working to build a nation-wide political machine. Rebranding themselves as the \"Kuomintang Revival Association\", it is evident that Li has further ambitions for the future."

 GXC.lategame.461.t: "The Yue-Gui Split"
 GXC.lategame.461.d: "Ever since the opposition exploited divisions within the Cantonese camp to secure Hu Hanmin's ouster, Guangxi and Guangdong have been at odds. Tensions have continued to rise and Guangzhou has become a hotbed of rebellion, chafing under Li Zongren's efforts to centralise power around his military headquarters.\n\nMatter escalated in recent days when Liang Hancao and Lin Yungai, two members of the Central Supervisory Committee, brought forth multiple charges against Li Zongren, accusing him of illegally orchestrating Hu Hanmin's ouster through threats and assuming dictatorial powers. Chen Jitang has used the situation to expel New Guangxi aligned officials and officers from Guangdong and called for Chairman Lin Sen to follow through and arrest Li.\n\nThe various cliques that have gathered in Guangzhou have vowed to establish a committee system to divide power, to limited success. Gu Yingfen has become the political face of a growing Cantonese opposition. Gu however has quickly become resented for his politically charged appointments and refusal to receive outside counsel, leading to the emergence of the \"Beating the Drum Movement\" (drum is a homonym for Gu) within the splinter government, denouncing Gu's tyranny. Unexpectedly, many leftist ex-RCA members have cropped up in support of the Guangzhou committee, though Wang is thoroughly distrusted for his opportunism.\n\nSun Fo, already disgruntled, declared \"Li is no ordinary rat, but a plague-bearing one that must be exterminated\", triggering a war scare and market crash. His opponents in turn have accused him of price manipulation. Conspicuously absent from the proceedings is Hu Hanmin himself, who has abstained under the (likely correct) belief that his direct participation would trigger a civil war while the nation is still divided. He has instead called for party unity for the duration of the tutelage, though many note he has made no commitments afterwards."

 GXC.lategame.462.t: "Madame Li Zongren"
 GXC.lategame.462.d: "Despite the relatively conservative nature of the new government, avenues remain open for some women to exert significant power. Guo Dejie is a strong and forceful woman, keenly interested in her husband Li Zongren's work. Unlike Bai Chongxi's wife, who is comparatively shy and out of the spotlight, Guo Dejie was a formal member of the Guangxi provincial government and actively served in a variety of roles including Director of the Women's Propaganda Team for the Seventh Army, Executive Director of the Guangxi Women's Association and overseeing multiple wartime charities for orphans.\n\nAn indispensable part of General Li's public image, and with Chairman Lin Sen being a widower, she has happily played the role of Nationalist China's de facto First Lady. She is not, however, Li's only spouse. Like most powerful Chinese men, Li took on a concubine in 1924. Initially on good terms, Li's wife and concubine soon found themselves at odds. In an reversal of expected roles, the wife bore Li's only child (a son) while the concubine emerged increasingly powerful as her husband's chief emissary. Guo was the concubine.\n\nThe acrimony within the Li's household has become a source of rumour-mongering in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], tarnishing Guo's reputation within elite circles even as she enjoys a strong public image. Deeply jealous of her rival, Li Xiuwen, and her status as Li's formal wife, it is said she has moved to have Xiuwen's son Li Youlin call her mother, which was harshly rebuked by the young man.\n\nThis petty quarrel has spilled over into the public realm, during a birthday celebration for Bai Chongxi's elderly mother. Li Xiuwen, Li Zongren, and Guo Dejie sent three separate customary family banners to the Bai clan, and when Guo saw that Xiuwen's banner was the one hung on behalf of the Li's, Guo made such a furious scene (accusing the Bai's of looking down on her) that all three were hung separately as a compromise. Chairman Lin Sen, a long-time proponent of monogamy and the Kuomintang's decision to nominally abolish the practice of concubinage, has taken the time to chide the Li's, pointing to the infamous stories of Imperial harem politics and the discord polygamy has sowed in Chinese politics."

 GXC.lategame.463.t: "Counter-Revolutionaries and Censorship"
 GXC.lategame.463.d: "Censorship is prevalent in Nationalist China, with the press largely forced to conform to government imposed standards. The extent to which this repression varies, with some newspapers being directly Kuomintang affiliated while others balancing their journalistic integrity and toeing the state line. Continued intra-party instability has not proven kind to media independence, even as the Kuomintang struggles to create a consistent message for themselves.\n\nEven as the various party factions see-saw for power, the \"Regulation for Punishing Countr-Revolutionaries\" has been successfully passed with ambivalent support, further strengthening the state's ability to curtail unwanted viewpoints. Various leftist, liberal, and even pro-Hu Hanmin newspapers have been shut down, particularly in recently conquered provinces that are under more strict military or party rule. Many editors complain that expectations have been erratic, with censors playing a daily guessing game about their superiors' expectations. Fearing reprisal, many err on the side of caution, further stifling publishers. In one embarassing case, censors banned the distribution of the government's own official press statement.\n\nOne foreign correspondent notes that Chinese censorship is an order of magnitude worse than even the neighbouring Japanese, calculating that the Japanese cut out fewer than 500 words from one prominent American news agency across several years, while the Chinese removed four times as many from the same publication in just a few months. The long arm of Chinese censorship is only expected to grow as the new government finds clever ways to curtail foreign press like the British-owned North China Daily News. Located within a concession, the paper could safely print but the party-state has revoked its postal privileges to impair distribution.\n\nWith the revolution ongoing, there are few voices within the party willing to stand up against these restrictions. Most have found some refuge in Guangzhou where restrictions are somewhat looser, but real change is not expected any time soon."

 GXC.lategame.464.d: "The New Guangxi Clique has made it their mission to reforge China into a nation capable of repelling invaders, pushing forward plans to convert the 12 hours per week dedicated to highschool sports into time allocated for paramilitary training. Ma Junwu, a leading Guangxi educator and fittingly the translator of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, has gathered leading intellectuals and legislators to call for turning playing fields into \"Save-the-Nation\" fields. They have dismissed arguments that such drastic measures would diminish the reputation of Chinese education, contending that it is not being incapable of playing ball that the students should be afraid of being mocked for, but rather being incapable of defending their own country.\n\nBai Chongxi has gone further, saying that sports in China should be evaluated on the basis of \"economy, practicality, applicability, and universality of access\" and military training exercises meet all four criteria. To him, military and adjacent events like running, swimming, mountain climbing, high and distance jumping, callisthenics, and target practice were cheap and immediately needed, while popular sports like tennis were only open for the rich.\n\nBai has mocked the hypocritical students who eagerly participated in boycotts and protests against Japanese imperialism, but were nowhere to be found when called to serve their nation. Li has struck a similar tone, arguing that students are the future leaders of the country and have great sway over the masses, and if they are unwilling to defend their nation then China is doomed. Despite their differences, Ju Zheng agreed, holding that China ought to adopt Japanese style fitness and medical exams, disqualifying effete officials from the government, education, and even marriage. Their harsh words have won them little support among the Chinese student body, many of whom have joined with educators to protest the rollout of this new policy. After a narrow vote..."

 GXC.lategame.465.d: "While the Kuomintang promote social revolution, it has also gone to great lengths to preserve or reinforce elements of Chinese culture that they have deemed valuable. Chinese Calligraphy is an ancient art form, considered one of the four classical skills of Chinese scholar-gentlemen (alongside playing stringed instruments, painting and proficiency in \"Go\"), and indeed many of the Kuomintangs leading members are quite fond of refining their technique during their free time.\n\nCalligraphy has undergone various transformations over the years and different styles have emerged. The Nationalist government boasts of \"Four Great Calligraphers of the Republic\" among their ranks, with Tan Yankai of Hunan specialising in regular script, the illustrious Hu Hanmin in official script, the elderly anarchist Wu Zhihui in seal script, and the respected Yu Youren in cursive script. While this label certainly has propaganda connotations, trying to demonstrate the new government's respect for venerable traditions, Yu Youren in particular has been credited for advancing cursive script.\n\nHe is said to have been the first to develop a modern standard cursive script, regarded by many as a sage in this form. Faster and easier to write and read, while still retaining accuracy and beauty, Yu has invested considerable energy researching, organising, and cataloguing thousands of Chinese characters into his widely read \"Standard Cursive Script Thousand Characters\". He has also founded a \"Standard Cursive Script Society\" to promote this new form.\n\nHis calligraphy is said to be so precious, various notices he handwrote, including those warning against public urination are said to have been stolen and sold as collectors' items. This promotion of Chinese traditional values has proven to be a boon for conservative elements of the Kuomintang, striking a chord with the old Chinese scholar-gentry and giving some traction for the besieged Western Hills government who often bemoan the loss of Chinese culture to uncultured warlords and iconoclastic socialists."

 GXC.lategame.466.t: "The Old Pillar of the Central Committee"
 GXC.lategame.466.d: "In and amongst the contentious ranks of the rival Central Executive Committees, there remain very few individuals still within the \"neutral\" space, at least in both character and official stance. Naturally there is a considerable cohort of individuals championing merely the \"party\", with neither \"Left\" or \"Right\" maintaining any sort of standing within the Kuomintang. Championing party unity to the utmost, declaring all those that align with such factional sentiments as akin to enemies of Dr. Sun and the Three Principles. This sentiment is undoubtedly popular, sported by the likes of Western Hills (even if their extremist adherents consider Wang Jingwei's cadres to no longer deserve party membership), Sun Fo and Reconstruction (If yet again they clamour for a re-registration of the party membership to eliminate \"bad\" elements), and even that of Hu Hanmin, with his consistent exhorting of party discipline and organisation decrying the fractured nature the United Front policy posits.\n\nAlas, history has not been kind to the unity of the original membership of the Kuomintang. Close comrades of 1924 torn apart by revolutionary fervour, power grabs, and self-serving sacrifices upon the altar of the National Revolution. However certain individuals have managed to remain steadfast, unaltered in their loyalty and dedication towards the Party and its Unity. A sitting Central Executive Committee member since its inception in 1924, Ding Weifen, a courteous man and once a fierce revolutionary, has forever remained a pillar of duty. A reminder of what the Party fights for.\n\nJoining the Tongmenghui close after its inception, Ding would inherit the title as chairman of the Shandong branch. Rallying Shandong at the beckon of Xinhai, Ding would become director of the Shandong Kuomintang Provincial Party Committee in 1912. Participating in the National Protection War, Ding would serve in Sun's Constitutional Protection Government, utilising his ties as a rare Northern Party member to influence membership within the Central Plains. Participating in the reorganisation, Ding would host Sun Yat-sen, Wang Jingwei and others during the Guofu's fatal trip to Beijing. Sympathising with Western Hills, Ding nonetheless stayed steadfast with the Canton Committee, participating in the Second National Congress.\n\nForced to flee the country as the Five Races trumped the White Sun, Ding would be contacted by Hu Hanmin's rival CEC, and elected as one of its members. Ding has dedicated his time in the interim towards prolific writing, publishing \"Qidongyu\" in 1931, \"Mao Shi Shaungsheng Tongzhuanyun Zheng\" in 1936, becoming an influential expert in studying Confucian Classics, even receiving praise from Zhang Taiyan. In official party business however, Ding remains extensively relied upon within Northern Party matters, acting as its impromptu head of affairs."

While it is clear to most of the world that the new government will be ruled by the Nationalist Party, the chasm between the New Guangxi Clique dominated government (Gui) and the Cantonese dominated opposition based in Guangdong (Yue) has grown wider now that there are few external threats to unite them.\n\nSun Fo has taken the lead as a spokeman for the Yue camp, ending an unofficial ceasefire in the war of words by formally denouncing Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Huang Shaohong, and Huang Xuchu as a tyrannical army cabal. With the backing of generals including Xu Chongzhi, Li Liejun, and Chen Jitang, the Yue government has rallied a broad front to oppose the looming dictatorship and issued an ultimatum for Li Zongren to resign all his positions within the next 48 hours. More than that, they have broadened their demands, insisting on a just policy for punishing and rewarding soldiers (who are often seen as above the law), the elimination of regionalism in the army, complete public transparency of the budget, and the rooting out of corruption in the bureaucracy, implicitly placing blame on major government shortcomings on the New Guangxi clique.\n\nWhile Li Zongren has refused to publicaly dignify a response, his allies have returned fire by accusing Sun Fo of being an American-made dilettante, writing in a formal letter that he is \"a man rich with emotion, but with no wisdom, with a wealth of courtesy but lacking righteousness, changeable in personality, without personal opinion or judgment.\", pointing to his carousel of loyalties including joining and then abandoning the Western Hills Conference, the Wang Government, and most recently the rightist Government. In turn they claim he has stolen millions in his various capacities, enriching himself and his allies.\n\nEfforts are underway by the Western Hills leadership, with legs in both camps, to create a political offramp and reunite the Yue and Gui governments.

Foreigners have quickly caught on, with some major publications openly contextualising the former as \"Puppet President Lin\" and regarding Li as the true leader of the fledging government. Li's allies have surely been acting like their victory is soon at hand, with Bai Chongxi and other generals giving self-congratulatory addresses to the troops while Huang Shaohong and Huang Xuchu address visitors from around the country touting the successes of Guangxi as a \"Model Province\" for the nation. Madame Li's recent speaking tour and a media blitz by Guangxi Press barons like Qian Shifu and Kang Zhenhua have all signaled the same message: the time for President Li Zongren has come.\n\nThe would-be President himself has taken a more modest tone, denying any direct ambitions for leadership. He has made a concerted effort to court liberal democratic figures through the Kuomintang Revival Association, distancing himself from the regionalist New Guangxi Clique identity in favor of projecting the image of a national war hero. He has cast a stark contrast with the intellectuals that dominate the top parts of the rival Yue Government, depicting himself as a humble soldier from a poor background that rose through the ranks in a time of great emergency. His plain speaking style and pragmatic worldview has attracted some sympathy in contrast to the flowery language and seemly impractical visions of his enemies.\n\nLi has sought to meet with various northern figures in Beijing in his role as the \"Personal Military Representative of the President in Beijing\", achieving popularity among military and liberal circles, his competence as an administrator credited for calming student protests. His friendship with Bai Chongxi, a Hui Chinese, has allowed him to secure Chinese Muslim support and he has also sought to garner the endorsement of noted figures like Hu Shih, Gan Houxian, and Yan Yangchu (\"James Yen\").

Their ability to control the generals or enforce the negotiated terms after the Second Congress have largely faded, as Li Liejun's efforts can only travel so far. The Guangzhou rebels formally acknowledge Lin's Presidency but largely ignore him, unwilling to cooperate with a government with Li in office. They have pleaded for Lin to order Li's removal, a political impossibility during the war.\n\nDespite this, the Western Hills faction remains determined to resist the General's influence.

 GXC.lategame.503.t: "Throwing the Gauntlet"
 GXC.lategame.503.d: "News of Lin Sen's imminent resignation as President has reverbated across the nation, quickly escaping the nominally private Central Executive Committee meeting. By dawn it has reached the front pages of every major newspaper in cities all across China. His decision to nominate Ju Zheng as his successor has caught the Gui camp off-guard, but Li Zongren remains undaunted, accepting a nomination of his own from major allies like Bai Chongxi and Huang Shaohong. A few minor candidates have thrown their hats in the ring, but the field is expected to winnow out very quickly before the formal party vote.\n\nEyes turn to a humble home in Guangzhou, the unofficial base of the Yue faction. There lives the only real third contender for power within the Kuomintang apparatus: the disgraced Chairman Hu Hanmin. Seething in his original betrayal and ouster, he has refused any part in the new government but has refused to endorse any move to topple it either, despite frequent coaxing by former allies like Gu Yingfen, Sun Fo, and Chen Jitang. He maintained that Dr. Sun would want all his followers to faithfully adhere to the party's leadership to ensure national unification.\n\nWith that having been achieved, many expected him to emerge from his self-imposed exile. Today, he has finally done so to great fanfare among the Yue camp, formally taking on the mantle of Chairman of the Guangzhou Committee. In a booming address, he has denounced Li Zongren as a military usurper in the vein of Yuan Shikai. He has called upon Guangdong to take charge as the Piedmont of China, making a stand against Li Zongren and his clique. With regards to the coming election, he has not declared his candidacy, instead declaring that any election would be illegitimate so long as Li Zongren remains free to corrupt it.\n\nApplauded by many, accused of sour grapes by others, Hu's return to the public scene represents a grave threat to Li Zongren's ambitions and has undercut the Western Hill's efforts to rally the civilian opposition. Despite his bravado however, Hu's own position in Guangzhou is said to be insecure as well - his exile has cultivated an air of mystique but his once towering stature has nevertheless declined."

 GXC.lategame.504.d: "Many hoped the new Republic of China's first election for President would be a democratic one, with representatives from each of the thousands of district in China in attendance in a grand affair. Many also hoped it would be a dignified affair, combining the majesty of the office with the jubiliation of a new leader. Neither seems to be particularly likely in [GetYear], and while some vote is expected to be cobbled together down the line, the Kuomintang's hastily assembled internal party conference will de facto decide the nation's leader for the duration of the political tutelage.\n\nThe proceedings were in shambles before it even began. Yue aligned delegates have elected to boycott the conference, following Hu Hanmin's example as they insist on Li's arrest. Blatant threats, bribes, and blackmail have escalated, marring the legislative floor with open violence. Lin Sen, in his last acts as Chairman has pushed the meeting along, acknowledging that there really is only one question on the table. His choice proved fortuitous, keeping matters from being completely derailed.\n\nThe candidates make their cases in formal speeches though all present already know the boiler plates. Democratisation and reconciliation with Yue for Ju Zheng. Order and stable leadership for Li Zongren. Under the shadow of a renewed war, observers silently pray for their favoured side to win. Wasting little time, the ballots are counted. By a thin margin..."

 GXC.lategame.505.t: "The Yue-Gui Face-off"
 GXC.lategame.505.d: "Despite decades of setbacks since Xinhai, the final victors of the warlord era are the twin provinces that make up Liangguang (literally \"two Guangs\"): Guangdong (abbreviated Yue) and Guangxi (abbreviated Gui). The Kuomintang factions that first gathered their strength in Liangguang have achieved something rather rare in Chinese history - a south to north path to unification. With it, the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party) has established themselves as the undisputed ruling party of China.\n\nOr well, it would be if it were not for the continuing divisions in fractious one-party state. On-going disputes over national leadership has manifested itself in the de facto split between the \"Gui\" faction, nominally ruled by Chairman Lin Sen and the civilian Western Hills Faction but de facto under the growing sway of Li Zongren and the New Guangxi Clique, and the rival \"Yue\" faction\" which has amassed a broad coalition to oppose Li Zongren in wake of his victory over former Chairman Hu Hanmin during the Second National Congress.\n\nMatters have escalated in recent days with Lin Sen's decision to step down as Chairman, no doubt under pressure to make way for Li Zongren's ascent into the highest office of the land. Li has been eagerly burnishing his credentials both as a military hero and as a friend of Chinese liberalism, painting himself as a reasonable, practical man capable of solving China's problems. In a desperate attempt to avoid what otherwise would be seen as fait accompli, Lin has endorsed his ally Ju Zheng as his successor, forcing an internal party election and hoping entrenched civilian party interests close ranks behind Ju. This has thrown the Gui government into disarray.\n\nThe weaker Yue government has responded by coalescing around Hu Hanmin, who has returned from his self-imposed exile in Guangzhou to take leadership. Calling for the total ouster of Li Zongren and his clique, they have leveraged Guangdong's traditional role as the bastion of the party to mount a convincing rival government. Yue and Gui seem on the verge of civil war, with the coming Gui election likely determining whether or not the crisis can be resolved in a peaceful manner. Naturally, [ROOT.GetLeader] has been courted by all sides."

The message could not be any more clear: \"this is an internal matter, outsiders need not speak\".\n\nWhat an selfish, oafish attitude for a party to hold! They claim to be unifiers, to fight for democracy, and yet the people cannot speak their mind? This humiliation has not gone over well in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], and many within the [ROOT.GetRulingParty] call for action.

Dismissing any pleasantries with the now toothless Ju Zheng and the Western Hills clique, he almost immediately brought the weight of New Guangxi to bear against his remaining rivals, gathered neatly in the Yue government to be eliminated together. As New Guangxi aligned propagandists hammered Hu Hanmin, Sun Fo, Chen Jitang, Gu Yingfen, and others who dared to stand up against China's conquering hero. Bai Chongxi and the general staff began drafting up battle plans but it ultimately was for nothing.\n\nBefore marching orders could be disseminated, the Yue government dissolved almost overnight. Thanks to a mixture of careful bribes and general demoralisation, most of the elite Guangdong Air Force (perhaps the best paid and most prized arm of the New Guangdong clique) defected to the central government and they were soon joined by an exodus of army defectors. Long wracked by infighting, the warring factions of the Yue government were too divided to even formally dissolve their administration, individually leaving for exile without resigning their posts. Only Hu Hanmin bothered stay in Guangzhou, his second chance at power in shambles.\n\nThe central army mops up any remaining resistance and the secret police arrests any one who dares continue to speak out, but all know that Li has already won - even if they are shocked he did so largely without firing a shot.

Ju Zheng refused to acknowledge his defeat, and the accompanying public protests were much larger than expected, say nothing about the amassing forces under Hu Hanmin's banner. A war between Yue and Gui seemed inevitable, until it was not.\n\nLi Zongren was the first to be arrested. Striding towards his headquarters in his new Presidential outfit, he entered his war room and was consequently ambushed by a special action team. The grim faces of his staff and the presence of Yue-aligned Marshal Li Liejun indicated he would not be President for long. Liejun read out the charges filed against him, but Li refused to go down without a fight. An experienced soldier and a student of martial arts, it took several men to restrain General Li. He roared with rage at the betrayal as his lieutenants stared emotionlessly, but Marshal Liejun did not flinch when Li lunged at him unsuccessfully - one last act of defiance. Something had to be done to avoid another round of war.\n\nBai Chongxi was arrested in his field headquarters while preparing to march against the Yue army, and Huang Xuchu seized in Nanning by Governor Huang Shaohong, who saw the writing on the wall. As Hu Hanmin arrived into the Presidential Palace, escorted by his leading supporters, he refused to give his defeated rival the dignity of seeing him in detention. Instead, as Ju Zheng and other Western Hills grandees looked on sheepishly, he reclaimed his place as Chairman, with fire in his eyes as the Gui government crumbles to dust.

With the growing harmony of voices championing an end to military rule, there is much to be done, and many consequences to be had.\n\nWhatever it may be, the next few months will be the defining crescendo of the National Revolution, to define its future, and the future of the very nation. With the party-state working towards stabilisation and reconstruction, all eyes are on [Root.GetLeader], for the decisions made will reverberate for generations to come."

 GXC.lategame.531.d: "With the light of Kuomintang control now shining on all corners of the Chinese nation, a most pressing matter has been presented to [ROOT.GetLeader]. Whilst a revolution lead from Guangdong and Guangxi, the party now encompasses all regions of China, and it must acknowledge this fact. Like Prussia and Piedmont before them, the party-state must bring forth their brethren into the new age, and incorporate them so as to partake in the National Revolution. To take a first bold step in enacting this, members within the party have sought the expansion of the Central Executive Committee to include a more diverse array of members.\n\nWith Hu Hanmin's exile in Moscow, his Second Central Executive Committee majorly comprised those close to him, and those who joined following the failure of the Northern Expedition. As a result of such, it was stacked with Elders Clique and Western Hills members almost absolutely - with the notable inclusion of Sun Fo, Wu Chaoshu and Wang Kunlun in absentia. With the homecoming and return of the Chairman onto Chinese soil, the committee was expanded to include the military factions who allowed such a return.\n\nWith the capture of more and more urban centers, the populace and intellectuals alike clamber for another expansion of the CEC, to properly represent all members of Chinese society. Key members within Guangdong and Guangxi suggest expanding the seats of the New Guangdong and New Guangxi cliques, others bring forth the idea of including members from other provinces to balance Southern dominance, some murmurs even indicate the inclusion of Dangwai to encompass a wide front of democratic ideals and regionalist interests.\n\nSuch decisions have precedence within party history, as previous committees had made attempts to balance the membership list by region, whilst also welcoming a multitude of warlord allies to ensure their compliance in military matters. Ultimately, the verdict is up to [ROOT.GetLeader], and their vision for the future."

 GXC.lategame.532.d: "The nation may be united, but its people are not. Continuous resistance against the party's control by subversive elements pestering us have lead to the development and creation of the \"Public Security Bureau\", a new organisation aimed to squash all dissent against party rule, and ensure the stable progress of the revolution. However such an organisation cannot function without strong leadership, and the factions within the Kuomintang have pushed forward a number of select individuals of particular repute and skillset for such a role. Candidate put forth by Chen Jitang and his clique, Li Shizhen, is perhaps the most experienced of the prospective police chiefs, for he is quite renowned for having been sent abroad to learn the policing tactics of the USA, Japan and Europe, and is already an adept administrator. On New Guangxi's side, they have put forth their own personal head of their secret police, with obvious ties and devotion to the New Guangxi clique, he has been reliable in ensuring their control of the province. Finally, the Western Hills Clique have proposed that Central Supervisory Committee member, and known civilian leader, Mao Zuquan take the position. A lawyer by trade, he might prove to be a more fair and equal hand on the wheel."

 GXC.lategame.533.d: "Our governmental bureaucracy is in dire need for expansion, for some fear it has reached its limits. To ensure stable, efficient, well functioning government, the party has decided to expand and renew the current civil service system to accommodate for the new lands and civilians under their control. Of course with a new and expanded service comes the question of who to staff the many positions required? Many central figures are suggesting that appointments be made based on loyalty to the party and chairman, to make certain corruption and a self-serving attitude does not fester.\n\nIn contradiction, the Western Hills clique have suggested that we open the positions to the previous Beiyang burueacrats that held the position, for their experience might prove invaluable in such a time. Alongside this, the Liberals have championed that the fresh, Western educated young breed of returning overseas students are more than fit enough to fill such positions, with their fresh outlook and burgeoning vigor. Finally, the New Guangxi clique have pushed for veterans of the army - in dire need of retirement - to be given the positions, having proved their loyalty with blood."

 GXC.lategame.534.t: "A Free Legislature?"
 GXC.lategame.534.d: "In our efforts to maintain cohesion and a resolute following of Dr. Sun's ideals, the recent period of party-state has directly lead to the consequence that all decisions, large or small, in some way went through the expansive party apparatus, naturally creating a bureaucratic system that objects to change and transformation. With such a current system, a new legislature is a prospect with shaky foundations, despite this many internal factions are expecting a diversification of the ideas compromising the legislature. Pioneering the initiative is naturally Sun Fo and his Reconstruction Faction, demanding an in increase in non-Kuomintang member participation. The Western Hills clique are not far behind, harkening back to Song Jiaoren's legacy, they have also put their weight behind the inclusion of external parties as legislators. Even the Elders Clique, cautious and apprehensive as always, have been open to the discussion and idea.\n\nIn reality, these positions are not actually elected, and instead would be appointed by the Kuomintang party-state to ensure increased democratisation of the nation. In practical application, this leaves three options. Firstly, the prospective outside legislators could participate as Dangwai, a cautious but much needed step towards proper political participation. Secondly, they could follow the Western Hills ideas, and form their own political parties in parallel to the Kuomintang. Thirdly, the Chairman could put his foot down, and maintain Kuomintang stewardship of the nation for the time being, democracy after all, cannot be rushed."
 GXC.lategame.534.a: "They may partake, as Dangwai."

 GXC.lategame.535.t: "The Female Patriot"
 GXC.lategame.535.d: "Whilst the revolution pushes ahead onto a new age of prosperity, we cannot merely leave behind our female compatriots in such a time of social upheaval and change. With his noted writings and theories, Hu Hanmin continues to be concerned with women's fate in modern society, insisting that they should be granted economic independence in society. \n\nFollowing such thoughts, he himself seems rather optimistic on the future of women's role in society, noting that since the Industrial Revolution, equality in the work force has been approaching a balance, and women's social status has improved as their economic contribution has increased. To push forward such a process, he has proposed that China requires a reconstruction of its socio-economic organisation to create a well-coordinated, property-sharing, and domestic society. With humanity's instinct to love others as well as oneself, genuine pure-love in all human relationships would be bound to flourish.\n\nIn parallel to this, Sun Fo has naturally taken a similarly progressive outlook on his female compatriots. With the further participation of women in society and government, naturally their status will be elevated to be on par with their fellow man. However, Sun Fo in particular has rejected the notion of birth control being freely available for women, fearing that the Chinese nation would be short of manpower by the end of the 20th century if it were to be easily accessible.\n\nIn complete contraflow to the ideas of his contemporaries, face of the New Guangxi Clique, Li Zongren, has put forth a nigh puritan outlook on his fairer counterparts. Whilst considering them key participants in society as a whole, even pushing for the permanent mobilisation of women in the army, it would appear he desires a puritanical, militarised and literate sect of society ready to serve the nation. An advocate against what he deems immorality, he has called for controls on women's clothing to counter promiscuity."
 GXC.lategame.535.a: "Socio-economic reorganisation, for pure love!"

 GXC.lategame.535.c: "Li Zongren has the right ideas."

 GXC.lategame.536.t: "Capturing the National Revolution"
 GXC.lategame.536.d: "Imperative but often unappreciated is the integral art of capturing history as it happens. An art in itself, the Chinese nation is rife with dynamic photographers, witty journalists and endeavouring artists all of whom work collectively to encapsulate the terrifically tumultuous period of the Warlord Era. And the Party itself is no exception to this rule.\n\nPertinent member of Sun Fo's young guard Reconstruction Faction, illustrious diplomat, close friend of Wu Chaoshu, accomplished bureaucrat, and more vibrantly, a wonderful photographer. Fu Bingchang is one of the more youthful politicians within the Party's retinue, having only joined the party at a mere twenty two years old. Graduating with a degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Hong Kong, Fu would develop a keen interest in photography, founding the short-lived Jinshi society specialising in scenic photography.\n\nJoining Dr. Sun's 1918 Constitutional Protection Government through familial connections, Fu would find renewed purpose and service as Wu Tingfang's secretary, he would develop a close kinship with Wu Chaoshu, Wu Tingfang's son. Accompanying Wu Chaoshu on various diplomatic missions as his secretary, Fu would return to China to serve as the representative of the Finance and Foreign Affairs ministry to Hong Kong. Transferred to serve as the supervisor of Guangdong Customs in 1923, Fu would find himself cataloguing the various events of the power struggle as they happened, having recently acquired a new camera by 1924.\n\nIn a Pictorialist style, Fu manages to capture the highlights of the Kuomintang's power struggle and Northern Expedition. Ranging from portraits of Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Hanmin, to group photographs of Tan Yankai, Sun Fo, Gu Yingfen, Wang Jingwei, and numerous other party elders. Fu's collection of photographs have gained particular notoriety with the resurgence of the Party, as captivated onlookers from around the world look to the past of the often besmirched Kuomintang."

 GXC.lategame.560.t: "Dongli Mountain House"
 GXC.lategame.560.d: "Back during the reign of the Daoguang Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, Jiang Lixiang founded the Liyin Garden in one of Dongguan city's composite villages. Fate would not be kind to the garden, however. For one reason or another, the garden was abandoned during the Century of Humiliation and remained so until recently. General Jiang Guangnai, grandson of Jiang Lixiang and one of Chen Mingshu's close allies, took it upon himself to renovate the garden in the aftermath of Chen Mingshu's seizure of Guangzhou.\n\nHowever, instead of restoring the garden to its original state, Jiang has decided to build a villa in the garden. Renaming it to the Hongli Mountain House, this impressive new two-story building with a reinforced concrete structure covers an area of 223 square metres. Boasting a porch and front facade constructed of stone metres, the house takes many inspirations from Western-style villas. Indeed, its red brick exterior walls on three sides and Western Ionic capital-esque columns show much appreciation for Western architecture. With its construction finished now with Chen Mingshu's consolidation of power, Jiang Guangnai has made Hongli his primary residence and the envy of many."

In order to rouse public support and propagate his agenda, Chen Mingshu announced to the denizens of Guangzhou that he would be giving a speech at Sun Yat-sen's old residence.\n\nStarting his speech, Chen declared, 'China's greatest enemy has always been imperialism. It was the British Empire that brought the taint of opium to China's shores and started the Century of Humiliation, it was the Russian Empire which stripped China of Outer Manchuria and western Xinjiang and encouraged Mongol separatism, it was the Empire of Japan which seized Taiwan from China, and it was the German Empire which crushed the first Northern Expedition.\n\nNo longer will the Chinese people tolerate a government which kowtows to the imperial powers, the Chinese people must overthrow all imperialist collaborators and establish a revolutionary government composed of the producing people! Overthrow Imperialism! Overthrow [FNG.GetLeader]! Overthrow Japanese Imperialism, Restore the Lost Territories of Manchuria!'"

 GXC.lategame.562.t: "The Anarchists of Guangzhou"
 GXC.lategame.562.d: "Tan Pingshan's climb to power in Liangguang has made him a credible candidate for leadership of Chinese Syndicalism almost overnight. But much to his chagrin, the League of Chinese Syndicalists is somehow even less governable than the Kuomintang. With the Guangdong CSP, made up of various Marxist industrial socialists, now allied, Tan seeks to combine them with his Kuomintang loyalists to build a support base to contest the League. His next target is to recruit the anarchists in the LCS.\n\nMany anarchists such as Mo Jipeng remain independent of the LCS, trying to stay true to anarchist principles rather than bend to the hypocritical authoritarianism of both. In Guangzhou, the bulk of anarchist thinkers have converged around Liu Shifu's old circles. Liu, born Liu Shaobin, was a member of the Tongmenghui who later formed both the Conscience Society and the Cock-crow Society. They lived in a common household with failed plans for establishing an agrarian commune. Though there were other anarchists in the city, Liu's long running newspaper People's Voice and his powerful personality made him the centre of Guangzhou anarchism. He also became one of the first Chinese Syndicalists, organising masons, shoemakers, barbers, and restaurant employees into dozens of trade unions through his Resolution Club.\n\nLiu, dubbed the Proudhon of China and lauded by Wu Zhihui (who once claimed that if he was still around, Chinese anarchism could be achieved in merely 500 years rather than 3,000), died from overwork in 1915. His unions survived him under his brother Liu Shixin, but slowly lost ground to the organised industrial unions of the CSP in the 1920s.\n\nTan Pingshan's recent courtship of the reluctant Liu Shixin may be a test to see if he really is worthy to be the next face of Chinese syndicalism. His current supporters however warn that courting the infamously flighty anarchists may be a mistake, destabilising the vanguardist spirit of action in favour of ineffectual 'talk'."

 GXC.lategame.563.d: "Tan has always been close with the Third Internationale. Elected as the CSP's representative to the Third Internationale he became friends with M.N. Roy, an Indian delegate and later leading Mission Militaire Internationale en Chine (MMIC) representative. In 1926, Tan argued before the China Committee of the Internationale that China's national revolution was driven by workers, farmers, and the urban petite bourgeoisie but by nature a bourgeois revolution rather than belonging to the proletariat. He called for the Internationale to provide greater attention and guidance to the CSP, implicitly blaming the Kuomintang for the disastrous expedition.\n\nThe speech, made while fighting continued, was seen as impertinent by many and effectively sealed his sidelining by the Paris Kuomintang. The CSP similarly expelled him in 1932 after profound disagreements during the Shanghai Uprising. Still, for many in the MMIC, Tan is seen as a figure who could more practically bring the Kuomintang towards syndicalism, especially after the plentiful mishaps of the current LCS leadership. Since returning home Tan has been willing to switch tracks as needed.\n\nWith his opponents in Guangdong firmly vanquished and seeing an opportunity in the resentment many party outsiders (Dangwai) feel towards the Kuomintang party-state, Tan has begun extending olive branches to various progressive democrats and even liberal figures in hopes of landing their support. His poor treatment of Chen Mingshu and Liang Hancao has not been forgotten however, and many are reluctant to give Tan the benefit of the doubt. Still, [CHI.GetLeader]'s own popularity has fluctuated over the years."

 GXC.lategame.564.d: "Gu Dacun had previously joined the Chinese Syndicalist Party in 1924 although was already involved in revolutionary politics since the November 4th Movement in 1919. Gu was also a participant in the Eastern Expedition, which saw Yue Warlord Chen Jiongming expelled from the province. Gu led the Dongjiang Army to many great victories in the Northern Expedition and organised the peasant mass movement in Wuhua County. He led many farmers and peasants to establish farmers' associations, designed to combat landlord tyranny and reduce rent.\n\nWhen the Northern Expedition failed, Gu led his men into Baxiang Mountain, establishing a revolutionary base. Although Peng Pai and Gu Dacun were originally on friendly ties with the Chinese Syndicalist League, the Li Lisan Line which insisted that the Syndicalist Revolution focus on urbanised regions, a major affront to the rural socialist movement. Breaking with the Syndicalist League, Gu and Peng continually harassed the Guangdong warlords in the countryside for a decade before the Kuomintang returned.\n\nGu Dacun, as Peng Pai's chief lieutenant, has fittingly been appointed Mayor of Guangzhou with instructions to tame the ever restless city. The city, filled with malcontents even in the best of times, has seen tensions inflamed by Syndicalist rabble rousers and the mismanagement of Liang Hancao and Chen Yaozu. The one thing both sides can agree on is they are not thrilled to be ruled by a gang of raggedly peasants."

 GXC.lategame.565.d: "While reaction has been curbed in Guangxi, much unrest remains. Wei Baqun, one of the leaders of the Baise Uprising, has been at work trying to stabilise socialist rule there. There are tensions between those who were former NGX soldiers who defected later like Yu Zuobai and those like Wei who were always rural insurgents. General Yu insists that a more moderate programme and the integration of the old Guangxi army will win over the conservative province, stabilising leftist rule.\n\nWei however is under pressure from Peng Pai in Guangdong, who tends to advocate for a different, more eccentric way of growing close to the people. For one, he tends to insist that his followers dress like the peasants they intend to serve, pushing party cadres to leave behind the urban intellectual backgrounds that tend to dominate both the Kuomintang and Chinese Syndicalist party. For Peng, himself an educated son of the gentry, this was a necessary step to truly become a servant of the people. While sometimes criticised for his tendency to abandon socialist orthodoxy, few can deny it has served him well so far.\n\nHow practical these measures would be in Guangxi, with peasants deeply suspicious of sanctimonious outsiders, remains to be seen. Peng definitely has an advantage over his former rivals in Tan and Chen in this regard, but many local leaders insist a more pragmatic approach is needed."

Right wing KMT members and sympathetic nationalists all around China hope that Hu may indeed be capable of saving China from both the clutches of imperialism and the socialist autocracy of Wang Jingwei. Hu Hanmin has also begun to build up his own array of allies. Sun Fo, leader of the Reconstruction Clique is in Nanjing, but he and his fellow liberals are viewed with suspicion and distrust for not being socialists.\n\nIf Wang will not lend his ear to Sun, perhaps Hu can entice him to his side if Guangzhou and Nanjing find their differences irreconcilable. There is also Chen Mingshu and the Fourth Army situated here in Guangdong and loosely aligned with the leftists in Nanjing. Although they likely have ambitions of their own, Chen Jitang's consolidation of power in the province has likely dashed their hopes. However, while Chen Mingshu has tried to court both major factions in the Nanjing Central Committee, his political leanings remain independent of both camps.\n\nHe could be uniquely useful to Hu, due to his ties with other Fourth Army veterans in Nanjing, notably Li Jishen and Zhang Fakui. Of course, the most important ally Hu needs to keep onside is Chen Jitang and the New Guangdong Clique. While Chen may not have grand political ambitions of his own, he guards the influence he has with zeal and Hu would be a fool to bite the hand that feeds him."

 GXC.lategame.567.d: "In order to set his tone with the left and refine his rhetoric, Hu Hanmin has decided to make a speech to the KMT in Guangzhou, with Nanjing as an intended audience as well. Hu began, \"When your brother Hu Hanmin was in France, I met members of socialist parties from all over the world, I was able to answer all the questions they asked to their satisfaction, and I wrote more than a hundred thousand words which were all published in newspapers of all major cities in France. However, when I once talked with Sen Katayama, one of the leaders of the Communist Party of Japan, he asked me a question that I could not answer.\n\nHe asked 'Why does the KMT have to be divided into leftists and rightists? When you have two people together, you have to be divided into left and right, and when there is only one person left, you still have to be divided into left and right hands; do you mean that the left and right hands have to fight each other and that you have to divide left and right even with one person?' When I heard that, I felt like crying and could not answer him. Armed comrades, did we divide the KMT into leftists and rightists ourselves? or did the Syndicalists?\n\nOur party is revolutionary, and so are our party members, our revolutionary army is particularly revolutionary, and we are the entirety of the revolutionary force. The reason why we cannot allow others to divide us is just like why we cannot let others step in and step out freely of our bellies.\"\n\nDespite his reconciliatory and seemingly regretful tone, many recognise this speech as Hu indirectly criticising both Wang Jingwei's divisive leadership of the Kuomintang as well as anarchist and syndicalist intrigue. Others felt riled up regarding their feelings towards the Chinese Syndicalist League. Hu left the stage very pleased with himself, having both refined his rhetoric, and set his tone with Nanjing."

 GXC.lategame.570.t: "The 2nd Repatriated Congress"
 GXC.lategame.570.d: "With the Kuomintang rapidly ascending from a fringe insurgency to the leading contender for national leadership, the party has decided to send a clear message by hosting another party congress, this time in the ancient capital of Beijing itself. Party figures drawn from around the country and beyond, from Xinjiang to Singapore, have arrived for proceedings. Topics include the establishment of a new Ministry of Education and a National Health Administration, language reforms, national reconstruction, and even a new national anthem.\n\nHowever, underneath those talks a sense of unease pervades the Congress. Tensions between Wang Jingwei and his RCA allies and his opponents, primarily Song Qingling and the PAC, have only worsened as the prospects of unification grow and unity in turn has declined. Wang's authoritarianism and accusations of PAC insubordination have rocked the nation, even as the revolutionary government has plenty more obstacles to overcome.\n\nChief among these is the question of the Rising Sun. While the Kuomintang and the Japanese government have had some historic ties, Tokyo's opinions on Chinese nationalism have dimmed over the years. While the fall of the Zhili was to our mutual benefit, their disappointment in the Fengtian clique's inability to exploit the situation is palpable. On our end, their hold over northeastern China has grown ever more pervasive and war between the White and Red Suns seem inevitable now.\n\nCalls for action only grow, especially among those who feel the party is moving too slowly on the issue. Others however have advised caution, noting that despite the Kuomintang's quick pace of stunning victories, Japan is no paper tiger. For us in Liangguang, the prospect of freeing distant Manchuria has attracted considerable nationalist attention and is an increasingly realistic possibility.

Meant to be the pinnacle of academic study and coordinate research across the country at its highest level, planners have outlined departments in over a dozen topics both in the sciences and humanities. Widely supported both within the party and by academicians like the Chinese Science Society, the approval of its charter by the Legislative Yuan was received with considerable applause.\n\nSatellite campuses are being erected across Kuomintang controlled territory, and thanks to some heavy lobbying on our part Guangzhou has been slated to be the location of the Institute of Language and History, especially prestigious given the nationalist character of our movement. Our scholars have already begun excitedly planning an expansion with a new Institute of Physical Anthropology, but they are getting ahead of themselves.\n\nFirst we will have to make a decision of where to actually house this new institute. Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou is a logical choice since it already has a fairly large campus and a solid concentration of scholars.

The primary cause seems to be the increased appetite by the Central Government for \"special activities\". The Party's premier intelligence group is known as the Teke, an outgrowth of Zhou Enlai's fabled Red Squad. Their rivals are the Army's primary intelligence unit known as the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics, centred around Dai Chunfeng and his League of Ten. Both are ruthless enforcers of party orthodoxy with sprawling portfolios spanning foreign intelligence, counterintelligence, smuggling, tax collection (which can border on extortion), and most fearsome of all - secret police work.\n\nThe rivalry that has played out between the two groups has extended to Guangzhou where Gong Changrong of the Teke has taken on Zheng Jiemin of the BIS. Gong is a long time CSP member and insurgent leader who grew up in the United States before returning to China to participate in both the Peasant's Movement and the Hong Kong-Canton strike. Zheng Jiemin was a Whampoa Military cadet who later studied at Sun Yat-sen University in Paris. A political commissar associated with radical CRS circles, he is noted for his fondness of French trained officers.\n\nBoth men are Guangdong born but are relatively late comers to the province. Already there and boasting a slight advantage are Deng Fa, a MinGan insurgent with CSP ties, and a notorious commander of the socialist secret police. Meanwhile, Wang Yaqiao, the infamous \"King of Assassins\" proves to be another elusive force, allying himself with existing triads.

Although the high level goals of the party summarised with the three principles of Nationalism, Democracy, and Welfare, actually achieving these objectives will require what is known as the \"Three-Fold\" revolution (Political, Economic, and Social) articulated by early figures such as Hu Hanmin and revived (regardless of how the left may feel about Mr. Hu) in recent discussions about the future.

Dr. Sun himself made one last ditch effort in 1925 to negotiate, passing away from cancer in the process. By now, over a decade later, we are long past the point of compromise. Chinese unification will require war, and wars require sacrifice. The Nationalist government has begun raising war taxes preliminarily, fearing a sudden jolt would cripple the war effort should war break out with imperial powers. Stockpiles have been created, draft rolls updated, men and money raised from the people.\n\nThese policies are naturally quite unpopular even among Kuomintang bastions. After decades of instability and civil war, most Chinese families are struggling to scrape by. They have been further disillusioned by recurring corruption scandals."

 GXC.lategame.590.t: "The Liangguang Incident"
 GXC.lategame.590.d: "With the nation on the brink of a civil war, [GXC.GetLeader] has rushed to reassert calm and leadership in [GXC.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. In a grand ceremony before a crowd of hand-selected supporters and journalists, [GXC.GetAdjective] officials denounced the [CHI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] government as corrupt, tyrannical, and revisionist, brushing off accusations of treason by arguing that it was [CHI.GetLeader] who betrayed the ideals of Dr. Sun. The event concluded with a formal proclamation rejecting the [GXC.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Central Committee and calls for a new one to be established by loyal comrades.\n\nThe festivities could do little to hide the worry creeping into even the highest ranks of the administration. [GXC.GetLeader] has made a bold gamble, rebelling against the Central Government. The recent crisis at the Third Congress has shaken [CHI.GetLeader]'s political legitimacy, but it is unlikely to fundamentally alter the calculus on the battlefield. Despite [GXC.Leader]'s exhortations, there have been no high level internal defections, even as [CHI.GetLeader] cracks down on dissidents from within. The [GXC.GetAdjective] rebels can only hope others on the fringes join in the revolt, but it is no guarantee. As the artillery roars and infantry scramble into position, the fate of China will likely be determined far from Liangguang's halls of power."
 GXC.lategame.590.a: "One final battle for the future of our country!"

 GXC.lategame.591.t: "Canton Reclaims Its Leadership"
 GXC.lategame.591.d: "The city of Guangzhou (known internationally as Canton), was the home of a series of southern Chinese governments after the 1911 Revolution, including various incarnations of the Kuomintang. Many of the party's early members were drawn from there, and so if there was any city that could topple Wang Jingwei's party-state from within, it would be Guangzhou. Some of course were shocked that the Kuomintang heartland could play such a pivotal role in the destruction of the old Central Committee, sweeping away Wang loyalists and opposition alike. But those who knew the workings of [GXC.GetLeader] and the [GXC.GetRulingParty] understood that they always held resentments towards Nanjing and had dreams of a new order within the new Kuomintang order.\n\nWhat is not surprising is that [GXC.GetLeader] has proclaimed a new government and organised a new Central Executive Committee, thus seizing leadership of the old Kuomintang movement. With the old National Revolutionary Government gone, there are few who can oppose them, but their leadership is still contested. Whether or not [GXC.GetLeader] has a blissfully quick path to national unification or if there will be further conflicts over Wang Jingwei's succession will shape China for years to come."

Despite the late hour for this political turn, [GXC.GetLeader] believes Liangguang will be a powerful enough base to overcome entrenched foes in China.\n\nWhether or not this will pan out the way he hopes is another question, though there is plenty of precedent for Guangzhou leading a revolution thanks to its wealth, ready access to foreign support, and a history of maintaining large revolutionary armies. Victory however, will ultimately depend on success on the battlefield."

 GXC.lategame.592.t: "A Challenger Appears"
 GXC.lategame.592.d: "Though sidelined from the Chinese political scene for well over a decade, Hu Hanmin and the right-leaning \"Moscow\" Committee of the Kuomintang has returned home to Guangzhou. They were greeted by their host in Chen Jitang's personal mansion, who welcomed the elder statesmen of the party with a lavish banquet. At last, after months of secret communications and delicate negotiations, Governor Chen has secured their return - albeit belatedly. At the end of the night, Hu Hanmin was formally sworn in as Chairman of the Kuomintang and offered his long awaited chance to implement the political tutelage.\n\nDespite his lofty title, his powers are considerably restrained compared to the near absolute authority Sun Yat-sen claimed as Generalissimo, a title Hu briefly held after Sun's untimely death. Chen Jitang and his New Guangdong Clique faction maintain tight control over Guangdong and some of the other surrounding provinces of interest, though are largely disinterested in the wider Chinese political arena. Li Zongren and the New Guangxi Clique, though weakened, have likewise have sought to maintain the autonomy of Guangxi and other aligned provinces, a headache that will likely bedevil the party-state for generations to come.\n\nStill, the return of the Moscow Committee leaves open some faint home for a future for the party independent of the socialists that long dominated it. The returning exiles include members of the Elders Clique, older revolutionaries still aligned with Dr. Sun's more radical vision. It also includes members of the Western Hills Clique, another faction more in line with old Tongmenghui leaders like Song Jiaoren and Huang Xing. Some hope that their presence may persuade wavering centrists within the party to defect should the tide turn."
 GXC.lategame.592.a: "Maybe he can save us from socialism..."

 GXC.lategame.593.t: "Dawn of the Third Party"
 GXC.lategame.593.d: "Tan Pingshan has long waited for this moment, and at last the opportunity presented itself. Though the moment was fleeting and risks abounded, Tan realised that if there was any hope for a socialist China independent of the corruption of the Kuomintang and Chinese Syndicalist Party leaderships, he had to take action. Mobilising the full force of Liangguang against the central government, he raised his banner against Nanjing - and to the shock of many, he won!\n\nWhat banner that entails, however, remained up to discussion even through the chaotic firefights between the Central Government and Liangguang forces. Different proposals were offered to Tan, who eagerly savoured the chance to make such a meaningful (albeit ultimately symbolic) decision for the revolution.\n\nThe first would be to embrace the Provisional Action Committee's stated mission of redeeming the Kuomintang. A variant of the White Sun, Blue Sky, and Wholey Red Earth flag has already been prepared, incorporating the plough of the peasants and a gear for the workers into its design.\n\nAlternatively, allied members of the Chinese Syndicalist Party have suggested a new red flag, with a golden \"Gong\" (Translated Work or Labour) at its centre. This has been the de facto symbol of the regime in many areas to better distinguish Liangguang forces from their enemies on the battlefield. By taking leadership of the League of Chinese Syndicalists, we orient ourselves away from the failures of the Kuomintang to a new syndicalist future.\n\nFinally, there is the option of returning to Tan's roots and finally forming a truly \"Third Party\" in China, a Chinese Revolutionary Party of his own making. A red flag with a gear to represent the proletariat, a red star for the party holding them together, and three yellow stripes representing the Yellow, Yangtze, and Pearl Rivers would be perfect for this occasion.\n\nEither way, it is clear that change is coming. All that matters is the message."

 GXC.lategame.594.t: "The Liangguang Tiger Leaps"
 GXC.lategame.594.d: "As Liangguang soldiers marched north to fight another round of civil war, they cheekily adapted an old nursery rhyme (set to the tune of Frère Jacques) called \"Two Tigers\" to fit with the circumstances. This has happened before of course, Kuang Yong with the permission of Deng Yanda and Guo Moruo created the \"National Revolutionary Song\" as a marching tune on the eve of the original Northern Expedition. But this new version, dubbed the \"Agrarian Revolutionary Song\", goes like this:\n\nDown with tyrants,\nDown with tyrants,\nAnd the evil gentry,\nAnd the evil gentry,\nWe want to be the masters,\nWe want to be the masters,\nDivide the fields!\nDivide the fields!\n\nOne may wonder if the original lyrics would be a more apt metaphor. It happily describes two tigers, one without eyes (or in other versions, ears) and one without a tail. The Kuomintang is like the first tiger, running blindly without listening to the people it claims to serve. The peasants are like the second tiger, chasing after it without a tail to steady it. A most strange situation indeed.\n\nBut all the same Peng Pai, the life-long rebel, will save that second tiger. Now that he has won control over China, the only question is whether or not he will do so by taming the first one or slaying it and forging a new path."

 GXC.lategame.594.b: "Tail or no tail, the Chinese Peasants' Party leaps forward!"

 GXC.lategame.595.t: "Changing the Narrative"
 GXC.lategame.595.d: "Chen Mingshu and the New Fourth Army have always been noted for their steadiness in battle and their faithfulness to the cause, but their decision to oppose the tyranny of Nanjing has called that reputation into question. The \"Lame General\" and his clique were harshly branded as rebels, revisionist, and worse yet reactionaries.\n\nSuch a tale, especially at the hands of the deft propagandists of the left Kuomintang, proved deadly to the reputation of dozens of rivals in the past. Despite his victory in the ensuing war, General Chen needs to move fast to control the story, preemptively steering how history will remember his movement.\n\nThe most immediate narrative we can chart is that we are protectors of the true principles of the Kuomintang - worthy soldiers guarding against the encroachment of tyranny and corruption by senior members of the party. This would help us shore up our position from those attached to the Kuomintang label and make our victory easier to swallow from those who have spent decades within the party apparatus.\n\nFraming our war as an internal power struggle between Kuomintang figures has its downsides however, trivialising to some the extent of the fighting and potentially creating apathy about the final result. Some have advised we totally abandon Kuomintang symbols and identity, instead forging ourselves into a new party that seeks to take on the excesses of the Kuomintang altogether. This would be a marked break and give us a fresh start."

 ##UPC Fall of Beijing Event Intro Chain (600-629):
 GXC.lategame.600.t: "Guangzhou Overcomes Beijing"
 GXC.lategame.600.d: "In the end, it was not negotiations but military might that brought Federalism to the forefront of Chinese politics. The Guangzhou government has managed to march their armies from Canton to Beijing, one of the rare south to north unifications in Chinese history. Some may say they have avenged the oppression the northerners wrought on the south.\n\nIf there was any gloating among the Guangzhou high command, it was muted as Chen Jiongming and his entourage toured Beijing. The city has been devastated by conflict, many residents have fled to avoid the fighting, and the marvelous capital suffered severe looting before more disciplined units could restore order.\n\nThe situation is little better elsewhere in China. Millions have been displaced, and while most will return home in the coming weeks as the political situation settles down, many more will have no homes to return to. The economy has plunged into a recession as doubts swirl about the new government's ability to pay back vital loans and maintain order.\n\nResistance continues, with some units refusing to lay down their arms and vowing to continue the fight. But the Guangzhou Army is exhausted - overextended after a long campaign northwards. Many of their best divisions have been thinned out, losing troops to casualties, attrition, desertion, or garrisons. Others have been swamped by low quality militias and integrated warlord units, diminishing their overall fighting effectiveness.\n\nThe Federalists have secured their hard won victory, but now the question is whether or not their system will be able to survive the peace in the challenging days ahead."
 GXC.lategame.600.a: "One step closer to unification."

 GXC.lategame.601.t: "The Second Federalist Conference"
 GXC.lategame.601.d: "Beijing has fallen and with it, the old Beiyang Republic is on its last legs. While remnants of the old government may linger on in various redoubts or in exile, for many this is a clear sign that a new age is dawning on the nation. While resistance to [ROOT.GetNameDef] continues, Chen Jiongming has felt confident enough to host another Federalist Conference in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].\n\nThis time, a much larger guest list is expected. While the first Federalist conference held in Guangzhou in the post-Zhili era desperately sought the attendance of various figures - targeting prestigious intellectuals and liberal figures as well as regional warlords - this time the various stakeholders around China are desperately clamouring to get in. Few would like to be left out of proceedings, and many old Beiyang National Assemblymen seek to retain their positions in the incoming government.\n\nFor Chen Jiongming - this is his moment of glory. Once a mere regional figure that piqued some national interest, he is now perhaps the strongest power in all of China. It was he who rallied the moribund Federalist movement, it is he who built and marched an army to Beijing, and now it is he who will effectively decide the makeup of the new provisional Assembly.\n\nWith all this power comes greater scrutiny. His promises of a new, fairer republic were never really put to the test until now, and many of those liberal intellectuals and federalist governors who he had courted are now expecting him to live up to his words. Whispers have been going around the republic as the politically minded mull whether or not there will be (or even can be) meaningful elections in these circumstances, and whether or not President Chen will go the way of his predecessors in authoritarianism.\n\nFor now however, the question of the day is whether or not the assemblymen elected under his predecessors' regime will be allowed to retain their seats - a meaningful question as the government balances new and old."
 GXC.lategame.601.a: "The old order was rank with corruption and decadence."
 GXC.lategame.601.b: "The unity of north and south will heal the nation."

 GXC.lategame.602.t: "The Spirit of Great Patriotism"
 GXC.lategame.602.d: "Perhaps the second most visible figure in Guangzhou is Zhang Junmai, who has recently published his treatise, \"The Spirit of Great Patriotism.\" In it, he outlines his case for a strong and united but also democratic government in the coming years, even amid continued conflict and reconstruction.\n\nHe wrote of the British unity governments during the Great War, where in the face of danger there was \"a politics of leadership\" where the wartime Prime Ministers were granted extraordinary powers but with the approval of the Parliament, the people, and all political parties. While in normal times, British politicians were free to pursue their personal and party interests and the people enjoyed considerable political freedoms, in wartime civil liberties were sacrificed in the namesake \"spirit of great patriotism\" as all united for victory.\n\nZhang also pointed out that even during the war, there were peaceful ways for government change - with Lloyd George taking over during the middle of the conflict and H. H. Asquith peacefully entering the opposition. The prevalence of rule of law allowed for a clear sense of \"the rules of the game\", allowing a sense of fair competition free of political violence and meddling by the military. Democratic traditions thus allowed the British people to trust their powerful wartime government.\n\nAware that his argument is undercut by the British Revolution, he also cites examples of parties in Germany, Austria, France and elsewhere transcending party lines during a crisis. Despite his overly rosy assessment, his prescription for the republic reflects a growing consensus among progressives: in order to cultivate a similar spirit of great patriotism in a nation lacking democratic tradition, China must respect civil liberties, expand the power of the national assembly, and implement political reform. Otherwise, as the central government begins to claw back power from the warlords, it will begin to clash with democratic values."
 GXC.lategame.602.a: "Then surely we must begin to cultivate this spirit in order to save the nation!"
 GXC.lategame.602.b: "Zhang writes well, but like many Liangists his obsession with statism will be his undoing."

 GXC.lategame.603.t: "The China Democratic League"
 GXC.lategame.603.d: "Zhang Junmai, the sometimes pragmatic Liangist, may be willing to hedge his bets when it comes to President Chen, but his allies in the Federation of Chinese Democratic Parties are much bolder. Though the FCDP fell apart after the 1936 Seven Gentlemen Incident, national unification has also brought the movement back together. They have dropped two characters (Zheng Tuan, which emphasised their party-dominated nature) from their name, rebranding as the China Democratic League - implying one unified coalition.\n\nLuo Longji has published \"the Draft Principles of the Democratic League\" on behalf of the CDL, which was effectively a draft national constitution. It demanded a bicameral legislature, with a Senate elected from the people and a People's Council elected by provincial assemblies. It included provisions for Federalism, division of power, universal and equal suffrage, access to education, protection of civil rights, centralisation of the military, and a mixed economy with the ultimate goal of a peaceful transition to socialism.\n\nThis was followed shortly afterwards with an even more forceful document entitled \"Views and Policies of the China Democratic League Regarding the Present Situation,\" urgently pressing the matter. \"The need for China to become a democracy has passed beyond the stage of theory; it is a fact,\" it cried, \"the formation of a democracy system must not be postponed until after reconstruction, if democracy is not realised during this period, then what we shall obtain afterwards will not be democracy but division and ruin of our country.\"\n\nThe statement has been criticised by the PIP, who see it as almost implicitly a rebuke of Chen and his plans for a stable transition into a democracy - many of the President's allies have decried it as a formula for anarchy. The escalating war of words has resulted in Zhang Junmai formally announcing the DSP's withdrawal from the PIP dominated GRA, and his formal assumption as leader of the CDL."
 GXC.lategame.603.a: "This is a brazen power play by idiotic ingrates!"
 GXC.lategame.603.b: "This is China's only hope for democracy!"

 GXC.lategame.604.t: "The Northerners Respond"
 GXC.lategame.604.d: "As the GRA and CDL exchange harsh words, their northern counterparts see both risk and opportunity. While some northern politicians have already joined a side (either out of opportunism or ideological affinity), most retain their prior party or clique identification. Moreover, many of their leaders have not yet committed to joining the new government, adopting a wait and see attitude.\n\nEver since the defection of nearly one hundred Beiyang Assemblymen to Guangzhou in 1917, kicking off the Constitutional Protection Movement, northern and southern politics have taken marked different tracks. Even the nominal Zhili Unification failed to fully heal the divide. Generally more conservative than the south, Beiyang's largest formal party was that of Liang Qichao - the latest iteration going by the Democratic Constitutionalist Party label.\n\nBut Beiyang politics was not party-based, most politicians ran as (and prided themselves as) independents and only informally joined wider networks. The Zhili organised the Harmony Association as their political machine, with the Young China Party forming a symbiotic relationship with it. Other larger factions included the National Salvation Federation, the Old Political Science Clique, the Rural Reconstruction Association, and Endeavor Society.\n\nTheir interest in the squabbles of the southerners would be marginal if it were not for the growing centralisation of power around the President's office. Though Chen has ordered local provincial assemblies to convene along Federalist lines, in practice he has amassed considerable control (deliberately or not) through the army's \"Bandit Suppression Zones,\" which report directly to his military headquarters. With prior northern leaders having gone on a similar route to authoritarianism, many fear this is the best chance they will get to check Presidential power.\n\nBattle lines are being drawn, and the fiery NSF has already joined like-minded CDL. But the others wrestle with a perilous dilemma."
 GXC.lategame.604.a: "The old FCDP parties must unite again to fight for democracy!"
 GXC.lategame.604.b: "The Beiyang parties must help guide the President to reform like they have always done."

 GXC.lategame.605.t: "Guangzhou at the Crossroads"
 GXC.lategame.605.d: "Zhang Junmai was prophetic in his prediction that unification would lead to tensions between centralisation and democracy. But his gambit, probably only intended to shore up his bargaining position in coalition talks, has spiralled into something far more. A democratic wave has swept across the intelligentsia - with writers denouncing all prior Federalist discourse on democracy as empty words. To stand against it risks being swept away by the tide, to stand with it might spell doom...or opportunity.\n\nIn Chen Jiongming's camp, the discourse has escalated far beyond what they had hoped when the conference was first called. Rather than a ringing endorsement of Chen's National Reconstruction Plan, it has drawn demands for further democratisation - extremely prematurely given the work that still needs to be done drafting provincial constitutions, restoring stability and bringing an end to foreign imperialism.\n\nThe narrative has slipped outside of his control - northern press outlets have pointed out that he was elected by an assembly that barely represented the south. If he does not allow for a new vote with the northerners involved, he would mark himself a hypocrite. The CDL's position is not very secure either - though they claim to speak on behalf of the masses, most of them are academics and professionals too out of touch to even realise how little they know of the common people. And the military is certainly not pleased at the attacks on their leader or the destabilisation of the republic they have fought so hard for.\n\nTo ratchet down tensions, Chen Jiongming and Zhang Junmai have scheduled a private meeting. They have both agreed that the assembly must hold a new vote on the President, but there is a growing demand by progressives to call new assembly elections as well. New elections would take time, spell risks for both men, and pose risks for the integrity of the republic as a whole. But their democratic credentials might be called into question otherwise."
 GXC.lategame.605.a: "After discussions, the gentlemen agreed to call for a national general election."
 GXC.lategame.605.b: "The two men settle on an assembly vote and a renewed unity government."

 GXC.lategame.606.t: "A Wartime Political Truce"
 GXC.lategame.606.d: "The outbreak of war would cloud democratic elections in any republic, but in one as fragile as China the prospect of national elections while bullets fly and artillery shells boom is daunting. Already there is talks of suspending the planned elections, with many commentators castigating politicians for focusing on political jockeying rather than uniting against their common foes.\n\nHoping to assuage these concerns, Zhang Junmai has published \"A Political Truce for the Purpose of Reconstructing the Nation,\" in which he once again recalls how Western Democracies (particularly the German and Anglo-American ones he and his allies are more familiar with) are able to operate even during wartime. Common to them is a general respect for the constitution, the ability to peacefully adjust and coordinate plans and proposals between parties, the government's continued concern for the people's wellbeing, and their nations' defences being capable of resisting aggression.\n\nHis article then proposed not only a political truce between the various parties in the National Assembly, but also the promotion of a new spirit akin to Japan's Meiji reforms. Good ideas are to be followed, bad policies corrected, old and outdated ideas discarded, and democracy is to be integrated into everyday life.\n\nHis words are flowery but ultimately say little about whether or not elections should go forward in these trying times. For now at least, they will go on as planned, but perhaps what he did not say was more telling than what he did."
 GXC.lategame.606.a: "How can elections be held in these conditions?"

 ##UPC Dem Election Chain (630-659):
 GXC.lategame.630.t: "The First Federal Elections"
 GXC.lategame.630.d: "As agreed, national-wide elections are to be called (or at least the territories under Guangzhou's control), lauded in aligned press outlets as a victory for Chinese democracy. But the scope of this first election is expected to be a lot more limited than idealists hope. It has already been cast as effectively a referendum on Chen Jiongming's leadership, who will serve for the duration of the election. Although over a dozen parties are expected to participate in elections, the Presidency has become a two way race before it has even begun.\n\nWith no enshrined national constitution for the Federal government yet, elections have defaulted to the old Beiyang system with a Federalist spin. Voting is indirect, with local assemblies (some holding fresh and/or fair elections, others not) selecting representatives to go to the capital. This system would normally be expected to favor the status quo, however the excitement of these new elections has caused civic groups to mobilise to increase turnout where they can.\n\nZhang Junmai, despite numerous personal disputes with other members of the old FCDP, is understood to be their best chance of unseating President Chen. He was reluctantly voted in as Chairman of the China Democratic League and has become the de facto top of the ticket. The CDL, though ostensibly rebranded as a unified party, remains a loose bloc of centre-left progressives dominated by Zhang's old DSP comrades.\n\nThe Grand Republican Alliance has also been energised, a powerful liberal-conservative bloc dominated by the PIP. They are expected to easily nominate the incumbent President to run for re-election. However, Chen has yet to announce his candidacy. To run is expected, and probably the stabler path. Chen of course also has his ego, believing himself to be the savior China needs. But with his age beginning to wear down on him, he is said to be mulling stepping aside in favor of his protégé Chen Qiyou - a fresh start but a risky one. His legacy hangs in the balance."

 GXC.lategame.631.body: "The Zhejiang-born Zhang Junmai has selected the Guangdong-born political elder Xu Fulin, perhaps reinforcing the outsized importance of the province in the coming election. It is widely expected that should the CDL win, Zhang will appoint his long-time friend and deputy Zhang Dongsun as Prime Minister - likely a controversial choice given his socialist views.\n\nBoth sides have consolidated the top of their respective tickets around their own core allies in the old PIP and DSP, but they will also be ultimately dependent on their nation-spanning coalitions in the GRA and CDL to win. The GRA is an amalgamation of various Federalist parties including Tang Jiyao's People's Government Party, Chu Fucheng's Zhejiang Autonomy Movement, Zhao Hengti's People's Renewal Society, Xiong Kewu's Provincial Federal Autonomy Preparation Office, and several smaller groups.\n\nThe CDL, while proclaiming to be a united party now, in practice remains a federation of parties including the Luo Longji's Crescent Moon Society, Huang Hanliang's China National Democratic Construction Association, Ma Xulun's China Association for Promoting Democracy, Shen Junru's National Salvation Federation, and several other civic groups."

 GXC.lategame.632.d: "With most of the nation's attention on the Presidential candidates, the attention the GRA and CDL have received has taken the wind out of the sails of other parties. With little room to operate and doubts that the army high command (still overwhelmingly in the hands of Cantonese officers) would tolerate any other candidates, most of the luminaries of the other major parties in China have decided to sit out of the process altogether - ceding the spotlight to Chen and Zhang.\n\nThough their leaders could afford to bide their time, the lower ranking party members and activists of these groups can ill afford the loss of patronage and influence not campaigning would entail. Many smaller parties have folded into the GRA or CDL, but the larger DCP and YCP can afford to field candidates to attempt to secure influence in the post-election political environment. Navigating the limits of Federalist democracy, they hope to secure enough seats to use their leverage in future talks.\n\nMany, many other local politicians and their associated political machines are also running, braving fears of corruption and political intimidation (and perhaps engaging in some of their own) in hopes of surviving the new era. The lack of big names in the race has created a sense of dynamism in a previously ossified political environment, opening up the arena a little bit for outsiders to participate as well.\n\nSome socialists have also sought to run for office, some out of protest and in hopes of challenging the new federalist government and others out of a genuine belief that they can reform the government from within. But they have been banned in virtually all races, either de jure or de facto. The Central Committee(s) have denounced participation in Beiyang elections in the past, and continue to do so with ours.\n\nThough the GRA and CDL have effectively carved up the political system they founded between one another, it is clear that those left on the outside will not go down without a fight."

 GXC.lategame.633.d: "In many ways, the GRA and CDL are cut from similar idiosyncratic cloths, with vague populist agendas of political reform, a mixed economic system, and Chinese nationalism. This free-styling approach worked well on the road to unification, drawing supporters from all corners, but as elections unfold it has proven difficult to meaningfully distinguish the two or set cohesive party identities.\n\nBoth Chen Jiongming and Zhang Junmai historically have made overtures to the left (including dabbling in extremist ideologies such as anarchism and Marxism) but relied on conservative power structures to stay relevant - synthesising moderate, reformist, and what some criticise as diluted platforms. This legacy endures in their respective parties and the lack of clear direction that pervades both the GRA and CDL has been worsened by their absorbing of various smaller parties into their blocs.\n\nUltimately, the direction of the new political system will probably rest on the GRA rather than the CDL. In addition to being the party in power, the CDL is generally seen as comfortably to the left of the GRA - the PIP arguably being the furthest left of the GRA while the DSP sits closer to the left-centre of the CDL relatively speaking.\n\nVeering to the left to compete with the CDL for progressive and even socialist votes would probably help the GRA with the masses but will alienate the conservatives. The CDL would probably reposition themselves as a Democratic movement, attempting to court various liberals and constitutionalists in the centre-right - including alliances with the DCP and YCP. This would likely cast the situation as a referendum on Chen Jiongming's Presidency and alleged authoritarianism.\n\nTacking to the right would help the GRA secure the conservative vote (probably at the expense of existing right-wing parties) but leave the CDL free to operate across the left. This would likely create a more typical left vs right dynamic in Chinese politics."

 GXC.lategame.634.d: "The China Democratic League got off to an energetic start as an upstart, insurgent party challenging the establishment but its traditional issues (inherited from the FCDP before them) with organisation has hampered their ability to mobilise votes. Although their operation headquarters are in Guangzhou, their legal headquarters are in Beijing (still officially capital of China) and it is said their de facto capital is in Shanghai given how many of their members have ties there.\n\nInfighting between the CDL's constituent parties, has resulted in the 13 person standing committee and 33 member central executive committee both being expanded to 18 and 66 respectively. The DSP dominates the Secretary-Generalship, though has distributed seats in the other committees to the Crescent Moon Society, China National Democratic Construction Association, the National Salvation Federation, and the China Association for Promoting Democracy.\n\nTheir local branches imagine themselves as \"groups of pioneers\", \"dynamos of the democratic movement\", and \"vanguards holding high the guiding torches of the multitude,\" but the CDL remains fundamentally a movement dominated by the intellectual and professional classes. Many question whether or not they will be truly able to connect with the working people they claim to represent.\n\nThe DSP and NSF are probably furthest to the left with a reformist socialist bent, albeit the former has a cultural conservative side as well. The CMS, CNDCA, and CAPD are more liberal in orientation, leading to some clashes. However, nothing divides the CDL more than their pragmatic alliances with the various regional warlords who have sought to resist the Yue Army's hegemony. Their protection and funding has allowed the CDL to grow unmolested by suspicious central authorities and actually ensure their candidates are even allowed on ballots, but has left them beholden to warlord interests."

The largest of these are Tang Jiyao's People's Government Party, Chu Fucheng's Zhejiang Autonomy Movement, Zhao Hengti's People's Renewal Society, and Xiong Kewu's Provincial Federal Autonomy Preparation Office - which mainly operate out of their home provinces and have a regionalist, personalist slant towards their founders.\n\nStrengthening the PIP's hold over the GRA during elections would probably help maintain party discipline and allow them to build support for their more progressive, albeit sometimes idiosyncratic agenda. But the GRA is generally less popular than its constituent parties in the individual provinces, and alienating the others is likely to damage the GRA's political machine and risk defections to smaller parties and independents.\n\nThe GRA does benefit from being Chen Jiongming's party, with the various political patronage networks, charity and civic groups, and military ties Chen has cultivated. His legacy may be strong enough that the party does not need to offer a cohesive programme to the people - just a reminder of who built this republic."

Confident of the success of his movement, Chen Jiongming hosted another major Federalist conference in [UPC.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] promoting unification, this time from a position of strength.\n\nStrength in China, draws ready opposition however. Chen's Yue Army has had an outsized influence in the reconstruction of liberated provinces, molding local politics in its image and continuing to exert influence as they battle local \"bandits.\" This has drawn the ire of many warlords, who have circled their wagons in order to protect their autonomy. It has worried many of his democratic allies, who have banded together in the form of the China Democratic League in a bid to stave off authoritarianism.\n\nAfter careful negotiations, President Chen and CDL leader Zhang Junmai have agreed to new national assembly elections, to be held in the next six months. The nature of the elections are a lot narrower than many had hoped - despite dozens of parties participating, the race narrowed down to Chen's Grand Republican Alliance and Zhang's China Democratic League before it even began.\n\nAs a regional government with significant autonomy from the central government, [FROM.GetName] has a lot more freedom to operate. Supporting a slate of GRA or CDL aligned candidates would likely help them a lot in the coming elections.

Senior Yue Army Clique officers have moved to \"broker a compromise\"between the GRA and CDL, suspending elections and extending the existing parliament's term until after reunification and drafting a new constitution.

Zhang Junmai has been appointed to head a committee conducting constitutional research, with the intention that he will lead the drafting process. He has also won the promise that he will be consulted for major government appointments, and has won jobs for his close allies and protégés.\n\nThe real winner, however, is Chen Jiongming - who once again is able to bask in the glory of being China's national savior, a role he has been determined to keep. Distributing government posts to the CDL to him is not a concession, but a reflection of his magnanimity and his power to give gifts to those who support him. With his primary challenge to his legitimacy mollified, at least for the time period, this hero of the Federalist republic will be able to carry on with his plans to shape the republic as he sees fit."

While the decision to compromise might have been justifiable, Zhang agreed to the deal unilaterally without consultation from the other CDL factions or even within his own DSP.\n\nThis is hardly the first time. Zhang's loyalists are overwhelming his pupils, enabling him to behave autocratically. While some defend him as \"almost a saint\", others denounce him as being unrealistically utopian and hardheadedly ineffectual. Many of his peers within the DSP left long ago, including Luo Longji, Pan Guangdan, and Fei Xiaotong. This latest controversy has caused Zhang Dongsun and many northerners to walk out as well.\n\nThe worst is yet to come. Many DSP functionaries rely on patronage posts for a living. The few granted by Chen have been monopolised by Zhang's inner circle, including his brother Zhang Gongquan and old guard leader Xu Fulin. Younger members who lack the connections needed to secure a coveted ministerial job have banded together under Sun Baogang who attacked Zhang's dictatorial leadership in a recent party meeting. He accused Zhang of surrounding himself with \"Xiaoren\" (petty and small-minded men). When Feng Jinbai, one of Zhang's loyalists, demanded to know who Sun was referring to, Sun exclaimed \"You!\" - causing a shouting match until the meeting was adjourned early.\n\nHoping to resolve tensions, Zhang resigned as leader of the DSP (but not the CDL) and attempted to push Xu Fulin to take his place. This has only caused further splits as even some of Zhang's students oppose the move. Sun has formed a \"Reform Faction\" of the DSP, and the Eight Standing Committee and the Xiang Guofu factions have arisen in opposition to Xu's leadership. Observers have bemoaned that Zhang simply is \"neither an organiser himself nor a man able to pick capable men to organise for him.\""

They have found ready backers in the various warlords and strongmen who have joined the Guangzhou Government thanks to their promises of regional autonomy but now chafe under the restrictions imposed by the central government.\n\nIn some respects, this push and pull was inevitable. The Federalist Movement was built to unite the various free provinces under one banner in order to resist the dictates of the tyrannical Beiyang and Kuomintang regimes. It united a diverse collection of southern and eastern strongmen and intellectuals with a mutual interest in preserving their freedoms as a third force. But as the Chen Jiongming government seeks to implement its deeper political, economic, and military reforms, tensions have bubbled to the surface. Many militarists seek to re-establish their control over their provinces and plenty are also genuinely concerned over Yue corruption and weakness in face of external threats.\n\nThe CDL has a large slate of provinces to choose from. Though the Yue Army has played a considerable role in the reconstruction of many \"liberated\" provinces, the rapid expansion of Guangzhou territory has forced them to rely on local forces and power holders. In addition to their traditional strongholds on the East Coast, the DSP had pre-existing small chapters in the North, including in the Shanxi and Fengtian Cliques, the CDL (building off their FCDP origins) similarly has contacts in ex-Zhili territory.

While he acknowledged that the former must take priority, he critiqued Jiang's belief that China lacked an essential Age of Autocracy and Ding's belief that a democracy could not effectively utilise China's experts.\n\nZhang Junmai argued that China was closer to early modern rather than feudal Europe. Like his mentor Liang Qichao, he argued unlike Europe, that China's large size meant merely having a revolution in its capital was insufficient because of powerful outlying provinces. Furthermore, its ignorant people are not yet ready to assume their positions as \"masters in deciding right and wrong and deciding who should assume power and who should step down.\"\n\nZhang's proposed government sought to address the failings of 19th Century parliamentary democracy. To him, it made the legislature too strong to be effective in the modern age where executive power is the most important element within a state. Their roles must be clearly delineated - the popularly elected national assembly ought to draw up and vote on an immutable Five Year Plan. Ensuing parliaments will still convene but their legislation must adhere to this plan and not \"shake up the government\". The cabinet, drawn from across party lines, are to be appointed and dismissed solely on the basis of administrative efficiency - once removed they are to be replaced by another of the same party.\n\nThis technocratic \"National Democracy\" must embody the spirit of national unity, be capable of acting forcefully, and concentrate authority.

The growth of Chen Jiongming's Guangdong Clique was not an even or steady one, especially with Chen losing power in 1925-1926 and having to rebuild it across another decade.\n\nThe expansion of his government from Guangzhou to Beijing has been even more dramatic, vastly outstripping the ability of his core Haifeng followers or their expanded organisations in the Yue Army, Public Interest Party, and Guangdong Grain Industry Maintenance Association to govern. The petty differences between Chen's sometimes feuding underlings have become irrelevant, as they and even other Cantonese factions like Chen Lianbo's AACSG have become lumped together in the national consciousness as Chen Jiongming's \"Yue Clique\".\n\nThough President Chen and his close followers would deny (or at least downplay) the existence of any \"Yue Clique\", insisting that their movement is a national one that transcends provincial borders and is Federalist, not regionalist - resentment has built up all the same. Those feeling shut out by the Yue guanxi networks resent the perceived Cantonese favoritism for important jobs in the military and bureaucracy. Even the positions granted to the CDL and other parties in the National Unity Government tend to end up in the hands of southerners with early connections to the Federalist movement.\n\nThere has also been a marked rise in armed resistance movements around the country, buoyed by intellectual and warlord discontent. The central army (dominated by Yue Army Clique officers) has been deployed more and more to suppress \"banditry\" by leftist rebels, using draconian measures and often sidelining local governments - creating the perception that they are trampling on provincial autonomy.

It demanded the end of authoritarian rule by the \"Yue Clique\", the drafting of a new constitution and the establishment of a new coalition government that included all parties in good faith to realise democracy. Nine other points discussed civil liberties, the release of political prisoners, the ending of secret police forces, the abolishment of penal labour camps, and the building of democratic institutions.\n\nUnlike other publications during the war, this manifesto was drafted without consultation from the GRA, said nothing of the role of Chen Jiongming in the post-war republic, and is far more concrete in its details. Though the ideas presented are nothing new or inflammatory and does not name any specific group to actually execute it, the intention appears clear - that the CDL expects the right to operate independently of the GRA once the emergency clears.\n\nWord of this proclamation has reached the President's desk and it comes amid fears of a new wave of censorship. To allow it to be released to the general public would likely inflame tensions ahead of what should be a joyful celebration of the end of the war and imminent reunification. To suppress it would likely drive the CDL's intellectuals into the arms of radicals as they lose faith on the prospect of a peaceful democratic transition."

 GXC.lategame.720.t: "Zhang Junmai and the Culture Wars"
 GXC.lategame.720.d: "In intellectual spheres, Zhang Junmai has a dual reputation as both a progressive democrat and a cultural and moral conservative. While initially supportive of the New Culture Movement, as it began to drift towards leftist iconoclasm, Zhang began to criticise it both on humanistic socialist grounds and from a conservative perspective emphasising traditional Confucian life-philosophy.\n\nThis also shaped his outlook on Westernisation. Zhang extensively studied and communicated with Western scholars like Eduard Bernstein, Karl Kautsky, Philipp Scheidemann, Karl Korsch, Rudolf Christoph Eucken, and Harold Laski, but he also opposed the excessive westernisation and anti-Confucianism of liberal thinkers like Hu Shih and Ding Wenjiang. While distancing himself from traditionalist reactionarism, Zhang argued that there is a crisis of modernity both socioeconomically and spiritually.\n\nZhang argued that Confucianism and modernity are not merely compatible but synergistic. He believed that its ethos can be separated from flawed institutionalism, and that its universal benevolence can guide the people. China must be able to harmonise old with new, freedom with order, and science with culture and ethics in order for all of these concepts to flourish.\n\nTo Zhang, nationalism is both a pragmatic extension of realist international politics and a collectivist drive to transform a people. He has compared China to the ascendant Germany: a century ago, it was a failed state suffering from Napoleonic invasion. If China is to imitate their rise to dominance, it needs radical reform in education, morality, and national spirit.\n\nChina's future is not modernist totalitarianism or reactionary autocracy, but a pluralistic democracy guided by moral intellectuals who could balance traditional ethics with modern progress. Beiyang tyranny undermined the legal institutions needed for democracy, while New Culture iconoclasm destroyed the cultural foundations for it. The new republic must work to undo the damage."

 GXC.lategame.721.t: "The DSP's Battle with Marxism"
 GXC.lategame.721.d: "The DSP's ascent to power has come at the expense of their revolutionary rivals, completing a decades long intellectual feud. Zhang Junmai's admiration of German social democracy and his studies of the French and British revolutions turned him away from Marxism. Upon his return to China, he strongly opposed the CSP and KMT's alliances with the Internationale and embrace of vanguardism. \"How can those who are described as loving freedom,\" he asked rhetorically, \"not raise the masses and enable them to progress together, but on the contrary pray for the appearance of a government by heroes?\"\n\nHe engaged Chen Duxiu in the 1920s \"Debate Over Science and a Philosophy of Life\", where the latter cursed him and declared that \"we believe that only objective material causes can change society, can explain history, and can determine one's philosophy of life\" before challenging Zhang and others to prove any truth beyond science. Zhang responded scathingly that Karl Marx was unable to escape the dated belief that social evolution had definite laws that could be applied through the scientific method. Marx claimed that societal evolution was controlled by economic factors, but spent most of his life writing propaganda - relying on human strength to bring change. Zhang maintained that Western European revolutions were primarily caused by human strength rather than cold economics, and continues to mark the Marxists as his ideological enemies.\n\nFor others in the DSP, the situation is more nuanced. Zhang Dongsun for example has an ambivalent attitude towards historical materialism, arguing for a wait and see attitude towards the supposedly inevitable class warfare. He argues that China has not yet progressed to an industrial society with clear proletariat and bourgeoisie, and repudiated the idea of an armed uprising since it would not be led by labour leaders but bandits, soldiers and lumpenproletariat. They hope to find a way to avoid class warfare through humanist guild socialism."

 #UPC PIP Focus Events (730-739)
 GXC.lategame.730.t: "Evolving Towards Utopia"
 GXC.lategame.730.d: "In the 1920s Chen Jiongming contributed to the anarchist-inspired Minxing Bao, presenting an idealistic outlook for the future. In it, he described a new world that has evolved beyond social darwinism and has freed itself from corrupt old institutions in favor of spiritual regeneration and a new, egalitarian society. This new world would be one where boundaries between states, nations, and even individuals have been erased - recalling the traditional Chinese utopian ideal of Datong (the Great Harmony).\n\nDespite the world's brokenness, Chen rejected nationalism. He argued that nations are only transitory institutions, and nationalism a tool for ambitious men to fool their people and oppress others abroad. For strong nations, nationalism is an excuse for aggression and for weak ones it is a short term tool to awaken their people to the fight for survival. But it soon corrupts even the weak, turning them arrogant and cruel - he asks rhetorically which of today's great powers have not climbed up from being weak yesterday?\n\nChen argued that nationalism cannot be used in a restrained manner. It will either fail to be effective or grow out of control. In particular he condemns Nietzschean militarism, which he believes threatens to devastate the world and enslave mankind. Instead, Chen argues that men have a natural capacity for fraternal love, and that love should be used not merely to love a nation but to love all of mankind. He further argued that China has a special role to play in healing the \"crippled\" evolution of the world. They must reform the human mind, reform their nation, and one day lead the world to a \"socialism of all mankind.\"\n\nDecades later, this sort of idealism remains elusive. China has been reunified through considerable bloodshed and the rising tide of nationalism seems unstoppable in China and around the world. Chen and his movement have changed considerably. But sometimes, the PIP recalls its more idealistic roots as China turns a new page."

 GXC.lategame.731.t: "The Guangdong Educational Model"
 GXC.lategame.731.d: "Chinese culture has always prized education, but Guangdong prides itself as being the first province to have mandatory public education for both genders. Its Constitution obligates the government to provide all boys and girls at least six years of free public education starting at age 7.\n\nGuangdong adopted a 6-3-3 system, one that has become standard nation-wide. This means 6 years of primary school learning morality, composition, arithmetic, handicraft, reading, music, gymnastics, science, history, geography, and both Mandarin and English. The 3 years middle school curriculum covers morality, Chinese, mathematics, English, history, geography, sciences, arts, music, gymnastics, and homemaking for girls and handicraft for boys. Lastly, highschoolers would receive 3 years of education along three career tracks: college preparation, homemaking, or primary school teaching.\n\nGuangdong historically funded study-abroad programs in Japan, America, France, Britain, Germany, and Russia - including partnerships with elite international universities. At home, Guangdong's education budget was also used for a bureau of translation, an oratory institute for the training of public speakers, institutes for the homeless, night schools for workers, and schools for arts, libraries, and museums.\n\nKeeping these programs funded in practice has always been a challenge and likely will continue to be one. Though the Guangdong Constitution mandated a large portion of the public budget be spent on education and explicitly not used for military expenditures, the needs of the military and the state have often taken priority. And while intellectuals and reformers of all stripes celebrate the expanded attention to public education, corruption and incompetence has frequently siphoned funding from reaching China's students."

 #UPC Yue Focus Events (740-749)
 GXC.lategame.740.t: "Federalism and the Baojia System"
 GXC.lategame.740.d: "As Guangzhou marched towards unification, its army was forced to administer large swaths of \"liberated\" territories leading to a patchwork of systems across and within provinces. This has caused tension and made implementing nation-wide reforms difficult.\n\nIn areas where the local provincial administration was generally sympathetic, they were usually allowed to remain in place albeit under varying degrees of supervision by the military, dominated by old Yue Army figures. In areas suspected of disloyalty, local governments were reconstructed from the ground up, with the Yue Army installing local collaborators and even direct loyalists into significant positions of power - wrapping village, county, and even provincial power structures around themselves.\n\nParticularly notorious are the \"Bandit Suppression Zones\" established by the army. Taking cues from the older Ming and Qing prefectures and circuits, magistrates in these zones have been given extensive executive powers at the expense of local leaders. They have been ordered to communicate up and down the military hierarchy, bypassing local assemblies. The military has also restored the traditional Baojia militias, empowering local leaders and officials (usually gentrymen and their levies) to organise armed patrols against these \"bandits.\"\n\nThough lauded by the President and his officers for increasing efficiency, increasing government revenues and decreasing overhead, promoting stability, and allowing for the education of the people without interference, it has drawn backlash from all directions. The warlords and regionalists resent the centralisation of power these bandit suppression zones have allowed and are resisting efforts by government magistrates to control local administration.\n\nFor many liberal intellectuals, these programs are a bastardisation of years of calls for local government reforms. Accusations of corruption, lack of accountability, and excessive force have soured their opinions on these zones."

###Section 4e (800-999): Late Game NPA Political Events

### NPA Fall of Beijing Events (800-829):
 GXC.lategame.800.t: "The March on Beijing"
 GXC.lategame.800.d: "On Christmas Day 1915, military forces loyal to the Republic denounced Yuan Shikai, the self-proclaimed Hongxian Emperor. After suffering major defeats on the battlefield against a coalition of forces led by Cai E, Tang Jiyao, Li Liejun, and Lu Rongting - Yuan abdicated but stayed on as President. The brief war lasted throughout the spring and into the summer until Yuan's abrupt death concluded hostilities.\n\nThough it ended the monarchy, the National Protection War did little to prevent China's descent into civil war. A second National Protection Alliance was called to liberate the country. Unlike the first war, they successfully marched onto the North.\n\nBeijing is now ours but with huge swathes of territory under the National Protection Army comes significantly more problems. Towns and villages lie in devastation from the furious fighting, civilians have reported their crops, livestock, and property plundered and looted, and banditry roams unopposed in regions absent military authority. Furthermore, [ROOT.GetNameDef]'s economy, designed to enjoy the richness of an independent Liangguang, now buckles under the weight of controlling the former national government of China.\n\nIt is a difficult time but also a dynamic one. For the first time in years, the Northern and Southern governments are finally united under one Republican banner. Politicians from across the country will be arriving in [GXC.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to discuss the forthcoming plans for the new country. Foreign observers from major countries will likely also be present in documenting the event and presenting to their countries news of China's recent unification as reunification fever washes across China."
 GXC.lategame.800.a: "The coalition victorious at last."

 GXC.lategame.801.t: "Dealing with Beiyang"
 GXC.lategame.801.d: "Beijing has fallen to a coalition of warlords from the South and the tides of power have significantly changed, but there are many who are unwilling to see vestiges of the regime fall completely into oblivion. Where there are still ways to go before unification, [ROOT.GetNameDef] eager to establish their firm hold over China - they have gotten to work in stabilising the northern administrations.\n\nAs the seat of national governance, various parties and political groups have made Beijing their home for the last few years. The largest parties are the Democratic Constitutionalist Party (descendants of Liang Qichao's movement and recently rebranded), the nationalist Young China Party, the Political Science Clique, and many, many independents. The usurpation of years of Beiyang rule have now rendered them in need of either currying favor with the new establishment or falling into obscurity.\n\nOf these groups, the PSC and the Jingxing Society are the closest to reaffirming the status quo. As a loose association of politicians, many of them already have allies and mutual interests with their southern counterparts and thus they will be a natural fit in the new order. Already, Southern PSC politicians are already staffing the national bureaucracy with former members of the Northern PSC while [ROOT.GetNameLeader] has made overtures to members of the YCP and DCP; promising them lucrative positions and rewards in the new national government. As the Mandate of Heaven now shifts to the South once more in Chinese history, the new regime is eager not to rock the boat too much and to applaud a unification as bloodless as possible."

 GXC.lategame.802.t: "The FCDP Reforms"
 GXC.lategame.802.d: "Despite the gravitation towards reactionary autocracy or revolutionary party dictatorship amongst many Chinese intellectuals following the Xinhai Revolution, there were many who continued to fight for constitutional democracy in China. Many of these figures gathered under the United National Construction League in 1929 after the destruction of the KMT and Zhili Unification.\n\nElections that year resulted in an overwhelming majority for the Zhili backed Harmony Association. While UNCL aligned politicians won many seats, the participation of KMT adjacent intellectuals like Zhang Bojun and Tan Pingshan drew scrutiny to the quasi-legal movement. When socialist and leftist uprisings rattled China in 1932, the Zhili banned the UNCL, forcing them underground. The Federation of Chinese Democratic Parties was thus born, excluding the UNCL's socialist members and continuing to lobby for change.\n\nWith the NPA now in charge of Beijing, the Federation has a chance at reasserting themselves once again. Spearheaded by the Democratic Constitutionalist Party, the Political Science Clique and the Democratic Socialist Party, the loose alliance also draws in smaller groups like the National Salvation Federation, Democracy and Science Forum, the Chinese Vocational Education Society, Rural Reconstruction Association, and the China National Democratic Construction Association. While weak and disorganised, they appeal to many hungry for change."

 GXC.lategame.803.d: "Lu Yuguang has been called many things. A bandit, the son of a foreign whore, an inexperienced general. But he has done what many could not - finally unifying the North and South. The Young Marshal has become the de-facto supreme military leader in all of China. Leading the mighty armed forces of Guangxi and Guangdong, the Young Guangxi Faction were forced to make compromises with regionalist blocs in Shaoguan and Guangzhou but have now solidified their control over the opposition.\n\nAnd with the victors come the spoils, and the knives are once again drawn as a power struggle has arisen between the Liangguang leaders. Lu hopes to use his newfound position to sideline the foreign sell-out Chen Lianbo and the nefarious bandit Shen Hongying, thus bringing Guangdong permanently under his control.\n\nThe Young Guangxi Triumvirate has suggested appointing Lin Hu as Governor of Guangdong - citing his prior experiences working in the Cantonese political scene during the 1920s. He will use Guangxi's military might and his Political Science Clique connections to smash both Shen and Chen's influence in the region, bringing the area firmly under Young Guangxi Control. There are fears however that this might destabilise the region, but Guangdong might be too valuable to lose."

### NPA Contender Followup Events (830-859):
 GXC.lategame.830.t: "Administering the Provinces"
 GXC.lategame.830.d: "For the first time since the National Protection War, the forces of the National Protection Alliance have swept past their home provinces and have advanced into the broad swathes of the Chinese country. As troops march through burning villages and hamlets and past war-torn battlefields; the military forces of the NPA are confronted with the arduuous task of local administration.\n\nThe Baojia System is currently utilised as a means of administering the military government's new rule of their territories. An ancient practice designed during the Northern Song Dynasty by Wang Anshi, the system has changed throughout its history in imperial China but nonetheless envisions small community organisations grouped by \"baos\" which typically govern around ten families.\n\nThe new military government has installed modenrn reforms to the existing system on a three step system. The first step requires that all households in the new and existing regions be surveyed. The second step is that all eligible young men are to be listed. The final step is for all the surveyed young man of appropriate military fitness are to be transported to a training school where they will serve three years in the military and be on the reserve for the next six years. This system hopes to maintain both the physical fitness of the Chinese people while also administering local provinces that may be far from central government control.\n\nWhile this reform is certainly popular among the military governments, some advisors to [ROOT.GetLeader] have instead proposed that local leaders are better suited to administering the baojia. They have instead suggested expanding local bureaucracies to include administrative structures into county magistrates and create new structures to administer smaller villages and towns to be headed by chiefs. An administrative inspectorate system would then be implemented connecting the provincial capital with these local administrative divisions."
 GXC.lategame.830.a: "Military knows best."
 GXC.lategame.830.b: "The people know what's best."

 GXC.lategame.831.t: "Cantonese Opera"
 GXC.lategame.831.d: "As one of the major categories in Chinese opera, Cantonese (Yue) opera is one of the Cantonese language's most prestigious and premier cultural institutions popular within Guangdong, Guangxi, Hong Kong, Macau, and other Chinese communities in South East Asia. There is debate as to when Yue opera began but it is generally accepted that it came from the North and slowly migrated to the southern province of Guangdong during the late Southern Song. As the Mongols and other Northern barbaric tribes dismantled the cultural supremacy of the northern courts, the Song developed and adapted to the new cultural capital of China in Hangzhou.\n\nModern Yue opera comes from Shanghai, as during the 1840s, a large number of Guangdong businessmen came to Shanghai for oppurtunities. As these businessmen coalesced into associations, the development of Cantonese opera in Shanghai developed significantly - finding popularity amongst the city's Chinese elite.\n\nCommentators and fans take pride in the idea that Yue opera differs in its language and unique visual elements. Make up is less exaggerated than in the north and costumes are ornate but reflect southern styles. The singing style of Yue opera is also more lyrical and melodic; with the gaohu, yehu, and percussion dominating the instrumental track as opposed to the northern jinghu and yueqin.\n\nThere are two types of Cantonese plays: Mou (which is themed around war, with characters being generals or warriors) and Man (literally \"highly educated\" and emphasises poetry, culture, and elegance. For instance, female characters wear water sleeves in Man productions, emphasising their elegance and tenderness while also putting significant effort int ocreating distinctive facial expressions and gestures to express their emotions. All these elements contribute to a unique regionalist cultural identity that reinforces Cantonese dominance of Chinese culture in the South as opposed to the North."

Amongst the Chinese, the war has also become one of fratricide as well as some are split on whether or not partnership and union with Japan may prove to be fruitful against European imperialism on the Continent or if they are merely the latest imperialist to join the fray. But for many s across the country, this has also been a moment of national unity as petty differences are put aside, old enemies are now friends, as China's most desperate hour has come.\n\nAs the war rages on, in Guangdong - tensions have spiked between the various factions. Some see Lu Yuguang as being too disloyal to the central government at a time where unity must be paramount and that the Young Guangxi Faction has been exploiting the chaos of the war to secure for themselves a much more desirable position throughout the country. But with Japan's much more advanced position in the conflict owing to their superior air, naval, and land forces - has also led the nationalist war hawks in the government to support the cause of national unity."

The twin provinces of Guangxi and Guangdong (Liangguang referring to the \"two Guangs\") are nominally ruled by Viceroy Lu Yuguang and his Young Guangxi Faction but their power rests on their direct control over Guangxi Province, the militarised \"Sparta\" of the South.\n\nTo remain dominant over the wealthier and more populous Guangdong, Lu and his father Lu Rongting before him kept the province divided between the Shen Army Faction in the north based in Shaoguan and the Guangzhou Merchant Government in the south. Should the province be united under one of those warlords, Guangdong would ultimately dominate Guangxi and control the Pearl River."

 GXC.lategame.911.t: "An Unexpected Twist"
 GXC.lategame.911.d: "In a sudden reversal of fortune, it would appear that the warlords of Liangguang have managed to form a government in their own right. Most would not have expected this to have happened the way it did, but the demise of the old central government gave them an opening and the once peripheral splinter has managed to carve out a role for themselves.\n\nThis development has not come without consequences however. Greater political power comes with greater expectations and the new government is now on the hook for debt repayments, reconstructing devastated areas, and reorganising the now overstretched military. Furthermore, there is considerable jockeying for power. Lu Yuguang and the Young Guangxi junta have attempted to assert their control but their loose hold over Guangdong may be their undoing. Both Shen Hongying in Shaoguan and Chen Lianbo in Guangzhou have attempted to challenge Nanning's leadership, and in the chaos Liangguang seems on the verge of disintegrating."

 GXC.lategame.930.t: "Liu Zhenhuan Seizes Guangxi"
 GXC.lategame.930.d: "After Lu Yuguang's disastrous attempt at forcing Guangdong back into submission, the defeated Marshal faced further humiliation as his defeated units trudged back to Guangxi. Discredited at home by these political developments, on bad terms with the central government, and with Guangxi now facing being forced into subservience by Guangdong, his power evaporated. No longer Viceroy of Liangguang, his attempt at assuming the title of Governor Guangxi was met with resistance from Ma Ji. The other Triumvirs then turned on the two, plunging the province into a prolonged crisis.\n\nIn the end however, it was General Liu Zhenhuan who came out on top. Effectively exiled into Guangdong after he defected during the Second Yue-Gui War, his ambitions of ruling Guangxi never died. Now, backed by Guangdong he and his men were able to emerge on top of the power struggle for the province as the various Guangxi Clans seek a champion against Cantonese dominance.\n\nHis ascension ends the almost year long stand-off between Guangdong and Guangxi, de-escalating tensions between the two. It also mirrors the broader rise of the Political Science Clique in Liangguang, as the savvy and flexible alliance leverage their nation-wide influence and connections within Guangdong for power. Still nominally allies with Chen Lianbo and his Guangzhou Merchant Government, it seems they are rapidly heading on a collision course."
 GXC.lategame.930.a: "They have become a rival!"
 GXC.lategame.930.b: "They bring peace to Guangxi."

 GXC.lategame.931.t: "The Merchant Alternative"
 GXC.lategame.931.d: "Over the past two years, Guangdong has become the site of a fascinating political experiment in China: the site of a province-wide \"Merchant Government\". The Canton Merchant Corps was founded as a sort of \"alternative\" to warlord rule and despite its name its membership was never exclusive to merchants - civilians, small business owners, miners, gentry, craftsmen, and their families could all become members. In addition to its militias, it also had its own publication - the Guangdong Merchants' Gazette.\n\nGoverning-wise, it generally adopted the same legal framework as the existing Guangdong Provincial Government that existed prior to the complete KMT takeover in the 1920s. Even when the Merchants were not in power, the Merchants Corp had a senate that elected its President. There even was a degree of political campaigning - Chen Lianbo is said to have sent subordinates to all 10 constituent branches to rally support for his candidacy. But that is not to say the government is particularly democratic - Chen Lianbo is said to exclusively speak to upper class members of the Corps, relying on the younger and more lively Deng Jieshi to speak to the middle and lower classes as well as peasant representatives.\n\nChen is a controversial figure - described as being very stylish and generous on one hand and aggressive, money-loving, and conniving on the other. His rivals accuse him of treating the Merchant Corps and later the AACSG as merely another money-making venture, only befriending other merchant leaders like Deng Jieshi and Li Songshao (the Chairman of the Guangdong Chamber of Commerce) for their money and influence. But the Governor has much greater ambitions than running a petty protection racket - even back in 1925 he sought to convince Sun Yat-sen to step down and allow for the establishment of a Guangdong Merchant Government. Having at last gotten his wish, rumors abound that he has been exploring the possibility of a broader mass merchant uprising in all of China."
 GXC.lategame.931.a: "Only the Merchants can truly bring China together again."
 GXC.lategame.931.b: "Chen Lianbo seeks to bring good governance to Guangdong."

 GXC.lategame.940.t: "The Rise of Zhu Jiahua"
 GXC.lategame.940.d: "After Shen Hongying's dramatic victory over Guangzhou and Nanning, the celebrations were short-lived. Realising quickly that few would respect a \"Bandit Government\", Marshal Shen moved quickly to shore up his legitimacy by appointing leading educator Zhu Jiahua to effectively head the civilian government. A non-partisan with governing and diplomatic experience and apparently little personal ambition, the choice seemed like a natural fit.\n\nShen may have gotten more than he bargained for. Zhu has proven to be a much more savvy political operator than most expected, easily navigating the political, bureaucratic, and even international realms. His Jingxing Society ties, though limited, carry weight among intellectuals, businessmen, and even military men thanks to years of Sino-German Cooperation and a desire by many conservative Chinese leaders for a Bismarck-style modernisation and unification of China. Zhu has carved out a sizable sphere of influence for himself, the only question is how will he use it."
 GXC.lategame.940.a: "Zhu Jiahua forms a clique of his own under Marshal Shen's nose."
 GXC.lategame.940.b: "Zhu Jiahua uses his abilities to advance the government's interests."

 GXC.lategame.941.t: "Liangguang Hums to Life"
 GXC.lategame.941.d: "The Shen Army Faction has grown tremendously in power ever since their unification of Liangguang under their rule. While opposition endures in both provinces, Shen Hongying's mastery of Guangxi's clans and alliance with German arms suppliers like Hans Klein has given him a powerful, well-equipped army. His control over Guangdong and the lucrative Pearl River trade has supplied him with the money needed to fund said army and distribute favors to his loyalists.\n\nWith so much wealth and power, what more can Marshal Shen ask for? For a man who grew up a poor bandit, it would surprise no one if he decided to be satisfied now at the height of his power. But as the warlord era has shown, ambition begets further ambition and to stay in place is to fall behind. Some wonder if he will ever truly feel satisfied - or even safe - until there is no one left who can take it from him."
 GXC.lategame.941.a: "Shen sets his sights on his next target: the Presidency."
 GXC.lategame.941.b: "Everything we can possibly want can be found in Liangguang."

 GXC.lategame.950.t: "The Marshal and His Men"
 GXC.lategame.950.d: "Lu Yuguang has defeated all of those who would challenge him for power amid the Sino-Japanese War and reinforced his dominance over Liangguang, but his troubles do not end there. Once merely a figurehead for the Young Guangxi triumvirate, his power and influence has grown tremendously over the years as he takes the stage as not just Lu Rongting's son and hastily groomed heir, but a legitimate successor to his father's legacy.\n\nHe is at a point where he can do more than simply broker change between the various regional warlords, commanding the respect needed to actively direct it - at least within the two provinces. Some in his inner circle have advised him to take advantage of the moment to push towards a more conventional, civilian rule under a modern government. But this may not bode so well in the long term for Marshal Lu - after all, once the other warlords are gone, how long will it be before he's next?"
 GXC.lategame.950.a: "Marshal Lu is a leader for the next age."
 GXC.lategame.950.b: "Without lips, the teeth will become cold."

 GXC.lategame.951.t: "The Young Marshal's Ambition"
 GXC.lategame.951.d: "Over a decade ago, Lu Rongting drove out Long Jiguang and became master of both Guangxi and Guangdong, and his mastery over Liangguang allowed him to negotiate with the central government as an equal. Now, Lu Yuguang's victory over both Shaoguan and Guangzhou has brought him national attention, especially from those who are desperately seeking an alternative to the Central Government's often tyrannical rule.\n\nIndeed, uncontested control over Liangguang and the valuable Guangdong trade network as well as being able to command the mighty armies of the Guangxi Clans puts Marshal Lu in a powerful position. Guangzhou sits on a political hotbed prone to rebellions against the status quo and a powerful symbol of legitimacy should the opportunity arise. The Young Marshal may have negotiated a settlement with [GXC.Overlord.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], but he does not have to abide by it..."
 GXC.lategame.951.a: "Our moment to shine is coming soon..."
 GXC.lategame.951.b: "...but as one part of a greater whole."

### NPA Civil War Events (960-989):
 GXC.lategame.960.t: "Civil War Breaks Out"
 GXC.lategame.960.d: "Strife and political chaos in China has resumed. [ROOT.GetLeader] and forces loyal to him in Liangguang have denounced the Central Government and have proclaimed a new movement independent to that of Beijing. Claiming to be the true heirs of the Xinhai Revolution and to represent the legitimate will of the Chinese people, skirmishes have already broken out between the National Government and [ROOT.GetNameDef].\n\n[ROOT.GetLeader]'s rebellion certainly holds the risks of complete failure. Many times in Chinese history, rebels have led ill-fated rebellions that have been brutally repressed and crushed. But this is also hardly the first time that Liangguang has rebelled against central government authority and the spirit of Piedmontism that has guided so many upstart movements will surely follow rebel forces. Fortune favours the bold and in this case, in this moment of national government weakness; Liangguang has taken its own destiny into its hands."
 GXC.lategame.960.a: "We have no choice but to pursue total victory!"

 GXC.lategame.970.t: "Liangguang Reclaims Its leadership"
 GXC.lategame.970.d: "Once more, Guangzhou is the capital of a rival government seeking to unite China under its banner. Negotiation and calls for truces have failed, and having once more broken off from their latest arrangement with a central government, [ROOT.GetLeader] has announced a new National Protection Alliance under his command. He aims to rally the remaining southern warlords to topple the north and liberate the nation under this nebulous, nationalist movement.\n\nGuangzhou of course is no stranger to this type of arrangement, having hosted the original National Protection Government and a revolving door of other revolutionary governments. This legacy has given it a degree of legitimacy, on top of its existing advantages as a base of operations - its location on the Pearl River has proven instrumental in securing aid, armaments, and supporters for the coming storm ahead."
 GXC.lategame.970.a: "May this government prove more fortunate than the previous ones."

 GXC.lategame.971.t: "[GXC.GetLeader] Claims Leadership"
 GXC.lategame.971.d: "Denouncing the tyranny and corruption of the current Chinese political order, [GXC.GetLeader] has declared a new revolution in Guangzhou. This marks the secession of Guangxi and Guangdong from central government control yet again, demonstrating that true unification between North and South remains elusive.\n\n[GXC.GetLeader] has gathered soldiers, intellectuals, and warlords under a new National Protection Alliance, harkening to the coalition that forced Yuan Shikai's abdication. Given the late timing of this development, many wonder if they have missed out on their best chance for victory. Time will tell whether or not their regime will last or whether this is yet another rebellion smothered into the pages of China's turbulent history."
 GXC.lategame.971.a: "They will save the nation!"
 GXC.lategame.971.b: "A vulture trying to be the last one left."

 GXC.endgame.001.t: "The Illusion Shatters"
 GXC.endgame.001.d: "Finally, the hammer has struck the anvil, and Kuomintang have finally fulfilled their revolutionary duty. Throughout the strife, the struggles and the tribulations, warlords and imperialists alike must kowtow to the true unifiers and heros of the Chinese people. However, whilst on paper they reign supreme, the party-state control of the disparate provinces is but nominal at best, unable to truly assert power and influences whilst anarchy continues in the urban centers, and bandits parade the countryside.\n\nThe utter paralysis brought on by recent political events have only contributed to the ineffectiveness of government outside of core territories, with most warlords only inflamed and emboldened further to hamper efforts for our good governance to reach the peoples they lord over. Even within the governmental apparatus itself, dissenting voices have fermented insurbordination between bureaucrat and National Revolutionary Soldier alike, neither ultimately feeling satisfied with the direction of the National Revolution.\n\nFacing challenges from all sides once more, [ROOT.GetLeader]'s triumph is but a short one, as he must work swiftly to subdue all unrest and avoid the fracturing state of both party and nation from collapsing the revolutionary movement."
 GXC.endgame.001.a: "Infighting brought to the forefront..."

 GXC.endgame.002.t: "The Grand Disenchantment"
 GXC.endgame.002.d: "Despite the Kuomintang being first and foremost a revolutionary vanguardist party, the Reorganisation and strong authoritarian measures employed by the Premier, many within the nation continued to hold hopes that the Kuomintang would completely circumvent the period of tutelage, and enact a full transition to liberal democracy once the nation was united. This however, would be doing a disservice to both the memory and ideals of the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen, alongside leading to what many within the party would perceive as a corrupt sham, mimicking the procedures of the Beiyang Republic.\n\nImmensely dissastisfied with the continued maintenance of the authoritarian hand on the nation, the Dangwai, alongside various liberal Western educated intellectuals, students and even scattered members of the Kuomintang itself — namely the more moderate minded members within the Western Hills clique and Reconstruction Faction — have merged together into a cacophony of disillusioned singing, drowning out any attempt from the [ROOT.GetRulingParty] to aid and soothe the people's suffering.\n\nIn order to restore order, revitalised the nation, and rebuild trust in the government from the people once more, the Premier must demonstrate that the period of tutelage is but a process to ensure a thriving democracy can develop in its aftermath."
 GXC.endgame.002.a: "Our people in flux..."

 GXC.endgame.003.t: "A Revolutionary Social Contract"
 GXC.endgame.003.d: "Whilst the people dissent and openly treat the government with suspicion, resentment and caution, the majority continue to treat the regime with ambivalence, disinterest or even support in a few occasions, for there is still a strong belief and hope that lingers in [ROOT.GetLeader]'s steady leadership at the helm. However this series of affairs only continues under an incredibly strict unspoken social contract between the government and the people: they will willingly submit and acquiesce their political, economic and social freedoms if only the Kuomintang can succeed and deliver on the promises of the National Revolution improving their squalid livelihood in some meaningfully clear way.\n\nSuch a stipulation carries a heavy burden upon the government, for they must heed the people's demands and keep the swift pace with the exceedingly ambitious proposals presented by the National Reconstruction Plan if they want to maintain both the system upon which they have instated, and a benevolent outlook from the people. Regardless, the revolutionary party must start from rock bottom, for they have inherited the mantle of a broken economic system, fleeing investors and currency, devastated cities and infrastructure adjoining severe debts that run the risk of further crashing the economy with hyperinflation."
 GXC.endgame.003.a: "A long road ahead of us..."

 GXC.endgame.004.t: "Fate of the Counter-Revolutionaries"
 GXC.endgame.004.d.1: "The National Revolutionary Army is but a leviathan now compared to as it was not even years ago. From the boisterous revolutionary heroes descending upon Beijing for the betterment of the nation, to scattered bands of fearful insurgents operating guerilla campaigns in Guizhou and Fujian with stroves of exiles abroad in Paris and Moscow, to reclaiming the mantle of the best the Chinese soldier can offer, the true pride of the nation, the NRA has seen it all and endured even further. Despite the great valour won and strides made however, there still remains plans for demobilisation of certain army groups now that peace has dawned upon the Chinese nation once more.\n\nPressing matters have appeared on Hu Hanmin's desk however, as following his successful maintenance of influence as the true heir to Dr. Sun, the National Revolutionary Army has fractured due to the removal of key generals aligned with the New Guangxi Clique. Truly an expert at managing levers and pulleys, the Premier could take the initiative and dangle the prospective carrot from a stick, extending an olive branch to the less committed members aligned with New Guangxi and allowing them to return to their previous positions within the NRA, with even Chen Mingshu's clique resurfacing at the prospect of being able to re-enter service oncemore. Although the premier can also finally put the foot down, promoting a new generation of subservient officers utterly devoted to the National Revolution first and foremost, doing away with Li Zongren's perfidious cadres once and for all." #Hu Hanmin
 GXC.endgame.004.d.2: "The National Revolutionary Army is but a leviathan now compared to as as it was not even years ago. From the boisterous revolutionary heroes descending upon Beijing for the betterment of the nation, to scattered bands of fearful insurgents operating guerilla campaigns in Guizhou and Fujian with stroves of exiles abroad in Paris and Moscow, to reclaiming the mantle of the best the Chinese soldier can offer, the true pride of the nation, the NRA has seen it all and endured even further. Despite the great valour won and strides made however, there still remains plans for demobilisation of certain army groups now that peace has dawned upon the Chinese nation once more.\n\nMore pressing matters have dawned for Li however, as following his gambit to claim the throne of the Kuomintang, the National Revolutionary Army has fractured due to the removal of key generals aligned with the weak minded cliques of Western Hills, Reconstruction and Hu Hanmin's Elder's. Despite the animosity, Li is a military man through and through, respecting the mutual struggles endured and bonds built during his service with his peers in the National Revolutionary Army, perhaps extending a hand to those willing to forego political squabbles in place of their true comradery and duty to the nation. Albeit, this is also an ample opportunity for the New Guangxi Clique to finally truly reign supreme, for the clique can merely promote Guangxi officers aligned to their interests, as a reward for being the saviours of the nation." #Li Zongren
 GXC.endgame.004.a: "Their tactical minds are still of use."
 GXC.endgame.004.b: "Our bonds were forged in blood."
 GXC.endgame.004.c: "Promote a new generation of leadership."

 GXC.endgame.005.t: "The Shattered Remnant"
 GXC.endgame.005.d.1: "In the political aftermath of Li Zongren's attempts to siege and overthrow the Premier, political and bureaucratic chaos has struck our officials, with many that had connections to Li and his cadres being removed from their positions or arrested, alongside dissident Western Hills Clique and Reconstruction Faction members, with even leftist figures who openly opposed the government's handling of events being caught in the crossfire.\n\nHowever certain remaining members within the party fear that the approach taken was particularly heavy handed, even in light of nearly being ousted, and have suggested to the [ROOT.GetLeader] that extending an invitation to certain useful rivals from the other cliques — such as New Guangxi and the leftists — could be more beneficial to the government rather than a detriment. Whilst stubborn and resilient, the Premier could weigh the value of these men's skillsets as being superior to any lingering political differences, although the option always remains to cast away any hopes of bestowing mercy upon men who would've supported the failure of the National Revolution. For do the Chinese people need more meddling bureaucrats?" #Hu Hanmin
 GXC.endgame.005.d.2: "In the great triumph of the New Guangxi Clique toppling all adversaries to their influence, and sitting upon the throne of the National Revolution, it was evident that the government would no longer function as efficiently as it had once before. Many skilled figures were either arrested and removed, or resigned in protest of Li Zongren's premiership, causing incredible strain on all organs of the bureaucracy as it struggles to even attend to daily functions.\n\nDespite the crescendo and noise generated from Hu Hanmin's fall, there have been murmurs that certain figures once aligned to him would be willing to return to their positions within the government if given amnesty from the leadership of New Guangxi. Ignoring political differences, it presents an enticing offer to Li, as individuals within the Western Hills Clique, Reconstruction Faction and even the New Guangdong Clique yield invaluable skills that are sorely needed in these dires times. Nonetheless, this is also an opportunity to further cement and ensure the dominance of the New Guangxi Clique above all else, for they have weathered far worse challenges before." #Li Zongren
 GXC.endgame.005.a: "In the name of cross party unity."
 GXC.endgame.005.b: "An olive branch to the democrats."
 GXC.endgame.005.c: "Consolidate power for ourselves."

 GXC.endgame.006.t: "The Chinese Piedmont"
 GXC.endgame.006.d.1: "Being the roaring forge in which the revolutionary movement was born, Guangdong has always seen itself as the most premier province in the republican movement. Boasting an impressive economy to further reinforce its lofty ambitions, the province has drawn comparisons amongst international spectators to that of Sardinia-Piedmont during the wars of Italian unification, being the primer driver of reunification for the Chinese nation and its people.\n\nDescending from the province, Hu Hanmin, takes great pride in the exceptional status of Guangdong, however, an ironic dilemma presents itself: the Premier despises challengers to his rule, and naturally is hesistant to entertain treacherous ideas such as autonomy for other provinces, yet blatant displays of favouritism for Guangdong are not uncommon, with the province receiving hefty benefits. This treatment has even gone as far as to extend to governmental appointments, with most positions filled by Guangdong natives.\n\nAs they say, to the victor go the spoils, and none would disagree that Guangdong has earned its special treatment, however some voices within the government are advocating that the Premier lessen the blatant prioritising of his home province, and others have even suggested the idea of extending the current privileges to the other provinces under the Kuomintang's auspices." #HU Hanmin
 GXC.endgame.006.d.2: "Having contributed swathes of excellent soldiers to the revolutionary cause, Guangxi has always seen itself as a truly exceptional and critical province in the Kuomintang's revolutionary movement. Being the first province to turn to the Kuomintang on the eve of the Northern Expedition, the militarist nature of Guangxi's people has proved vital in the victories of the National Revolutionary Army.\n\nA fierce defender of the province's autonomy, culture and lifestyle, Li Zongren takes great pride in the exceptional status of Guangxi, however, an ironic dilemma has presented itself: the New Guangxi Clique fiercely opposes any challenges to its stern rule, and adamantly refuses at extending autonomy to the other provinces, yet their home province of Guangxi receives notorious favouritism, privileges, and Guangxi natives receiving priority for governmental positions.\n\nAlthough as they say, to the victor goes the spoils, and none within our government would dare doubt that Guangxi has earned its privileges in blood. However, there remains murmurs that Li Zongren could dial down the blatant displays of favouritism, or even extend such treatment to the other provinces, to soothe any future tensions with the other provinces." #LI Zongren
 GXC.endgame.006.a: "The Model Province has earned its privileges."
 GXC.endgame.006.b: "We should cut back on the favouritism."
 GXC.endgame.006.c: "All provinces deserve some self rule."

 GXC.endgame.007.t: "An Exceptional Man in Extraordinary Times"
 GXC.endgame.007.d: "If there was ever a man to earn the honour of the true successor to Dr. Sun Yat-sen, no one would dare suggest anyone else than the esteemed Premier, Hu Hanmin. A true orthodox scholar in the Three Principles, he has weathered innumerable challenges leading the glorious National Revolution, and is steadfast on seeing the phases set out by his predecessors are followed in strict procedure.\n\nA truly exceptional figure on the international political scene, Hu Hanmin has truly inscribed a permanent mark on the annals of history as one of finest and foremost statesman to have ever descended upon the world stage. A grand mixture of extremely intelligent, studious and hard working, principled, stubborn, yet maintaining resounding popular support with the populace. Able to extend a hand across the aisle, targeting multiple meddling factions at once, truly serving as the glue holding the government together. All of these achievements have contributed to the growth and development of an extensive growing cult of personality amongst the populace, praising the efforts of the Premier as the second Sun Yat-sen.\n\nFurthermore, Hu Hanmin has vowed to champion the interests of both people and country, following the stricly laid out six year plan, of which the critical components are much needed land reform, local infrastructure efforts for local self government, and education reform for the whole populace. Deftly wielding his grand coalition, Hu Hanmin has been granted the grand opportunity to focus on one of these components to start."
 GXC.endgame.007.a: "The peasants have long awaited their saviour."
 GXC.endgame.007.b: "We must plant the seeds of democracy at the grassroots."
 GXC.endgame.007.c: "How could we teach the people without schools?"

 ##EDC Events (020-039)

 GXC.endgame.020.t: "Hu Hanmin and the Dawn of a New Era"
 GXC.endgame.020.d: "Amidst the chaos of the recent struggles within China, Hu Hanmin shines ever brightly as a beacon of hope, championing an orthodox interpretation of the Guofu's Three Principles of the People, for long he has envisioned overseeing a future for the Chinese people free of the strife brought on by the Warlord Era. However, Hu's unwavering commitment to the Three Principles sets him apart from his less principled peers within the Kuomintang — namely Wang Jingwei and the late Chiang Kai-shek — as he adamantly opposes any deals with external forces outside the party, relying mostly on his capable political manoeuvring and inter-party alliances.\n\nKeen on seeing the Three Principles enacted at every individual stage of the revolution, the Premier has reinforced the phases of military rule, with tutelage to follow soon after, as without this strict procedure the brave revolutionary soldiers of the National Revolutionary Army could merely supplant the warlords of old. Believing that the party before his stewardship was neglecting the people's interests by not implementing the stage of tutelage completely, the Premier intends to follow Dr. Sun's National Reconstruction Plan by the letter to craft the Chinese nation that Dr. Sun envisioned.\n\nIn the shift from Tutelage to Constitutionalism, Hu Hanmin maintains the concept that a province is ready for democracy once all of its counties had achieved local self-government as dictated by local and national efforts. Once more than half of the number of provinces within the country have reached the Constitutional Stage, a national convention will be assembled to deliberate and promulgative a new national constitution, ensuring a thoroughly healthy democratic foundation for the nation."
 GXC.endgame.020.a: "A golden road lies before us."

 GXC.endgame.021.t: "The Revolution and the Land"
 GXC.endgame.021.d: "Having been an ever present issue since the malignant Great Qing, the land reform question has always burned ever present in the intellectual minds of not just the Kuomintang, but all political movements in the nation as a whole. With his mind deeply rooted in his simultaneous socialist background and commitment to the welfare of the people, Hu Hanmin has put forth his radical land reform plan to be debated on by the Central Executive Committee.\n\nCentral to this plan is the concept that the lowly tenant farmers of China should be protected from their common abuse and exploitation by landlords, stipulating that in the case of drought, flood or other similar natural disasters, their rent would be reduced accordingly or even exempted completely. Pushing onwards, the Premier's plan proposes that landlords be restrained from evicting their tenants except for the purpose of self-tilling. Insofar to this end, the Peasantry are to be aided by \"the power of the state\", and on no account are they to be \"thrown into disorder\".\n\nBeginning with a land-survey to initialise his aforementioned equalisation of land rights policy, the state would begin to set up agricultural banks to allow low-interest loans to become available to the peasants. The state would then establish cooperatives to facilitate the sale of produce, and so help the peasants avoid the manipulation of the market by exploitative merchants, and increase production in the long term.\n\nHowever, Hu's radical, extensive and perhaps heartless approach in the eyes of the gentry has received considerable blowback from conservative members of the Party. Whilst they perpetuate entrenched inequalities due to their control over the land, the Gentry have nonetheless been some of the Kuomintang's most staunch supporters. Instead members of the Western Hills Clique and Reconstruction Faction have posited a more gradual reduction in gentry and landlord power. Pulling on the thread of Hu's desire to prevent disorder in the countryside."
 GXC.endgame.021.a: "The compromise agreement sways the Premier."
 GXC.endgame.021.b: "Onwards with abolition of the landlord!"

 GXC.endgame.022.t: "Chinese Philosophy and the Materialist Lens"
 GXC.endgame.022.d: "Ever a brilliant and prolific writer, the esteemed Premier's literary works could fill a library with the bountiful writings of China's greatest political philosopher. For the careful investigator, one piece of particular note is Hu Hanmin's \"A Study of History of Chinese Philosophy from Materialistic Perspective\" written in 1919, which has been passed around intellectual and party circles alike as an interesting insight into the mind of their national leader.\n\nTheorising that the circumstances wherein a school of thought arose demonstrated an intrinsic relationship between socio-economic conditions and the rise of schools of thought in a society, Hu begins within the Warring States era, noting that the large magnitude of chaos. As a result, the chaos stimulated intellectuals to philosophise and speculate about solutions. When safety and stability returned in the Qin and Han dynasties, the society remained largely peaceful, resulting in the atrophy of intellectual thought.\n\nRetroactively applying his theory to later schools of thought within the Han, Song and Tang dynasties, Hu postulated that Taoism, Confucianism and Buddhism all arose in times of great societal stress, with the religions losing relevance once they failed to provide solutions to moral upheavals.\n\nHe opined that China experienced socio-economic dislocation not too dissimilar to that of the Warring States period, and with his devout belief in the importance of societal and economic factors in fostering intellectualism, he placed high hopes for a second flourishing of schools of Chinese philosophies during his own lifetime.\n\nAn interesting illumination into the mind of a budding revolutionary with a magnificent future, the piece is not without criticism. Numerous times does the Premier proceed on tangential monologues about history, and he would frequently veer away from the historical materialist mindset, creating a discourse on Chinese philosophy thinly veiled with historical materialism."
 GXC.endgame.022.a: "A magnificent mind at the wheel."
 GXC.endgame.022.b: "A great thinker maybe, but a poor writer."

 #Adapted from 五四運動紀念會演講詞 - Speech at the Nov 4th Movement Commemoration.
 GXC.endgame.023.t: "From May to November"
 GXC.endgame.023.d: "In October 1919, leaked documents exposed the Beiyang government's secret deals trading Shandong for predatory Entente loans. This triggered unrest on November 4th, which along with the 1925 May 30th protests became emblematic of the Chinese people's unwavering struggle against imperialism.\n\nHu Hanmin commemorated both today as patriotic movements that contained the \"spirit of national independence that drives out foreign oppression across all time\". This spirit allowed the Ming to expel the Mongols, the Xinhai rebels to expel the Manchus, and the wrath of the students to save Chinese independence. It is that same spirit that Sun Yat-sen inscribed as his first Principle: Minzu (Nationalism).\n\nDr. Sun said, \"national revolution is an effective remedy to save the era\", which will continue \"until the day and moment without oppression between nations\". However, while the protests were of national revolutionary character, they \"were haphazard and disorganised, with temporary acts but not fundamental advocacy.\" Sun understood that a fundamental revolution must be based on \"national character\", something impossible to erase.\n\nMarx did not understand this, and the Second Internationale failed because \"despite belonging to the same class, they belonged to different nations, and oppression between each other had yet to be resolved, thus they still struggled with each other.\" Hu extolled the youth not to believe that it is \"hackneyed to discuss national revolution and innovative to talk about class revolution,\" because the latter is unnatural and unnecessary.\n\nHe warns of the Internationale's Red Imperialism, which seeks to sacrifice millions of Chinese to achieve its unthinkable aims. Therefore Hu concludes, \"why must the Chinese youth care nothing about sacrificing their country, nation, and revolutionary cause to flatter the others?...If we do not develop the spirit of national independence, how can we achieve anything? Naturally then, we must complete the national revolution under the guidance of the Three Principles!\""

 GXC.endgame.024.t: "The Army of the National Revolution"
 GXC.endgame.024.d: "Having been a strongly resolute civilian leader for the entirety of his career, the position of the National Revolutionary Army in relation to Premier Hu Hanmin has always been a tenuous one. Without the National Revolutionary Army's successes in the Second Northern Expedition, the revolution might as well have been stamped out for a second time in the century, yet perhaps the greatest threat to the revolutionary movement as it stands currently is now the cudgel with which it yields.\n\nAlways the capable national leader, the Premier has rallied for the recognition of the great significance of restoring Party authority and unifying cohesion amongst the NRA not only in the military campaigns of the recent years, but of the current work in the National Revolution and even in the heavy responsibilities dawning on the new Nationalist government. If the National Revolution is to succeed, there must be a tough revolutionary army and a faithful and valiant Commander-in-Chief. To enable the revolutionary army to break through enemy lines, there must be a strong party as well.\n\nIn a speech preached during a military parade in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], the Premier left his audience of willing listeners with this statement: \"Armed comrades, you shall all believe that you are revolutionary. You all should enhance your revolutionary character and be an irresistible mighty great force. With such force, your revolutionary leadership can be strengthened. The National Revolution requires a mighty great force. For the sake of the National Revolution, we must, together with the revolutionary public from various provinces, form a united spirit and force. In a bid to do so, we must uphold the revolutionary leader and consolidate the revolutionary front!\""
 GXC.endgame.024.a: "The NRA and the revolutionary people, unite!"

 GXC.endgame.025.t: "Labour Day and the Chinese Revolution"
 GXC.endgame.025.d: "To Hu Hanmin and his Elders Clique, the meaning of Labour Day is that of great commemoration, for it is when the workers and labourers of the United States fought valiantly in an effort to establish the system of an Eight-hour work day. Notably in the Chairman's eyes is the fact that such a celebration has never taken place in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], due to the fact that in the past, the city was held under the iron grip of warlords, hence no commemoration could be held.\n\nHowever, the very fact that it can be held today, is that not due to the protection of the National Revolutionary Army? Protection from the NRA means protection from the Kuomintang, with which every citizen should come to learn that the KMT protects its workers and strives for their welfare alongside their freedom.\n\nIn a broader scope, the Premier has put forth the idea that the National Revolution is the united front of all nationals, and in this united front, the workers shall be the vanguards, refraining from playing havoc with each other lest a specific class be promoted leading to the oppression of other classes. From now on, the workers can shake hands with the KMT in a friendly manner, coming together as true friends, cooperating mutually for genuine liberation.\n\nHu Hanmin's concept of the party cooperating directly with the workers serves as a foil to the stance of the Western Hills Clique, who posit that workers should avoid labour disputes in their entirety, and that the true meaning of Labour Day is to exemplify the cooperation between capitalists and workers in the common cause of furthering productivity, not revolutionary liberation.\n\nWith the party's official stance divided between the two outlooks, a debate has silently flared as to whether the Premier's radical stance on worker cooperation that borders on socialist thought is more preferable compared to the stability provided by the WHC's thorough and stable approach."
 GXC.endgame.025.a: "The KMT is the true worker's party!"
 GXC.endgame.025.b: "Coalesce both the capitalist and the worker in perfect harmony."

 GXC.endgame.026.t: "Democratic Centralism and Consensus"
 GXC.endgame.026.d: "Adamant in the following of the Sanminism and the Three Principles in an orthodox manner, Hu Hanmin has refused all attempts from the more democratically minded elements of the Kuomintang to push for a provisional constitution at this time. However he is not a man of pure uncompromising stubbornness, and has accepted proposals of a new organic law in which a prototypic version of the planned five yuan government would be implemented. Therefore, the government has begun the formal creation of the various governmental yuans, with which has come the discussion of the accompanying political appointments.\n\nWith Hu Hanmin and his allies dominating the Executive Yuan, Sun Fo and the Reconstruction Faction have been granted free reign over the Legislative Yuan, whilst Ju Zheng and the Western Hills Clique were given the Judicial yuan, with the Control and Examination yuan being split between various northerners alongside other smaller cliques.\n\nWith the various factions clawing at their bountiful harvests, all that remains is for Hu Hanmin to appoint a Premier of the Executive Yuan, akin to a Western styled Prime Minister. Whilst none would blame him for appointing a loyal follower such as his protégé Li Wenfan, Hu Hanmin could extend a hand \"across the aisle\" to reassure people of his good intentions.\n\nOf the two options present for external choices, the first option is close friend and deputy of Sun Fo, Liang Hancao. A keen legislator and intellectual, he has been an excellent second-in-command figure within the RCF, reflecting the young, new revolutionary movement of the future. Our second option is to instead extend the invitation to the enigmatic and magnanimous Zou Lu, a well known quantity to most within both the Elders Clique and WHC. A man of many talents, Zou Lu has connections to the majority within the Kuomintang, and has been a veteran member of the party since its founding, having even developed a great personal friendship with the Premier for their mutual adoration of writing."
 GXC.endgame.026.a: "Li Wenfan is the natural choice."
 GXC.endgame.026.b: "Liang Hancao is a fresh face."
 GXC.endgame.026.c: "Zou Lu has valuable experience."

 GXC.endgame.027.t: "Remembering the Double Fifth"
 GXC.endgame.027.d: "On May 5th, President Hu delivered a speech honouring his distant but ever relevant predecessor. In 1923, Sun Yat-sen claimed the title of President of the Republic, in a moment Hu claims is as significant as Double Ten day. Hu Hanmin recounts the preceding events, including his first inauguration on New Year's day 1912 in Nanjing. In Hu's recounting, Sun resigned shortly afterwards because with China unified, Sun felt his work completed and as an \"exemplary public servant of the Republic\" sought no further power. He instead sought to continue to train his party members in the Three Principles and reconsolidate the foundation of the revolution.\n\nBut it was not long before the Republic unravelled, brought down by conniving Generals. Therefore, after expelling the Guangxi warlords he made the grand plan of the Northern Expedition. He retook the position of President of the Republic, then confined to Liangguang, not out of entitlement but because of a tremendous sense of responsibility for the national revolution as a leader, mentor, and sacrificer. \"Thus,\" Hu asks, \"how could our hearts not be touched?\"\n\nHu continued his speech with a personal touch, fondly describing Sun's humility and open mind, but notes that when it came to national affairs he held the spirit of \"if I do not do it, who else would?\" With this tenacious spirit, the Kuomintang must carry on its tutelage. It must belong to the people and carry its will, but also lead the people and show them the way in the great mission to save the country because \"if the Kuomintang does not do it, who else would?\" Thus, the party must press on with the indomitable spirit of \"if I do not do it, who else will?\", reassured that military administration is only a beginning, the political tutelage only a transition, and constitutional rule the destination. Though he closed with reminders of the Eternal Premier's will for the Three Principles and a World Revolution superior to Marx, the true meaning of the parable is clear:"

 GXC.endgame.028.t: "Remembering the Eternal Premier"
 GXC.endgame.028.d: "At a memorial of Sun Yat-sen's passing, Hu Hanmin delivered a speech. Though beginning with a discussion of global politics and concessions in China, he soon segued into more pressing matters that describe the future he envisions for the party-state.\n\nDiscussing unification, Hu remarked that \"our military efforts should now adopt a dual policy: we shall eliminate disrupting syndicalist elements and warlord remnants in China once and for all.\" Still, he cautions that a true victory is impossible without fundamental solutions to its pressing economic and social challenges. To this end, he states, \"our revolutionary army must construct while destructing, unlike the socialists, who only construct after full destruction, and we must especially avoid waiting until the entire nation is destroyed to begin rebuilding. When we conclude destruction at one place, reconstruction works there must begin immediately. Only by doing so can there be a genuine revolution.\"\n\nFurthering the comparison of the party to an army, he remarks that both must be cautious in operation, coherent in organisation, and be intense in training. Similarly, like how armies readily emulate the superior weapons of their enemies, the party must be willing to embrace tactics of other revolutionaries. Others may abuse their strict organisation and fickle methods to disrupt society, but if the Kuomintang adopts similar discipline towards reconstruction, the nation will be saved. A parallel can be found in modern science, which is used by imperialists for murder and by humanists to save lives, because though the science is the same and has no innate guilt attached to it, to abuse it makes one the enemy of humanity.\n\nThus, the party must be willing to adopt discipline, inspired by the brave soldiers who gain strength through their obedience to their generals. \"As for us,\" he concludes, \"we are to govern the country by the Party, not by the individual. We demand freedom for the Party, not the individual. So we must obey our party and observe the Premier's last wishes!\""

 GXC.endgame.029.t: "End of the Six Years of Necessary Tutelage?"
 GXC.endgame.029.d: "It had been a long and arduous road for the Kuomintang's National Revolution. One wrought with roadblocks, winding passageways, and sudden verges both left and right. Most appropriately it was not an easy path to tread. Dr. Sun knew this of course, for to transform a nation of over 400 million people into that of a modern one is perhaps a most insurmountable task. The Kuomintang is a revolutionary party, one built on organisation and doctrine, one that has been steadfastly stewarded by China's most magnificent and enigmatic statesman.\n\nSix years was the timetable to follow. It was six years that the Tutelage phase was to be enacted, as ordained by Dr. Sun. And it had been six years of perennial guidance and struggle for the modernisation and progress of the Chinese nation. Of course, the natural tendencies of rulership began to set in early on. Members of the party began to see the party as nothing more than a means of dominating the people, of abusing the principle of party leadership to exploit the masses for their own gain, to safeguard their assets. However such sentiment has rather subsided, has rather been beaten back tremendously by China's Man of Principle.\n\nFor the all the faults of complacency that would beset any incumbent party that heralds a revolutionary movement, it has not yet managed to clutch the grasps of Hu Hanmin's Party. And yet time of idle pondering remains scarce and fleeting for the Chairman, for even as steadfast and diligent as he is, not even Hu Hanmin could overcome the towering shadow of the Six Year Tutelage. For such great strides of progress have been undoubtedly made under the auspices of Hu Hanmin, but there will be a time wherein the Revolutionary is no more. And what then? Who would continue the wishes of the Eternal Premier? A successor was no easy selection, Hu Hanmin understood that all too well. Yet it is a most pertinent question to be answered, one that Hu himself must be prepared for."

 ##NGD Events (040-059)

 GXC.endgame.040.t: "Guangdong Countercurrent"
 GXC.endgame.040.d: "Premier Hu Hanmin has recently spoken to much appraisal in the most recent Kuomintang National Congress; the very first congress after the Guangdong coalition consolidated dominance and the downfall of the so-called \"pseudo-revolutionary enemies\". Notably far more vicious than Hu's speeches of the contemporary past, the Premier denounced all concepts of enemies to the party, all allusions of incessant militarism and cronyism, and assured the gathered audience that the National Revolution, the Guofu's National Revolution, is back on the right track.\n\nWith the aid of General Chen Jitang and the Guangdong coalition, Hu Hanmin vanquished the obstacles that hindered his revolutionary cause and the realising of the principles of the late Premier, mostly noticeably the reactionary clique of Li Zongren. Utilising his connection and resources in his Kingdom, the Heavenly King of the South has ensured that no officials would openly question his or Hu Hanmin's leadership; with his army, all potential armed threats were neutralised before even a shot was fired. This has allowed Hu to continue his cause without worries against the odds, and General Chen entrenched his place in both his home province and on the national stage. Some have even begun to describe this as the birth of a Guangdong diarchy.\n\nAs the Premier's speech concluded in a thundering round of applause with all participants on their feet and clapping, he waved his hands to all his comrades in the hall, assuring them of his determination to realise the principles of Dr. Sun, with a confident expression and the light in his eyes. Turning to Chen Jitang, Hu nodded lightly to his biggest ally; in return, keeping his head up and back straight, General Chen stood solemnly and saluted to the Commander-in-Chief of the National Revolution and the NRA. Although it is rumoured that the two great men from Guangdong have divergences over various affairs, now they are surely united as one."
 GXC.endgame.040.a: "The National Revolution returns to the right track."

 GXC.endgame.041.t: "The Continuing Cooperative Movement"
 GXC.endgame.041.d: "As Chairman Hu, the successor of Dr. Sun's ideals, stresses, it is equally crucial to realise the Minsheng doctrine as the other two doctrines as \"they are intertwined and address the needs of China\". To achieve so, the Nationalist Government has encouraged rural cooperative societies, where the peasants, who are, in most cases, in debt or simply impoverished, are able to receive government credits to improve their lives, purchase production goods and increase their production after paying 2 yuan for a share to join.\n\nHu Hanmin, citing his experiences in Russia, reckons that if the government is to genuinely improve the livelihood of the people and thus achieve the Minsheng doctrine, such cooperatives should be expanded and more resources allocated. To him, the only right direction is to expand this programme and include the whole peasant population at once so that the Chinese people can enjoy a better material life and stimulate the development of the economy by boosting demand and supply.\n\nChen Jitang, with a more practical mindset, is less progressive on the issue. Although he is also a supporter of the cooperatives and recognises the good that it has brought, Chen suggests that before stepping up any efforts, the Nationalist Government shall first resolve the issue of sky-high government expenditure before planning to increase it. As a military man and the Heavenly King of the South, he holds the view that when it comes to developments \"the entirety must be maintained and each aspect should adapt with each other and advance simultaneously.\" In short, Chen believes that a balanced approach should be adopted so that the well-being of China and the Chinese people can be ensured.\n\nBoth men have thoroughly failed to convince each other, with Gu Yingfen consistently parleying between the individuals, and thus the issue is left to be voted on. As the last declarations are made within the Central Executive Committee, the majority of party members agree that:"
 GXC.endgame.041.a: "Chen Jitang is sound, we shall advance gradually and entrench ourself at every step."
 GXC.endgame.041.b: "Hu Hanmin's advocations would be solid a step to achieve the Minsheng Doctrine."

 GXC.endgame.042.t: "Chen Jitang and the New Life Movement"
 GXC.endgame.042.d: "It has been some time since China was liberated from the warlords and recovered by the National Revolutionary Army, and the Nationalist administration has been on the course of reconstructing and developing the nation in all aspects. Be it cultural, social and educational, no area is bereft of reforms. To reshape Chinese society and entrench the Kuomintang's Three Principles, a grand initiative colloquially known as the \"New Life Movement\" has been launched in full swing.\n\nGovernor Chen Jitang, who regards reconstructing China's inherent cultural moralities and its traditional unifying social atmosphere as the key to establishing a new China, has also pushed forward a series of social reforms in his kingdom to support the social agenda of the Nationalist Government. Governor Chen's programs include the forbidding of \"outrageous clothes\" and the restriction of \"how people dress\", even being as strict as to how long clothes should be according to the law.\n\nChen has also taken this opportunity to consolidate his image within the hearts of the people by promoting what amounts to a personality cult within his Kingdom. He has requested schools to emphasise the teaching of traditional Chinese classics and the adoption of the habit of worshipping Confucius, with an obvious aim to inject the core idea of being loyal subjects into his people's minds. Recently, a new official textbook for secondary and primary schools in Guangdong was published and it seems to have aroused much attention concerning Governor Chen's cult.\n\nRegarding this, Chairman Hu managed to get a copy of the textbook, with the package from Guangdong having just recently arrived at his residence in the capital. Opening the box gently with great curiosity, rarely would Hu ever show great interest in reading publications apart from Dai Jitao's own works. Placing the textbook on his desk, the Chairman sat elegantly on his humble wooden chair whilst perusing the first line of the book, and read to himself:..."
 GXC.endgame.042.a: "\"Governor Chen loves me, and... I love Governor Chen?\""
 GXC.endgame.042.b: "\"These textbooks... replace them with the one approved by the Ministry of Education!\""

 GXC.endgame.043.t: "Honing Our Revolutionary Strength" #磨練我們的革命力量
 GXC.endgame.043.d: "Noting that the National Revolution is reportedly progressing better than ever before, Hu began: \"Now, we have pacified the nation, but the actual revolutionary work has just begun. On this occasion, our comrades shall carry with them the lessons learnt from the past and prevent previous shortcomings from reappearing to hinder our progress. It is imperative that the membership place ourselves under the command of the Party, that we dissuade factionalism, that we serve the masses, and that we make sacrifices for the Party.\"\n\n\"The discipline of our Party should be as strict as that of the army. Discipline in the army prevents soldiers from being scatterbrained because being so means being unable to fight. The Party must follow the same principle. If the members do not observe discipline and are scatterbrained, then the Party will face discord and lose unity.\" Sweeping his gaze quickly around the room to ensure that all are actively listening rather than simply hearing, he continued: \"We must abide by discipline, hold the spirit of sacrifice dear to our hearts so that we can strengthen our party organisation, enhance our relationship with the Party, and improve our understanding of the Party.\"\n\nConcluding his speech with a firm and clear voice, Hu rallied the Kuomintang's Revolutionary fervour and zeal. \"If we are willing to make sacrifices, we will be able to generate the undeniable strength of party individuals. If we can observe discipline, we can unite all the members of the Party and grant a full display of the Party's strength! We must embody the spirit of sacrifice and discipline to train ourselves for the revolution, and we must hone our revolutionary strength to protect the Party!\" As expected, a round of thundering applause erupted immediately after his conclusion. Most members applauded sincerely, whilst some clapped perfunctorily."

 GXC.endgame.044.t: "The Decline of the Yue Coalition"
 GXC.endgame.044.d: "The progress of the National Revolution that occurs today should undoubtedly be attributed to the countless revolutionary veterans who devoted themselves to the Guofu's Three Principles. To further the revolutionary cause, numerous organisations and coalitions were formed in the past decades. Among them, the most influential one would certainly be the Yue Coalition (Guangdong Coalition), a coalition regarded as the pillar of strength of the present day National Revolution.\n\nGuangdong has long since been a revolutionary base since the late Qing dynasty, with Dr. Sun having based his headquarters there for years after the Xinhai Revolution. Without the aid of Guangdong's comrades, the Kuomintang's cause would surely not have gained as much progress as it has now. However, as an old Chinese saying goes, \"all good things must come to an end.\" Whilst Cantonese brotherhood can carry men far, cracks have appeared in the once powerful Yue Coalition, with Chen Jitang supplanting others as the primary military man of the Party.\n\nChen and his army have thrust themselves into various aspects of Chinese society including business, social networks, and the civilian administration, as if it were their daily duties, causing intense backlash. To remove opposition from his old comrades and consolidate his kingdom, Chen and his army have endeavoured to arrest and eject the old Yue officials for being \"reactionary\", including Lin Yungai.\n\nHearing this news after the fact, Chairman Hu, who naturally has diverted much of his attention outside his home province of Guangdong, dialled Governor Chen immediately in his residence, in a rather perturbed manner. In the heated conversation, Chairman Hu engaged in the true and proper dialectics and nuances of Sanminzhuyi, before insisting upon the separation of Civilian and Military affairs as ordained within the Tutelage phase. Evidently, the call is doomed to be in vain. Before hanging up, Hu's last statement was..."
 GXC.endgame.044.a: "\"Fine, they will be temporarily suspended from their duties pending further investigation.\""
 GXC.endgame.044.b: "\"Now that I reflect, aren't personnel changes vested within the authority of the Presidency? Watch yourself, Governor Chen.\""

 GXC.endgame.045.t: "The Plot Against Chen Jitang"
 GXC.endgame.045.d: "Headlines race across the nation today as they have been flooded with reports of the assassination of Zhu Zhuowen, found in his residence alone, lying emotionlessly for perhaps days. The death of an official would not have aroused so much attention, if it were not for the fact that Zhu was allegedly involved in a scheme against Governor Chen Jitang with Hu Hanmin's cousin, Hu Yisheng.\n\nHu Yisheng's career faced a great halt as he was implicated in first a political scandal, and later the assassination attempt on Liao Zhongkai. Drifting into obscurity and fleeing into exile, Hu Yisheng would continue to lie low, until recently. Despite his return, he remains bitter, regarding Chen Jitang as the main obstacle to his current woes.\n\nTo seek a better future career, Hu Yisheng joined Zhu Zhouwen in his ambitious plan. Zhu's career was similarly stumped despite the considerable progress of the National Revolution. This revolutionary veteran remained an insignificant local official for years, suspecting that Chen Jitang restrained his promotion on purpose.\n\nTherefore, Zhu and Hu co-founded the so-called \"Datong National Salvation Army\", wielding it against Chen Jitang. This army never seemed to be an actual threat, but Governor Chen responded to this stupendous audacity with a firm and iron fist. What harmed the Kuomintang more than the loss of a veteran cadre was the aftermath.\n\nHu Hanmin, who condemned the act as an uncivilised move utterly unfounded in the revolutionary practices or history of the Kuomintang, drawing allegories with his own treatment of the New Guangxi Clique, has loudly made his frustrations clear. Hu has brought all powers of the executive down on Governor Chen, who has publicly defended his act as a necessary move to uphold governmental authority. It is becoming evidently clear that the Revolutionary Diarchy is perhaps more utterly fraught than what was believed, with Hu likely working with Xu Chongzhi and Li Liujun to uproot Chen's military dominance."
 GXC.endgame.045.a: "This would serve as a good warning to other plotters against our government."
 GXC.endgame.045.b: "\"He is an utter insult to the meaning of being a revolutionary!\""

 GXC.endgame.046.t: "The Revolutionary Diarchy Exalted!"
 GXC.endgame.046.d: "Hu Hanmin and Chen Jitang have been cooperating, if perhaps estranged, for some time. Previous events such as Zhu's assassination, the pervasive personality cult within Guangdong, and other power plays have shown that the divergence between these two great men is far more than just a rumour. They have thoroughly opposed each other in most cases, and some are even worried that another Guangdong spat was unavoidable. However, in a banquet held in Nanjing, most have recently been convinced that such worries are unfounded.\n\nAs always, Hu orated and pontificated to his comrades with great passion. He praised the success of the NRA, and the role of the military in the tutelage stage. In a rather forced manner, the Chairman clearly alludes to himself and Governor Chen as the basis of the government. Moving on, the Chairman begins another one of his lectures about discipline for his comrades, the proliferation of Sanmin and the nuances of the future of tutelage within the government.\n\nConcluding his speech with a firm and clear voice, reminiscent of his tone in the First Kuomintang National Congress after the victory of the Guangdong Coalition, Hu waved to his comrades amidst a round of applause. Rather humbly treading down the steps of the stage, Chairman Hu began to shake hands with his colleagues. Meeting Chen Jitang's gaze, the Governor saluted without hesitation.\n\nWitnessing such a harmonious scene, it became rather evidently clear to attendees that the two men don't particularly maintain the best relationship. What with Hu reminding Chen of his true position within the Party, the mere stepping stone for the Chairman. And yet, this Revolutionary Diarchy forms the backbone of the present Republic.\n\nAs Governor Chen's face lit up with hushed fear upon Hu's words, the Chairman extended his hand, flashing a keen smile. Returning the offer rather hesitantly, with his own forced grin, the words of Hu Hanmin's speech a mere moment ago rekindled within the attendees' minds..."

 GXC.endgame.060.t: "A New President in the Palace"
 GXC.endgame.060.d: "Despite our clique's momentous rise to the throne of the National Revolution, becoming the true kingmaker on the future of the Chinese nation and its people, only until recently was it clearly evident who the real face of the Kuomintang was, and with the long awaited resignation of the feeble Lin Sen, the infallible mastermind Li Zongren has acquired the much deserved title of President of China.\n\nHowever, not all are supportive of the stratocratic turn for the Kuomintang, with the public continuing to maintain an \"unreasonable attitude\" towards the New Guangxi Clique. Although in reality none of this is truly a concern for the leadership of the clique, as a convened meeting with the quadrumvirate — Bai Chongxi, Li Zongren, Huang Shaohong and Huang Xuchu — held hastily after news of Lin Sen's resignation, dictated that the role of the President of China would be transitioned out of a figurehead role, and granted full extensive powers to be utilised as seen fit. Naturally, the implication exists that with his new sweeping powers, Li Zongren will be able to implement the successful governance of Guangxi nationwide, with unflinching authority.\n\nA further bonus to the prestigious title is the esteemed, newly constructed $100,000 \"Chinese White House\", albeit the moniker clashes with the yellow walls, and blue tiled roof, the connotations of such an attributed nickname remain the same. Whilst having existed for the entire duration of Lin Sen's tenure as President, the humble and modest figure never ventured to occupy the fancy lodgings, preferring to remain put in his current home, perhaps as a form of protest or even to reflect that he is of equal footing with the common Chinese. Whatever the case, the building will now serve as an extravagant display of its new master's newfound power and influence, for China is now fully under the auspices of the New Guangxi Clique."

 GXC.endgame.061.t: "Guangxi and the Rural Reconstruction"
 GXC.endgame.061.d: "Extensibly throughout the Chinese nation, there remains a severe magnitude of mismanagement, abuse, and inefficiency in the nation's land utilisation. Dr. Sun Yat-sen knew this, and devised his economic programme for National Reconstruction. Huang Xuchu, interprets Dr. Sun's economic programme in a far more visionary light than his peers. Devising it as a form of economy with public ownership of the means of production, management of all productive enterprises would remain with the government, with all private concerns that have an important relationship with the economic standards of the people, or with the defence of the nation being subject to enforced public regulation. However, a key distinguishing factor is that private ownership remains an opportunity for those enterprising enough to take it.\n\nIn terms of educating the masses, New Guangxi initially experimented with universities focused on physical and biological sciences, with expanded curricula and faculties, however that was deemed unnecessary for the needs of the nation, and so the current economic programme follows an extensive training of village cadres with a focus on banking, mining, law and government. With this practical outlook, the clique aims to prepare trained personnel corresponding to the needs of Chinese society.\n\nIn a more revolutionary flash compared to Huang Xuchu's thorough top down approach is the Rural Reconstruction Movement, a common associate of the New Guangxi Clique. Led by Liang Shunming, the movement seeks to implement and assist in a bottom up approach of National Reconstruction. Differing on the promotion of local development under the direction of official local government institutions, Liang desires the economic programme to be a project conjured from the peasants themselves. With another key power player in the Quadvirumrate, Bai Chongxi has yielded a tacit endorsement of Liang Shunming's movement, albeit the final decision remains with [ROOT.GetLeader]."

 GXC.endgame.062.t: "The Basic Programme of National Reconstruction"
 GXC.endgame.062.d: "On their tireless crusade to bring the renowned and successful Guangxi model to the rest of the provinces, the New Guangxi Clique has set out to codify their National Reconstruction programme. Being nominally inspired by Dr. Sun's own reconstruction plan, the now National endeavour, has been modified by both Huang Xuchu and Huang Shaohong to suit the militaristic requirements of the New Guangxi Clique.\n\nFirstly, the programme deems Sanmin doctrine to be the only appropriate principles for the Chinese revolution and the whole populace. Secondly, it is imperative that during the current stage of the National Revolution, the nation and people come together to fight against imperialism and the power of feudalism. All universal rights of the people or improvements in livelihood must be considered on the basis of the struggle for national liberation.\n\nFurthermore, in order to produce people that contribute to society, it is necessary to increase organisation and training of the people. In order to implement this, the New Guangxi clique have created \"The Three Self Policies\", being Self Defence, Self Government and Self Sufficiency, with the aims to entirely devote the people to military reconstruction whilst also keeping in mind the guiding principle of People's Livelihood.\n\nIn lockstep with the fundamentals of the programme comes the emphasis on political, economic and cultural reconstruction, with a focus on anti-corruption and integration with the militia system, land reform and economic revitalisation, and universal education, respectively. Finally, the clique have applied their own addendum to the programme, advocating for the rigorous implementation of the militia system to all provinces within China, together with eventual merging of the army and militia.\n\nAll in all, the New Guangxi Clique's revolutionary National Reconstruction programme may be viewed as a corruption of Dr. Sun's intent, however they cannot deny the success of such a model within the home province."

 GXC.endgame.062.b: "This is a breach of Provincial Security!"

 GXC.endgame.063.t: "Puritanism in Education"
 GXC.endgame.063.d: "Mirroring the very roots in which the clique grew from, the New Guangxi Clique's high leadership shares very reserved, strict and puritanical views on society. Having been the case in Guangxi for the years under their tenure, a campaign of continued suppression of love songs, wasteful instrument playing, the propagandisation of patriotic and military songs remains in place, with plans to extend it across the nation. Alongside music, there exists the suppression of tai, the concept of maternal grandmothers bringing expensive gifts following the birth of their grandchildren — deemed an unreasonable financial drain on households — amongst others. Further more, strong opposition to long braids commonly worn by peasant women exists, with the consideration that they attract disease and dirt, with the belief that short haired women were puritanical, militarised, literate and prepared to use their regained strength to serve the nation.\n\nWhilst these programs of stamping out expression have been deemed a success in Guangxi province, many critics have pointed that such initiatives hamper the development of intellectualism. In response to this, President Li Zongren has expressed his clear belief that education — alongside defence — were responsibilities of the government, and although they differed in form they shared the same reality and remained inseperable. The education of the people had to be determined by the needs of their society, with today's student being tomorrow's citizen, and the citizen was the nation's defender after all. Those lacking the ability to defend the nation lacked the requirements for citizenship."
 GXC.endgame.063.a: "A harsh crackdown on frivolity."
 GXC.endgame.063.b: "We are not an autocracy!"

 GXC.endgame.064.t: "Theory of Democracy"
 GXC.endgame.064.d: "Like all factions within the Kuomintang, the New Guangxi Clique is no different in their staunch belief of the importance of democracy in society, being a cornerstone of Dr. Sun's Three People's Principles, however the New Guangxi differs on their interpretation of the limits of democracy, and what it means to truly implement such a desired form of governance.\n\nRefusing to allow democracy to conflict with the needs of national mobilisation, the New Guangxi definition of democracy harkens itself to be closer to \"expression of general will\". In Bai Chongxi's eyes, self-government specifically meant local self-government, defining that local villages could manage local affairs as long as it did not conflict with the higher echelons of government. Secondly, local self-governments would have to organise the population to their fullest extent possible to fulfil local public duties, with democracy having to awaken the masses to their own self-interest, provide an organised voice, and provide an organisational framework to translate sentiment into effective action.\n\nHowever the concept of local elections has been staunchly rejected, as Li Zongren found that most qualified people viewed politics too pessimistically to serve, instead opting for a class of magistrates that would be shifted amongst districts. With local governments failing, how can the national government succeed? Instead, during the political tutelage phase, the clique seeks to train a new class of officials at each level of governance.\n\nAlongside such schemes is a compulsive adult literacy programme, mandatory village assemblies to provide information on important national affairs, laws and regulations, alongside local ones, albeit the latter has seen limited participation, with some households having sent child representatives to the assembly. The dream of achieving democracy continues to remain an elusive and difficult one, yet no one can deny that New Guangxi truly aspires for democratic governance."

 GXC.endgame.064.b: "To think, it would all lead to this?"

 GXC.endgame.065.t: "For Whom the Bells Toll"
 GXC.endgame.065.d: "Hu Hanmin, ever proud, ever enigmatic, ever stubborn, refused to enter political exile for his own safety after his ousting, instead choosing to remain within his home in Guangzhou, basically daring Li Zongren to issue an arrest warrant. Li refrained from making any open move against the ex-Chairman, preferring to merely keep his house under surveillance. Only rare visits from the likes of Lin Sen, Chen Mingshu, and Zou Lu appear to flash light into Hu's dark abode.\n\nIn a rather ironic turn of events, the unfolding intellect and headstrong mind of the ex-Chairman seemed to have been his undoing. During one of Hu Hanmin's frequent chess matches, an act he has reportedly become quite renowned for as a local champion, it would appear that he had an unfortunately fatal brain aneurysm in the midst of the match, later being declared dead at the scene.\n\nMany close to the ex-Chairman reported Hu's clearly shaken, dishevelled, and sickly nature following what could only be interpreted as, in his eyes, the utter collapse of the National Revolution. Those within the New Guangxi's upper echelons posit far more nefarious enquiries as to the ex-Chairman's final moments. Whatever the case, most within the clique have deemed it a happy accident, despite claims that the dire conditions of his living space contributed to his decline — some even daring to make blatant accusations of foul play.\n\nWith Li finally rid of perhaps his greatest adversary, there have been suggestions that the President maintain his outwardly nonchalant attitude towards the lackeys of the Elders Clique, perhaps even being respectful towards the death of the once great statesman. After all, Li is not a monster, and Hu himself had many loved ones, even the adoration of the nation, all of whom will mourn his loss. However, one cannot always rest upon their laurels, and exploiting such an opportunity would allow Li to forever cast the internal party opposition to the dustbin of history."

 GXC.endgame.065.b: "...Let's make one of our own."

 GXC.endgame.066.t: "Reconstruct Guangxi, Revive China!"
 GXC.endgame.066.d: "And so the land that was long divided has reunited again, this time under a vastly different leader. Like many before him, Li Zongren came from humble (but not too humble) roots, before rising to the occasion to save his people. Through his military and political talents as well as that of his allies, General Li has emerged from a province that most wrote off as backwards and underdeveloped to become President of a reunited Republic of China.\n\nThis Republic is very different from the ones that came before it, and Li Zongren is a very difficult man than the young failed soldier turned gym teacher that first joined the Xinhai revolution. From a Xinhai revolutionary to a warlord soldier to an opportunistic general to a Kuomintang exile to a radical militia proponent to a sometime liberal, Li Zongren has worn many different identities with varying degrees of conviction. He captains his ship much in the same way he once governed his province and once generalled his army, insisting on the strictest discipline for his civilian and military lieutenants alike.\n\nThe Kuomintang too has changed, moulded in the image of its new Chairman. Bai Chongxi once called Guangxi the \"Cradle of Revolution\", an arrogant boast once but now a reality. With the slogan \"Reconstruct Guangxi, Revive China\", the Guangxi model is now one for the entire nation to emulate, blending the Three Principles Dr. Sun once laid out for his party with the pragmatic needs of a nation on constant guard from invasion.\n\nThe end result is a Republic that few others know. A dictatorship to be sure, but not quite a military one even if helmed by a former General. A democracy in letters, if rarely in practice, praised by certain men of republican inclination. A state for its citizens, each armed and trained by law, but rooted in a higher purpose in Chinese nationalism. A Kuomintang party-state, but without any of its original founders. Despite its contradictions going forward, it is united in one goal:"

 ##Shared Events (100-119)

 GXC.endgame.100.t: "The Spirit of Reform"
 GXC.endgame.100.d: "Nobody would have believed that the near insurmountable position of Hu Hanmin could ever be bested whilst he reigned on the throne, and yet after the much anticipated National Third Congress waxed and waned, such a figment of imagination has become reality. With the stable election of the constitutionalist [ROOT.GetLeader] to the Premiership of the Kuomintang, the spark of democracy bellows once more under the reignited hope that the fulfillment of elections, and the end of Tutelage, will be more than just a nascent dream, but a guaranteed reality for the Chinese nation. The slightest embers of a more broadened political front has mobilised a sheer magnitude of energised politicians from across all avenues of the political spectrum, intent on having their influence on shaping the future for China.\n\nYet such an overwhelming flood of sudden campaigning, burgeoning parties forming, Kuomintang influence waning, it has brought with it intense instability, with many within the party fearing that if [ROOT.GetLeader] and their faction don't manage to keep the lid on things, the party, the National Revolution itself might very much collapse under its own weight.\n\nTo stack onto the mounting issues for the fresh leadership, the crucial question of the Republic's constitution has bubbled to the surface, for Hu Hanmin's clique preferred to rule through Organic Laws as opposed to a written, codified constitution, yet this has been one of the very promises made by the [ROOT.GetRulingParty]. Whatever it may be, one thing is for sure..."
 GXC.endgame.100.a: "Democracy beckons..."

 GXC.endgame.101.t: "The Disease of the Heart"
 GXC.endgame.101.d: "The nation may be nominally united upon the White Sun, Blue Sky and Wholly Red Earth, however underneath the surface rests a disgusting plague that has afflicted the Chinese Nation since time immemorial. Warlords. Even in the Kuomintang's unending, enduring, crusade against the glorified bandits, fresh warlords always appear to replace the old.\n\nIn addition to their consistent presence, they have been emboldened by what they would consider the weak, invalid democratic leadership, too focused on the perfidious idea of \"democracy\" to cast nary a sight on their activities. However, such a position is a fool's one to take, for whilst the government is experiencing temporary troubles in a time of monumental transition, the might of the Kuomintang remains infallible in these times of their zenith. The challenge of dislodging the warlords may prove to be considerable, but the Kuomintang has survived worse."
 GXC.endgame.101.a: "The Warlords are restless..."

 GXC.endgame.102.t: "The Call for Change"
 GXC.endgame.102.d: "As the iron grip the Party-state once had on the Chinese nation relaxes, if only a little, the far more liberal atmosphere has led to an increase in what many in the previous administration would've considered anti-revolutionary practice. Students, teachers, journalists, all unite together in a harmonious symphony directed at rallying against their perceived injustices of the current revolutionary government.\n\nDrawing spotlights on critical issues such as corruption, social conservatism, and authoritarianism, many in the party have actually welcomed such attention on the flaws of the nation, for it is easier to exercise the political will to crack down on such issues if there is significant popular support from the masses. However this has swiftly spiraled into broader rallying cries for changes to the nation and administration that the Kuomintang is hesitant to support, and even would rather be silenced.\n\nFears of such movements evolving further into outright opposition towards the party has led to many of the present leadership considering this to be another of the new administration's critical issues, for how can we provide for the people if they oppose us at every turn?"
 GXC.endgame.102.a: "Our youth lament..."

 GXC.endgame.103.t: "The [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Horsetrade"
 GXC.endgame.103.d: "With the inauguration of our newly anointed Five Yuan Government, each governmental organ has yielded a bountiful harvest of fresh administrative and bureaucratic positions to be delegated however it is deemed necessary by the current government. However, there is the precedent, and even the expectation that each position is carefully balanced between the current main Kuomintang Factions — Western Hills, Reconstruction and Elders — to maintain a cohesive, unified force from all perspectives of governance.\n\nMost coveted of all the newly inundated positions is that of Premier of the Legislative Yuan, a position expected to be handed to a figure from a different faction than the President, as a demonstration of good will between the disparate factions. Of the two leading figures in the race for Legislative Yuan, the loser is expected to be appointed to Premier of the prestigious yet less powerful Judicial Yuan, whilst the leaders of the smaller factions are expected to receive the Premierships of the Control and Examination yuans.\n\nIn a similar fashion, the other positions within the legislature, such as Vice Premier, and Secretary General of the Legislative Yuan will be distributed in a balanced way. Taking an introspective, some are considering if such a carefully decided set of affairs would even advance the Kuomintang's march towards democracy, or if it will just beget further and further gridlock of opposing ideals."
 GXC.endgame.103.a: "Appoint Sun Fo."

 GXC.endgame.103.c: "Appoint Hu Hanmin."

 GXC.endgame.104.t: "The National Salvation Conference"
 GXC.endgame.104.d: "Not a rare sentiment shared amongst the more civilian membership of the Kuomintang — although most enthusiastically, and perhaps loudly, held by Sun Fo — many lamented how critical KMT figures would take on multiple party and governmental jobs simultaneously, effectively amounting power and concentrating it in overstretched, underqualified individuals who could not effectively provide assistance to the government.\n\nThus with the newly constitutional turn of the Kuomintang, many personnel within the party have consistently demanded a rule to be applied that no active military personnel could be President or Premier of any of the Five Yuans, a one-man-one-post policy as Premier, and even the stipulation that members cannot participate on multiple councils.\n\nIn a collaborative effort, the three dominant figures of the current government, Sun Fo, Ju Zheng and Hu Hanmin, have all co-written the \"Outline of the Principles for Controlling Politics during the Period of Political Tutelage and the Methods of Handling Chinese Foreign Policy\", a long-winded yet assertive piece advocating, and perhaps even mandating, the end of military rule and the proper initiation of the functions of the Five Yuan government.\n\nSuch a position is not without its detractors however, as key figures within the current military structure such as Chen Jitang staunchly oppose any limitation on their influence, championing against inaccurate assessments of performance of individuals holding simultaneous military and civilian roles. However with the dominance of the constitutionalist factions of the KMT, his cries rest on deaf ears."
 GXC.endgame.104.a: "A government free of military influence."

 GXC.endgame.105.t: "The Political Consultative Council"
 GXC.endgame.105.d: "Ever an emblematic light, a rallying point even, the drafting of a new constitution has been the consistent life goal for Sun Fo, for he has championed relentlessly against the authoritarian, and sometimes arbitrary decisions made by the ruling caste of the Kuomintang during its tenure. With the democratic influences having finally wrested control from the more authoritarian, he has led the charge in pushing towards the drafting of a new constitution for the nation, to reflect the consistent march towards equitable governance handled by consensus, not autocracy.\n\nAppointing a constitution drafting committee, Sun sits as chairman adjourned by Wu Chaoshu and Zhang Zhiben. Included in this committee are the likes of Fu Bingchang, Liang Hancao, Wu Shangying, and many others. Ju Zheng's Western Hills and Hu Hanmin's Elders Clique have begun applying pen to paper in the lengthy drafting process, ironing out all of the details between. However there have been increasingly louder calls from even more radical members of the KMT to allow the external parties, the Dangwai, to participate in the drafting process. Such a brazen invitation carries heavy implications, for a combined effort not just from the Kuomintang, but would imply that the constitution being drafted as it is now would be the final product.\n\nHowever, such a broad extension of acceptance towards the external parties could truly be the difference between a flourishing democracy, and one that is stagnant, with the Kuomintang merely using elections as justification for their continued reign. Nonetheless, Western Hills and the Elders Clique have pushed against such a notion. Sun and Reconstruction for their part, remain on the fence, for whilst Sun himself has been quoted in stating that \"we must draft a constitution in accordance with the Three People's Principles, and we must not deviate either from its spirit, its content, or its form.\", he nonetheless is privy to shoring up Reconstruction's might with Dangwai support."
 GXC.endgame.105.a: "We shall not disavow Dr. Sun."
 GXC.endgame.105.b: "An outside perspective is needed."

 GXC.endgame.106.t: "Rights and Duties of the People"
 GXC.endgame.106.d: "As one of the most significant acts in deciding the future of the National Revolution, and the Chinese nation, the penning of the new Republican Constitution will require arduous effort and strides made on general consensus between all cooperating parties in order to ensure that the labour, the sacrifices, the turmoil of the last decades will all have been worth it in the name of progress.\n\nLeading the charge, [ROOT.GetLeader] has decided to disregard the last implemented constitution by the Kuomintang, the 1912 Provisional Constitution, for it has been deemed unfit for purpose in the new age of the party. However, there remains the will to draw inspiration from certain aspects, such as the rights of the people.\n\nBeing a relatively uncontroversial section of the constitution, the second chapter of the constitution, \"Rights and Duties of the People\" guarantees a plethora of freedoms and liberties to the Chinese citizen. The various articles securing the equal treatment of all citizens irrespective of origin or background before the law, freedom of residence, of religion, of assembly and others.\n\nAlthough only the beginning, relatively few voices sounded any opposition to this section of the constitution, with the combined efforts of Reconstruction, Western Hills and the Elders, perhaps the future of China is decided easier than most."
 GXC.endgame.106.a: "Passed, unanimously."

 GXC.endgame.107.t: "The Role of the National Assembly"
 GXC.endgame.107.d: "Alas, such smooth sailing was not to be promised, for the next chapter in the constitution has raised a series of critical concerns from all amongst the political spectrum. The controversial third chapter, \"The National Assembly\" raises the concept of instituting a governmental body to represent and exercise the political powers on behalf of the whole citizenry, transitioning the governmental structure into that of a tricameral parliamentary system. Whilst some — notably Hu Hanmin and his Elders Clique — oppose even the concept of parliamentarianism, accusing [ROOT.GetLeader] of betraying Dr. Sun's ideals, the article that received the most uproar is that of Article 26.\n\nCodifying the composition of such an assembly, and the distribution of its elected delegates, the article stipulates that \"one delegate shall be elected from each hsien, municipality, or area of equivalent status\", however with the added caveat that if its population exceeds 500,000, an additional delegate shall be elected for each additional 500,000. Such a number is deemed unreasonable by a plurality of Kuomintang members, for this would result in the National Assembly containing perhaps thousands of assemblymen, the largest in the world in fact.\n\nHowever opposition is not nearly total, as many actually see such a broad assembly as being necessary to truly represent the views of every individual Chinese citizen, and advocate for its implementation as it currently is, although they are almost immediately detracted by the likes of Zou Lu, Ju Zheng, Zhang Ji, Hu Hanmin and other less idealistic statesmen, who simply insist that such a bureaucratic nightmare would nearly construct another useless body of power."
 GXC.endgame.107.a: "Full representation for the Chinese people!"
 GXC.endgame.107.b: "Truly you cannot be serious? Every five hundred thousand?"
 GXC.endgame.107.c: "Representatives elected by each province, allocated on provincial population."

 GXC.endgame.108.t: "Extent of the Chinese President"
 GXC.endgame.108.d: "In yet another roadblock on the road to promulgation of the new constitution, the role and affairs of the President has come into question. Whilst all come to a common consensus that the role of the President should not carry any true autocratic powers, instead remaining a form of figurehead, many query as to where exactly the President should be situated within the governmental structure.\n\nBeing the Head of State, representing the nation in foreign affairs, having supreme command of all branches of the military, and effectively serving as the overarching face of the government, some within the council have suggested that the President be attached to the Executive Yuan as it functionally serves to exert the will of the executive.\n\nIn counterpoint to this, the more cabinet oriented members of the council have raised the concept that the President should merely serve as a mediator between the Five Yuans, bridging the gap and ensuring continued smooth governance in times of political turmoil. Existing in a state of overall authority within every governmental organ, the President would be an advisory figure of all branches.\n\nThe Elders for their part have backed attachment to the executive, hoping to retain some strength and authority within the role of Head of State. On the opposite end, Reconstruction has seen it fit to insist upon the advisory position of the President, sending the clear message of their belief in the primacy of the Five Branches. Situated within the middle in this dialectical debate, Western Hills has been coaxed by both sides of the Council. With certain members privy towards a strong president, whilst others privy towards Song Jiaoren's ideal of the \"responsible cabinet\", it would appear they are the kingmaker."
 GXC.endgame.108.a: "A mediator, unbiased in principles, pragmatic in action!"
 GXC.endgame.108.b: "It is only natural that the Presidency resides in the Executive, no?"

 GXC.endgame.109.t: "Matters of the Vice Presidency"
 GXC.endgame.109.d: "In another avenue of contention from the conception of the role of the President, the existence of a Vice President has been brought to question. Serving a role similarly akin to the President, the Vice President would also serve as a component in presenting the Chinese nation towards the rest of the world, and whilst not carrying any serious political power, would still have their words heeded by the rest of the government, being its second most senior figure. At least on paper.\n\nOf course, the existence of the Vice Presidency has raised multiple objections and accusations, insinuating that such a position is the institution of bureaucracy for bureaucracy's sake, and should be completely disregarded. Notably raising the point that if the President were to perish in office or otherwise not be able to function, surely the President of the Executive Yuan can serve as acting President until the crisis is concluded, as opposed to the creation of an entirely new, practically useless position to serve as a backup.\n\nProponents of the Vice Presidency insist upon the United States model, drawing comparisons that have gained them particular ire. Pushed for by Sun Fo and his Reconstruction Faction, he insists that the role of the Vice President would allow even the President to have immediate council, one that isn't privy to the interests of the various Yuans."
 GXC.endgame.109.a: "Even the President needs his Second-in-Command."
 GXC.endgame.109.b: "We'll do perfectly fine without another bureaucrat."

 GXC.endgame.110.t: "Fate of the Executive Yuan"
 GXC.endgame.110.d: "As the matter of the Presidency and Vice Presidency is settled, the constitutional council has now swiftly changed focus onto administrative powers, ironing ou the specific limits and powers of the Executive Yuan. With a generally agreed consensus that the Executive Yuan shall be the highest administrative organ of the state, the Executive Yuan will have a President, Vice President, Ministers, Chairmen of Commissions, and a specific amount of Ministers without Portfolio.\n\nWith the persistent precedence that the President of the Republic shall appoint all critical positions within a governmental organ, and with the agreement that the President of Republic itself should be a fairly weak role — incomparable to the Presidents of the nation's past — with a resilient cabinet based government and a strong legislature, the issue of the extent of the Premier of the Executive Yuan's power has been brought to the forefront.\n\nA large group of Kuomintang members from the Elders Clique have proposed the idea that the Premier of the Executive Yuan should in fact be a hefty post, carrying similar powers to that of Prime Ministers within countries like Canada, whilst others from more cautiously minded cliques such as Western Hills have advocated for the Premier to similarly be a weak position, beholden to the consensus of the cabinet."
 GXC.endgame.110.a: "Decisive action requires a strong Premier!"
 GXC.endgame.110.b: "Legislature and cabinets should take precedence, not individuals."

 GXC.endgame.111.t: "Deciding the Fate of the Premier"
 GXC.endgame.111.d: "In another blow to the smooth penning of the constitution, those within the Kuomintang crusading for a strong legislature and weak executive have brought up their issues with the appointment of the Premier of the Executive Yuan in the first place. Effectively serving as the primary force in actual administrative decisions, having the cooperation of the President of both the Republic and Executive Yuan in agreement with the Premier of the Executive Yuan is integral to good, smooth governance.\n\nIn conjunction with this, the current constitution explictily states that the power to appoint the Premier is granted exclusively to the President of the Republic, with consent from the Legislature. However multiple objections have been brought up, instead insisting that the experts within the Legislative Yuan should be the prioritised force behind appointing the Premier, with the President merely providing the rubber stamp.\n\nTheir reasoning — perhaps drawn from the horrors of Beiyang's bureaucracy — is to prevent a nepotistic conjoined power sharing agreement wherein two key individuals, President and Premier, dominate the government's daily functions, although many have thrown accusations of paranoia and needless complication of the constitutional process in the direction of the proponents, majority of which happen to constitute the Reconstruction Faction. Running in counterpoint to this train of thought, the Elders Clique has instead proposed increasing the strength of the president by allowing the position to appoint all cabinet members, not just the premier."
 GXC.endgame.111.a: "We will not be beholden to corruptible individuals."
 GXC.endgame.111.b: "President picks Premier, reserved for their best judgement."
 GXC.endgame.111.c: "Go with Hu's suggestion, the President cannot be hamstringed by the Cabinet."

 GXC.endgame.112.t: "Affairs of Local Governance"
 GXC.endgame.112.d: "In a surprising turn of events, the rest of the articles and chapters of the constitution were passed with nary a single protest in their specifics or implementation. The roles and structure of the Legilsative, Judiciary, Examination and Control Yuans, most featuring a similar President-Vice President structure, with each having the capacity to enact their specific functions as deemed necessary by their members.\n\nAlbeit, like a spectre from the past continuing to haunt the Kuomintang, the issue of provincial autonomy has reigned havoc on the recent discussion of the past days, as the true extent of the Central Government in contrast to Local Governments comes under fire from those more privy to Federalist ideals. In the current setup, the Central Government has the power of legislation and administration for a myriad of critical components of running the country, such as the judiciary system, national law, national defence and foreign affairs amongst others, however it has been granted the power to delegate administration of the education, banking, forestry, industry, commerce, police, public health and other local issues towards the provincial governments themselves.\n\nSome are proposing that instead of the Central government merely being able to grant the power of Administration to provincial governments on a whim, these rights should instead be guaranteed to the local governments on the basis that they could better manage and implement these regional powers based on local issues at hand. This would allow the Central government to focus on being the beating heart of governance.\n\nYet such a proposition has extensive backlash from the majority of the Council, practically earning its proponents political exile the very moment such a concept left their lips. To repudiate the Centralist Principles of Sun Yat-sen, to repeat the mistakes of the past, and allow the provincial governments too much autonomy to act semi-independently from the Central Government. Its practically sacrilege."
 GXC.endgame.112.a: "Enough with this provincial autonomy, the Central Government is final!"

 GXC.endgame.113.t: "Our Fundamental National Policies"
 GXC.endgame.113.d: "Fortunately, the penning of the constitution and the life of the council is coming to a close. With similar general consensus on the extent of the local governance system, alongside specifying the various powers of election, recall, initiative and referendum that are granted to the people to utilise as they deem fit, the final chapters of the constitution are dawning.\n\nWith the prestigiously named Chapter Thirteen: \"Fundamental National Policies\" forever immortalising the apolitical stance of the military, the disbandment of the political manoeuvring in which the biggest gun dictated policy, the explicit separation of any military official from concurrently holding civil office, and the continued prioritisation of national defence of the nation.\n\nAlongside those articles, the chapter also dictates policy within that of foreign affairs, the national economy, social security, education and culture and finally the specific treatment of those in the frontier regions of the nation. In the end of this long, arduous process, the individual party members themselves can only hope that the constitution promulgated today will forever serve as beacon of hope, stability and the Three People's Principles for decades to come. Perhaps finally Dr. Sun Yat-sen's dream of a free, united, centralist and democratic Republic of China will come to fruition.\n\nSun Fo himself has congratulated the committee all across the board, holding true to his heart that \"we have drafted laws that are suitable to a modern nation. The laws we drafted are progressive, and reasonable. Not only do we surely feel very satisfied, but we have undoubtedly won favourable comments and praise from legal experts abroad\". With the final chapter indicating the enforcement and amendment of the constitution if the need ever arises, all that is left is for constitutional draftees on the council to inscribe their names onto paper..."

 ##WHC Events (120-139)
 GXC.endgame.120.t: "Western Hills at the Helm"
 GXC.endgame.120.d: "The dust has settled in the aftermath of the Third National Congress, the inter-party politicking is over, and the Western Hills stand triumphant. When the first match, the Xishan Conference, was held in the western hills suburbs of Beijing, the vision of leading the Kuomintang was a far one. Now the old comrades of Sun Yat-sen and Song Jiaoren have finally taken the wheel of power. The fruit borne from the \"Fourth Plenary Session of the First Central Committee of the Kuomintang\", it has finally paid dividends.\n\nChairman Ju immediately outlined their vision for the future of China. One of compassion, of constitutionalism, of benevolence and love. For the rule of domineering warlords like Li Zongren, despotic demagogues like Wang Jingwei, and perfidious socialistic infiltrators such as Wang's accomplices is over. Now as initially ordained by the Guofu, the National Revolution shall be that of a Tridemist one. Without any pervasive alien concepts such as socialism to pervert China's true orthodox revolutionary model.\n\nSupported by military men such as the renowned Marshal Li Liejun, or admirable General Xu Chongzhi, the Chairman's policy has also been backed by the extremists and moderates of the clique. As the existence of the United Front has all but fell with the prospects of the Left Kuomintang's Central Committee, there is no longer a need to be so fractured as before. However, there still remains a differing opinion as to the treatment of those party members that did align, or support, the United Front.\n\nTo this end Western Hills has already begun to flex their judicial, legalist, and constitutional muscles. Wanting to move forward into the future while respecting what's come before, the Western Hills clique may not be as radical as some of their reckless comrades in the KMT, but now is not the time for the violence of Revolution, now is the time to rebuild and to heal from the wounds over a century old. Synthesising tradition and revolution, this is their ultimate task."

 GXC.endgame.121.d: "Land reform is a keystone policy for the KMT, and the Western Hills clique is no different in this regard. What is different however, is their approach to the question. Unlike the left and the Socialists, the Westerns Hills believe that land reform does not need to be a violent process, and that it should have four major goals. 1.) To improve the countryside. 2.) To raise the standards of education. 3.) To provide peasants with economic aid. 4.) To enact laws protecting the status of the peasants and their basic interests.\n\nTo this end, Western Hills member Shi Ying has written their \"Conservative land reform\" plan (even if in practice it is still far more radical than Beiyang would ever deign). With three major pillars, it states that the State should write legislation to allot lands and profits to peasants, establish cooperatives and provide peasants with loans to start them off, and most substantially, that the State should cultivate lands currently unused, and move peasants to these lands in order to have them no longer go to waste.\n\nHowever, not all the Western Hills agree on this plan, a more radical Land Reform, closer to Sun Fo and the Reconstruction factions ideas involving state control of rice prices and having the Government serve as the mediator between the Landowners and Peasants, has been proposed by Shen Dingyi. A notable outlier for his repeated Pro-Peasant and pseudo-populist efforts, Shen has a rich history of continued organisation of peasant reformist associations. Amongst his plans is the implementation of a 30% cut in land allowance and a 25% rent reduction. A far cry from the stern approach of the mainline Western Hills, it has raised much concern within the upper ranks of acting as an intermediary for radicalism. However, Shen has won the support of much of the factions outside Western Hills."
 GXC.endgame.121.a: "Land reform is too important to compromise on, go with Shi Ying's plan."
 GXC.endgame.121.b: "We need everyone on board for this, go with Shen Dingyi's plan."

 GXC.endgame.122.t: "Remembering the First Republic"
 GXC.endgame.122.d: "The old Beiyang Republic was, by many accounts, a mess of contradictions. What should have been China's first steps towards Democracy and a brighter future was instead corrupted. However, not all who worked within Beiyang were traitors. Many were ardent Democrats trying their hardest to make the best of a bad situation, trapped by the corruption of those around them. It is natural for them to be sympathetic of course, for Western Hills owes its legacy to the Constitutional Club formed within the Beiyang political system by Zhang Ji and others.\n\nNow that the Party-State has liberated China from Beiyang's corruption, it has also liberated these minds to work freely. But the concept of introducing them into our government directly or not, is another question entirely. Zhang Ji and Xu Chongzhi have correctly brought up that Feng Yuxiang and the Guominjun granted them their place of asylum, in the Westerns Hills of Beijing, which gave the clique its name in the first place. Insisting that not repaying such kindness would be remiss of the clique.\n\nThe Chairman himself has brought forth the interesting possibility of working with Beiyang Democrats, conservatives and the like. Those that remained idealistic in the dimming stranglehold of the Five Races. Whilst not necessarily Kuomintang, they nonetheless would serve a purpose once the period of Tutelage has ended, and the period of Constitutional Rule has begun.\n\nFinally, and most attractive to the Western Hills Clique, is Li Liejun and Xie Chi's proposal. That of inviting the Kuomintang's fellow first sons; the Political Science Clique. Whilst it is true that Political Science long cast their lot with Beijing, even arranging multiple attempts to oust the Guofu, it is nonetheless admirable that Huang Fu, Gu Zhongxiu, Zhang Yaozeng, Li Genyuan and their old guard continued to trifle autocrats at every turn. They may be pariahs in the party, but so was Western Hills once upon a time."
 GXC.endgame.122.a: "The Beiyang idealists can participate, but shut them out of any true power."
 GXC.endgame.122.b: "Salutations to Huang Fu and Political Science!"
 GXC.endgame.122.c: "Zhang and Xu have a point, we must repay Feng for his kindness."

 GXC.endgame.123.t: "The Traditionalist revival"
 GXC.endgame.123.d: "Chinas traditional religions, Buddhism, Daoism, and Confucianism, are one of the most important keystones of Chinese culture. Most of Western Hill's members would identify as Buddhists, but many also fall under Daoism and Confucianism. Chairman Ju Zheng even has some sympathies to the moderate elements of the Yiguandao movement. As has become practical tradition, and even an element of detraction for the various Western Hills members, the membership are the epoch of Confucian statesmen within the Revolutionary Party. Humble practitioners of calligraphy, meditation, and reflection upon one's position in life and as a public servant, it has earned them admiration from much of China's traditionalists. And animosity from its intellectuals.\n\nFor the KMT, a large part of the Neo-Confucian movement has been involed in tying the ideals of Confucianism with the Three Principles outlined by Dr. Sun. With its biggest proponent being that of Dai Jitao, architect of the \"New Right\", Western Hills nonetheless agree with the fundamental basis by which the Three Principles are informed through the Confucian ethos of the nation. Dai for his part has mostly pivoted his beliefs towards \"Humanistic Buddhism\", moving focus from the otherworldly and the dead, to the living and more worldly pursuits, such as education.\n\nSupport for these Neo-Religious movements have been a keystone policy for Western Hills, as while China cannot stay in the past, it must take into consideration the traditional beliefs that comprise national civilisation as it move ever forwards. For one must restore self-confidence in Chinese culture if one is to conclude the National revolution, a National Revolution by the revolutionary forces of every class. As espoused by Lin Sen: \"Through tradition, the nation can restore its national self-confidence and self-esteem. No matter what we do, confidence is the most important thing. As long as we have confidence, we will succeed even if we move mountains and fill the sea.\""

 GXC.endgame.124.t: "Western Hills and the Arts"
 GXC.endgame.124.d: "Premier Zou Lu is a man of many talents. Having gained a reputation for his abilities as a calligrapher and as a writer. When he isn't swamped with his work as Premier, he can usually be found either giving patronage to upcoming artists, or working on his next piece. In fact, just recently the Premier has released an anthology of his works, detailing the history of the Kuomintang, Guangdong's revolutionary currents, and of the Chinese Revolution in totality.\n\nThis collection is simply one example of Premier Zou Lu's skills as a true renaissance man. A prolific writer and poet, he has also composed a whole catalogue of poems and essays. Drawing from Chinese traditional history, and intermixed with revolutionary sentiment, Zou's works have received newfound attention as his position within the national scene has risen.\n\nThat is not all, Zou's artistry is joined by the likes of Marshal Li Liejun's own. Considered one of China's most integral figures of the modern era, Li has managed to spend his free time cultivating his Warrior-Scholar skills in calligraphy and poetry. A studious practitioner of official script, Li is a student of fellow revolutionary Tan Yankai, one of the great Four Masters of Calligraphy.\n\nLi's work is emblematic for its vigour, and strength. His inscription \"Always happy and quiet\" on the Fairy Cave in Lushan Mountain alongside \"The Sun and the Moon are both hanging\" on the Sunglight Rock in Gulangyu Island, Xiamen, have managed to stand the test of time immemorial. In final totality, Li's works chronicalling his storied career, stretching from Xinhai all the way to the present era, have become important reference materials for the Chinese people. Granting uniquely personal insights into Xinhai, the Second Revolution, the National Protection War and Constitutional Protection Movement, Li has truly cemented his legacy."

 GXC.endgame.125.t: "Remembering Song Jiaoren"
 GXC.endgame.125.d: "All across the nation know who Song Jiaoren was. It would be incredibly distasteful to decry him as nothing but a failure, for he was merely a light extinguished too soon. An idealist, one that believed in the sincerity of human compassion, patriotism, and adoration for one's country. Song has continuously championed the cause of the Tongmenghui, even when personal disagreements arose between Sun Wen and Huang Xing. Its silent workhorse, its most diligent draftee, Song nonetheless had his own ambitions.\n\nAdvocating not for Sun Yat-sen's Five Power Constitution, but instead his own constitutional concept of the Separation of Powers, Song similarly rallied against Yuan Shikai's blatant despotism at first notice, insisting on parliamentarianism.\nShot in Shanghai after the election by a Yuan Shikai accomplice, Song would ultimately perish later in hospital, surrounded by Huang Xing, Yu Youren and Liao Zhongkai. However he had never lost his idealism, as even in his last will and testament he had instructed his friends to telegram Yuan Shikai about the assassination, hoping that he would be a martyr to ensure Yuan protected civil rights.\nSong's relevance to Western Hills is critical, as the constitutional parliamentary ideals and \"responsible cabinet system\" promoted by Song, alongside his formal introduction of Ju Zheng to the Kuomintang, have proven to persist even past his death. Nonetheless some figures in the Kuomintang criticised his pivot to electoral politics as the reason the first Revolution failed.\n\nChairman Ju Zheng however, dissented on this opinion. In a speech he gave in honour of the man who brought him into the Party, he reaffirmed Song Jiaoren's democratic legacy in the face of tyranny. Concluding to resounding applause, Ju stepped away from the podium briefly. A deep breath. A glance at the sky, it was a clear day. If he truly wanted to honour Song Jiaoren and his legacy, and continue his mentor's fight, he had a lot more work to do."
 GXC.endgame.125.a: "One step at a time."

 GXC.endgame.126.t: "To Descend from the Hills"
 GXC.endgame.126.d: "\"Benevolence and love are the cornerstone of our culture, they are also the fundamental spirit of the Revolution. Without Benevolence and Love, we cannot find a rallying point and a fundamental base for Universal Harmony. Of course, our aim is to strive for the liberty and equality of our nation, and yet the ulterior aim is to promote the progress of mankind, and by common efforts of mankind, to establish peace in the World, with the responsibility resting with China.\n\nEver since the harkening of the revolutionary call through the formation of the Tongmenghui, the members of the current Western Hills Clique have always sought the freedom and betterment of their people through revolutionary means, devoutly loyal to the Guofu in all efforts. However, socialist infiltration caused the fracturing of the Kuomintang into petty infighting, extinguishing the true heart and soul of the party, the reason they fought and continue to do so; the People's Principles.\n\nThe Western Hills Clique however, naturally have their detractors that would accuse them of an uncompromising stance, betraying the revolution's vision for the future, yet is this peace not inherent to mankind? How can one strive for Datong whilst drawing daggers at his fellows, beholden to foreign ideology? Song Jiaoren sought constitutionalism, a parliamentary democratic republic. Whilst his light was snuffed out by assassination, his ideals continue to live on in all those that lay before us now.\n\nHaving worked to implement a legal system and constitution far surpassing that of their predecessors, [ROOT.GetLeader] and the rest of Western Hills continue to work towards the fulfillment of Tutelage, whilst laying the foundations for the future of parliamentary democracy. Hand in hand, together in full unity, the whole Party free of socialist influences shall finish what was birthed in Xinhai all those decades ago: fulfillment of the true ideals of both Dr. Sun Yat-sen and Song Jiaoren, a true Chinese Republic!"

 ##RCF Events (140-159)

 GXC.endgame.140.t: "The Crown Prince and his Party"
 GXC.endgame.140.d: "The dust has settled, and a new Chairman has taken the reins. Sun Fo has finally achieved his dream leading his father's Party and being able to enact his father's will. A liberal dilletante to some, an iron-neck to others, or a mere product of his own father's good name and nepotism. Sun Fo's rise to the much sought after position of Chairman of the Party has blasted all of his detractors with a salvo of his dilligent and hardworking life ethos. Throwing himself into the revolutionary movement from a young age, Sun has continuously championed constitutionalism and democracy, even if he flip-flopped on their exact timetabling within the National Revolution.\n\nNonetheless his energy ever since he has become Chairman is palpable, as he's taken to his work with the vigor of youth not unbeknownst to his reputation. Representing a new page in the history of his Party, one of a more democratic vision, a Revolution tempered by liberalism, and built upon hope. Democracy is not an easy beast to tame, especially in a nation without a democratic tradition, and make no mistake. Sun is not nearly as radical as his fellows in his approach to the National Revolution.\n\nSun is, however, caught between the other two major civilian factions. A Liberal Revolutionary, squeezed between Ju Zheng's more constitutionally conservative minded Western Hills clique and Hu Hanmin's orthodox revolutionary Elders Clique. The Crown Prince of the Kuomintang is not without options, or wit. Pragmatic in choice of allies, Sun and Reconstruction are willing to dalliance with the Left, the Right, and the Dangwai. Remaining true to his own Liberal values and to his father's vision, Sun has large shoes to fill, and a democratic tradition to foster."
 GXC.endgame.140.a: "To the father and son of the Kuomintang."
 GXC.endgame.140.b: "And its other founding fathers."

 GXC.endgame.141.t: "A More Equal Countryside"
 GXC.endgame.141.d: "The question of Land Reform is, quite naturally, one of the most important questions the Kuomintang must address. Inspired by the ideas of his friend and loyalist, the American-educated Wu Shangying - Chairman Sun himself has written up an expansive Land Reform plan already, which comes with three tenets.\n\nFirst, they would reexamine the taxation and land contracts of peasants and landowners, and adjust the tax rate to make it more fair for all, and to unburden them from their heavy workloads. Second, they would put those funds towards the modernisation of agriculture, allowing greater production and bringing in more money for both the Government and the common man.\n\nThird, they would control the sale of rice, rather than the merchants, and therefore control the price of food, improving the lives of the people and bringing in more money for the Government. This would be done by having the farmers give their harvests to the Government directly, and when the landowners demand rice as rent to them, they could simply point the landowners towards the Government, who would give them half the rent in cash and the other half in bonds.\n\nThe plan is, of course, not without its detractors. Questions surrounding the expansion of Bureaucracy being major. We could, of course, reach across the aisle to the Western Hills clique, and pursue a Land Reform more in line with their vision, with less state control in the market and instead focusing on allotting lands and funding to the peasants. Building a land reform model out of educating the peasantry, as opposed to mandated from the government. However this is a dear issue to the Chairman, who strongly believes that his plan is best for all of China."
 GXC.endgame.141.a: "Compromise is necessary, reach out to Western Hills."
 GXC.endgame.141.b: "Chairman Sun's plan is best."

 GXC.endgame.142.t: "The Salvation Daily Incident"
 GXC.endgame.142.d: "While typically painting himself as a civilian leader, or a liberal revolutionary, Sun Fo certainly has made many friends in high and low places. Having good relations with military men such as Zhang Fakui and Xue Yue, the Chairman also has less savoury allies. The infamous gangster Du Yuesheng has kept a number of potentially controversial stories about the Chairman from reaching the spotlight.\n\nDu's reach, however, is not unlimited. Salvation Daily News, led by Gong Debao, had been a major opponent of Sun Fo. Recently they have even claimed he's had an affair with a Shanghai Courtesan by the name of Lan Ni.\n\nEven worse, before the Chairman could properly reply to the accusations levied against him, Zhang Fakui and Xue Yue decided to take matters into their own hands. Storming the Station, they demanded the articles be retracted immediately. Salvation Daily refused to do so, leading to a fight in which eight workers were injured and several printing presses were destroyed.\n\nWhile Sun Fo immediately condemned the violence, the response from the opposition has been swift and incendiary. Ju Zheng gave a speech where he condemned Sun Fo for allowing violence to go unchecked. Next came Zou Lu, pointing out the hypocrisy in Chairman Sun positioning himself as a champion of Free Speech, only to try and stifle the press the second it turned against him. Even the retired Lin Sen made comments about the incident and how Sun has \"Shown clear failings as both a leader and a husband\". Worst of all however, came from Hu Hanmin, who stated that Chairman Sun was \"Nothing more than a child, trying to escape his father's shadow, and staining his legacy in the process.\"\n\nThe Chairman, rebounding from the flurry of vitriol, has scheduled a speech to explain everything, disavowing all claims of any sort of affair. Similarly he has worked to condemn the violence at the news station, stating he would ensure the Station was fairly compensated, and that the people responsible would be punished."
 GXC.endgame.142.a: "What a disaster."

 GXC.endgame.143.t: "Revolution and the Masses"
 GXC.endgame.143.d: "When looking back at the first Northern Expedition, and why it failed, Chairman Sun Fo points to the lack of popular support for the Kuomintang during the first Expedition. He has gone on to state that even though the second Northern Expedition has been successful, the Kuomintang must still earn the support of the peasant-worker masses, and the intellectuals of the nation. To this end, he has created a large-scale programme that will teach the peasant-worker masses the meaning of the Revolution. Cooperating with Shen Junru and Huang Yanpei, Sun intends to foment a democratic tradition.\n\nZou Lu, Western Hills clique member and former President of the Sun Yat-sen University, has decried the plan as an opportunistic power grab, nothing more than a populist move by Sun Fo in an attempt to increase his own power. The Chairman, naturally, counters Zou's arguments, stating that the programme will serve to strengthen the entire Kuomintang's position within the masses, in service of the party in its entirety. Drafting an eloquent speech, \"Revolution and the Masses\", Sun presented his rebuttal:\n\n\"Previously, the military could not win the support of the masses or became the guardian of the masses. This has led to the failure of the revolution. The strength of the revolution must come from the masses. Judging from the present situation, we must let the peasant-worker masses understand the meaning of revolution so that our revolutionary work will still have a hope of success.\"\n\nFollowing attempted retorts by other anti-populists within the party, it is reported that the Chairman has ignored all other criticism, citing that Sun Yat-sen's doctrine must be accepted by all Chinese. Those who oppose such a notion or the incorporation of the masses into steering the direction of the party, Sun posited, are traitors, socialists, monarchists, capitalists, landlords, or ignoramuses who have no true understanding of the spirit of the Three People's Principles."
 GXC.endgame.143.a: "To a Revolutionary future for all!"
 GXC.endgame.143.b: "And let populism rule?"

 GXC.endgame.144.t: "Democratising the Party"
 GXC.endgame.144.d: "As one of the Three Principles of the People, the question of how to fully realise Minquan (Democracy) is often on the Chairman's mind. He believes that if China is to ever become a true Democracy, the Kuomintang must become one first, and lead the Country by example. However one cannot implement Minquan without considering the democratisation of one's own party. For the blind cannot lead the blind.\n\nTo this end, he has spoken extensively on the oligarchic power the Kuomintang holds, and how it must be eroded from within, that the leaders must accept that they cannot permanently be the ruling caste of China, lest the Kuomintang become the greatest threat to its own Revolution. The Party has to show the people, not just with words but with action, his action. And through this action one must present the party's earnest democratic spirit.\n\nThrough sweeping reforms of pluralism and egalitarianism, the enshrining of Freedom of Speech for all allowing anyone to criticise the Government and for their voice to be heard, both within the Party and without. Furthermore, he has strictly enforced honest conduct by the Kuomintang in the electoral process, such as the honest conduct in general elections. Mostly brought forth by Sun's own disappointment and dissatisfaction with the local elections sponsored by the party, in which bogus votes and tallies were commonplace.\n\nExpanding further, the Chairman has proposed a series of plans in order to enact democracy within the nation. The people must be able to elect their representatives in some form, and those representatives should be selected upon merit and not party loyalty. For his father's teachings are not merely just for the Kuomintang, but for the populace as a whole."
 GXC.endgame.144.a: "A brave leap towards Democracy."

 GXC.endgame.145.t: "The Gentry and The Revolution"
 GXC.endgame.145.d: "The Gentry of China form the largest bulwark against Sun's Revolutionary goals. In fact, the Chairman has gone so far as to state that the Gentry were the primary target of the Revolution, that they must be swept aside in order for a new and free China to be created. Chairman Sun believes that many movements towards \"local governance\" during the Warlord Era were nothing more than the Gentry co-opting democratic sentiment to entrench their own power. Local village leaders have been the main drivers towards local self government, but a closer look at these men show they are naught but petty autocrats who desire to keep their own power.\n\nThese local leaders and petty bureaucrats are easily the gravest threat to the Revolution. In order to clean them out Sun Fo has proposed a plan of massive bureaucratic reform, sweeping away the local gentry in favour of those truly committed to Democracy, reforming the chain of command to become smoother and less cumbersome, and finally enshrining the ability for subordinates to speak up about abuses and poor work, creating a system of enforcement to protect those who speak up.\n\nThis is, however, only one half of the equation, the other half was to continue education reform, to make it so the average citizen was properly taught the values of Democracy and how to truly shine, rather than being treated like another cog in a larger machine. If they understood their own worth after all, they would refuse to let the Gentry treat them like machines, breaking the power the Gentry holds.\n\nThe Chairman's task is not easy either, as reporters claim that behind closed doors he has gone so far as to exasperatedly claim that \"to my knowledge, one can hardly find one out of ten of these local leaders who are a decent citizen. All in all, they are just bad gentry. In fact, they are the target of our revolution. Ironically, now they occupy key positions within our government... They are the very people that we have wanted to destroy since we began our revolution, and yet they persist.\""
 GXC.endgame.145.a: "And thus, power shifts from the few to the many."
 GXC.endgame.145.b: "But the Gentry supported the revolution from the beginning!"

 GXC.endgame.146.t: "The Father of the Nation"
 GXC.endgame.146.d: "In the end, Sun Yat-sen's dream of a free, democratic, and reborn Republic of China finally came true. The revolutionary prophet who spent most of his life in exile must have had his share of doubts, but never lost faith even in the end that his Three Principles would be the ones that would bring an end to the Century of Humiliation. Perhaps it is only fitting that Sun Fo would be the one to see it through. Many have and will continue to call the elder Sun their mentor and inspiration in spirit, it is only fitting that the Father of the Republic has many admirers. But he only had one son, one faithful son who preserved despite all odds.\n\nFor President Sun, the second one of his name, this is more than just a dream come true. Since his days in school, separated by oceans and revolutions from his distant parent, he often had nothing but the readings and letters sent to him from the elder statesman to connect with him. Finding his father meant finding the revolution, becoming the world's premier expert in the Eternal Premier through an encyclopaedic knowledge of the latter's teachings combined with a personal ability to decipher the lessons others tried to corrupt. Now, though the Guofu tragically cannot be at his side for this moment, he lives on in spirit through his work and through his spirit and through the blood that runs through Sun Fo's veins.\n\nSun Fo is more than just a living receptacle for his father's work of course. While faithful in carrying out the Eternal Premier's last will, he also embodies something more. A fresh face for a new generation of the party-state, a young leader for a young republic. There will be plenty of stumbling blocks going forward into a new era of political tutelage, a large part caused by the tensions between Sun's lofty promises of change and his promises of democracy, but maybe this really can be the start of that promising future denied to generations past."

###Section 5c (200-299): End Game LKMT Events

 ##Shared Events (200-219)

 GXC.endgame.200.t: "The Red Piedmont"
 GXC.endgame.200.d: "With our banners soaring high across the majority of the nation, it is safe to say that we have moved away from being decried as merely regionalist rulers of the revolution's birthplace. Advancing from Guangzhou in light of the despotic Central Committee, our brave soldiers risked everything to see to it that the National Revolution, and the Chinese Nation State, was salvaged from the jaws of tyranny. Fulfilling the original dream as drawn out by our forefathers and the Guofu all those years ago, this should be a time of great merriment.\n\nAnd yet, there cannot be anything but great sorrow. For brother killed brother, and the revolutionary that was destined to be the people's salvation has brought them increasingly more misery. With an innumerable cost to life, morale, and infrastructure, the years that follow will perhaps be the nation's most crucial. For if the path to recovery is compromised, the nation's fate may follow suit."
 GXC.endgame.200.a: "A China divided, must unite!"

 GXC.endgame.201.t: "Revolutionary Upstarts"
 GXC.endgame.201.d: "Unforeseen by both local and international observers, the unification of China by the [ROOT.GetRulingParty] has wreaked havoc upon the national scene, only exasperated by the gruelling civil war fought between the sister factions of the Kuomintang, and with the final ousting of [CHI.GetLeader], they have asserted themselves as the sole socialist force within China.\n\nWith the rise of [ROOT.GetLeader] to the stage of national prominence, the already fierce counter-revolutionary opposition to the Kuomintang has been bolstered by our inter-factional struggles, with warlord remnants and bandits alike conducting raids against our garrisons and populace. Worse still, our comrades in arms, having always considered the Liangguang branch of the Left Kuomintang to be nothing more but exiled upstarts, continue in their revolutionary struggle against whom they have deemed to be usurpers of the party, waging a protracted campaign of guerilla warfare against our weakened government.\n\nSuch overwhelming counter-revolutionary activity is proving near insurmountable for our new government, and is poised to collapse the newly inundated revolutionaries through sheer force of opposition alone."
 GXC.endgame.201.a: "Well this rather complicates things..."

 GXC.endgame.202.t: "Collapse of the Red Army"
 GXC.endgame.202.d: "As the sheer weight of the civil war and National Revolution crashes down upon our new Socialist government in a tsunami, the sword and shield of the Kuomintang, the very harbinger of our new prominence, has finally buckled under the immense stress it has endured throughout its tenure. Waging a glorious war in the name of the Revolution against the counter-Kuomintang forces, Fengtian and their Japanese overlords, foreign imperialists and finally, their own brothers and sister in arms during the civil war, morale has absolutely crumbled, with the will to fight shattered by the seeming betrayal of Wang Jingwei's Central Executive Committee. Certain divisions of the NRA are even functionally outright mutinying against our government, conspiring with the counter-revolutionary resistance to strike against any official response at every turn.\n\nHaving been built as the primary socialist army for the National Revolution, the army functioned on the desire to see Dr. Sun's Three Principles enacted, and come to fruition, however having committed the ultimate demoralising act of fighting their supposed comrades shattering all elements of ideological coherence, leaving the NRA as a shell of its former self.\n\nMost critical to the stability and continued perseverance of the government, the military high command has insisted urgently to [ROOT.GetLeader] that the military be brought under heel, lest it tear the nation asunder in its fury."
 GXC.endgame.202.a: "Our revolutionary shield falters!"

 GXC.endgame.203.t: "Chaos of the Economy"
 GXC.endgame.203.d: "The hammer has struck thrice. Not only stacking with the continued counter-revolutionary campaign waged against our government, but with the crumbling state of the National Revolutionary Army too, what was once relatively one of the stronger provincial economies within China — containing the Pearl of the South, Guangzhou — has but faltered to a shambling corpse, sluggish and in decline. Having served as the main centre for support and logistics for our developing government, the flow of trade through Guangdong, alongside the resources and manpower of Guangxi provided ample support to our burgeoning contingent of the National Revolutionary Army.\n\nDuring the civil war in the party, where comrade fought comrade in a struggle to fulfill the true dream of Dr. Sun, a large portion of national infrastructure and industry was savaged in the warfare, having seen extensive utilisation in the fighting. Likewise, after the conclusion of the bloodshed, many of the urban centers outwith our direct control transformed into hotbeds to wage resistance against [ROOT.GetLeader], drastically hampering their capability for economic productivity.\n\nWith central authority in shambles, banditry, violence and local warlords have started to flourish in the void left by our absense, with foreign investors fleeing the country due to the broad instability caused by governmental incompetence, all of this combines in conjunction to prevent the National Revolutionary Government's capability to enact its much revered welfare policy, Minsheng."
 GXC.endgame.203.a: "To think it would turn out like this..."

 GXC.endgame.204.t: "State of the Radical Opposition"
 GXC.endgame.204.d: "Following the political and societal aftermath of the Kuomintang Civil War, our burueacracy has been shattered along factional lines, with the once united Kuomintang committees and councils now barren, empty seats left by those who joined the Central Committee, or otherwise having been arrested for their ties to [CHI.GetLeader] and his cadres.\n\nAcross the party board, those associated with Song Qingling and the Provisional Action Committee, those within Wang Jingwei's Reorganised Comrades Association, the doting liberals under Sun Fo's Reconstruction Faction, and even the extremist radicals under the elusive China Revival Society have all been cast away into the depths by [ROOT.GetLeader], branded as counter-revolutionary traitors.\n\nAlbeit not all have fully turned their backs upon our government, for some of [ROOT.GetLeader]'s deputies having managed to secure concrete interest in being welcomed back into the political mainstream, an olive branch of peace to those whom are ultimately our misguided comrades. With their skillsets and expertise yielding particular benefit to the National Government, there is much to be gained from such an extension of mercy, however, the political battlefield is merciless and bloody, and none know this better than [ROOT.GetLeader], and so the option of being ruthless is always on the playing field."
 GXC.endgame.204.a: "We cannot leave the PAC at the wayside."

 GXC.endgame.205.t: "Fate of our Revolutionary Siblings"
 GXC.endgame.205.d: "Having been a primarily revolutionary force since its inception, the National Revolutionary Army has attracted a broad menagerie of revolutionary opinions and views, naturally combining this with fierce ideological priority and relentless ferocity has lead to a factionally charged army placing politics above the nation. Whilst this has yielded a force utterly unmatched on the battlefield, for they fight not just for personal salvation, but that of the nation itself, it has also led to the fraying of capable soldiers and commanders in times of political infighting, such as the recent civil war.\n\nNumerous bright lights of potential within the high command have found themselves on opposing sides to the national government, fracturing its capability to wage the revolutionary struggle. Whilst most are ideologically opposed to our government, refusing all offers of possible amnesty, there remain a key section of more amenable figures from across the political opposition, willing to put aside ideological differences in the name of serving the national government oncemore.\n\nWhilst their skillset and expertise would prove invaluable in the reconstruction of the NRA, it may also yield itself to political differences that [ROOT.GetLeader] and the party may not be privy towards, and so there always remains the option of promoting a new generation of subservient officers, devoted not just to the National Revolution, but also ideologically compliant with the new government."

 GXC.endgame.206.t: "Labour Through Reform"
 GXC.endgame.206.d: "Ostensibly the nation is fractured, infrastructure demolished, homes vacant or destroyed, and yet its people remain, ready and pliant to aid in the great reconstruction of China. Various proposals have been floated by those more inclined to authortiarianism within the party to enact a campaign of reconstruction, utilising the more than available pool of workers on state mandated projects aimed to revitalise the nation swiftly and efficiently.\n\nWhilst deemed a considerable breach of the inherent rights of the workers, a blatant abuse of governmental authority by many within the party, proponents of such ideas feverously defend the necessity of such drastic measures in these critically dire times.\n\nYet there continues to be even fiercer opposition from the moderates within our party, citing such ideas as being a complete abrogation of any of the ideals instilled within the party membership by Dr. Sun's Three Principles. Such infighting may lead to an even worsening governmental situation, although it appears to many observers that this is less an issue of national rejuvination, and more that of political positioning."
 GXC.endgame.206.a: "May they redeem the nation through their blood and sweat!"

 ##PPP Events (220-239)
 GXC.endgame.220.t: "Government for the Producing People"
 GXC.endgame.220.d: "When the dust settled, the Productive People's Party emerged as the sole victor of the Chinese Civil War. From relative obscurity, Chen Mingshu and his allies now have free reign to shape China as they see fit. Despite their betrayal of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang, Chen and the PPP have already begun to tie their legitimacy to Sun Yat-sen's legacy. In government-associated newspapers, links between PPP policy and Sun's three principles are emphasised, with it commonly being stated that the PPP only seek to Many moderate nationalists have begun to flock to the PPP banner, recognising that the new regime will not go away anytime soon.\n\nChen Gongbo himself met Chen Mingshu where the Lame General offered the RCA leader a pardon. Graciously accepting, Wang returned home to Foshan, retiring from politics for good. In an effort to strengthen the PPP's Kuomintang credentials, Song Qingling was offered the position of Chairwoman in the new revolutionary government, but rejected the offer on the grounds that Chen Mingshu had betrayed her late husband's legacy. Chen also offered the position to Hu Hanmin and Cai Yuanpei, both refusing as well. Not everyone in the former Kuomintang has followed Song's lead in shunning the new government, however.\n\nHuang Qixiang, one of Deng Yanda's close colleagues, accepted an offer to join the government's revolutionary government council, the highest government organ of policy creation. Chen Youren, another member of Song's camp, has become the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Chen Mingshu himself took the position of Minister of Interior in addition to the position of provisional Chairman, with his key ally Jiang Guangnai filling the role of economic commission director. The new government has promised to deliver critical aid to the peasants of China, and ensure prosperity for all."
 GXC.endgame.220.a: "The Lame General in charge? What a strange turn of events..."
 GXC.endgame.220.b: "And to only lead us to ruin..."

 GXC.endgame.221.t: "Harmonious Land Distribution"
 GXC.endgame.221.d: "Intellectuals have defined feudalism as the system in which the subsistence economy of China plays a dominant role in Chinese society. It is universally agreed among the party that the system of feudalism is one of the greatest injustices in China, with landlords forcing the peasantry to labour away with no gain. Although China's coastal urban centres have transitioned out of feudalism and entered capitalism, most of China still toils under the feudal system.\n\nMany in the PPP were born into feudalism, and thus are motivated to liberate their townsfolk from this oppressive system. With a Revolutionary Government of the Producing People finally established, the essential business of land reform may finally be conducted. Some leaders in the PPP believe that the government should redistribute all the land to the people equally, regardless of former status. The remnants of the Third Party as well as former RCA and PAC members who have emerged as the more socialist wing of the PPP have backed this course of action along with some additions of their own, seeking a more Sunist' approach, with some aspects of land to the tiller being enacted, which allows peasants to obtain their own land to till and that the government will take steps to eventually nationalise land gradually. However, more moderate members of the PPP believe in a far more moderated land reform. In their eyes, a more conservative approach to land reform would be far more likely to be met with success and avoid the potential consequences of the social unrest and chaos that could spring from more utopian measures."
 GXC.endgame.221.a: "Distribute the land fairly, regardless of class!"
 GXC.endgame.221.b: "A moderated land reform sounds promising!"

 GXC.endgame.222.t: "The United Front"
 GXC.endgame.222.d: "The new United Front consists of a much larger assortment of parties than the old Kuomintang-led one. The first two junior parties to the Productive People's Party were of course the Kuomintang and Chinese Syndicalist Party. PPP leadership welcomed Gu Mengyu into the fold as head of the RCA, with Wang having disappeared. Huang Qixiang's participation in the revolutionary government ensured that the PAC would be second to the PPP in prominence within the UF, while the LCS has been sidelined.\n\nWhile Chen Shaoyu denounced the United Front as a counter-revolutionary farce, Chen Duxiu has attempted to salvage CSP influence, working alongside Tan Pingshan's loyalists to promote socialist policies in the government. Feng Yuxiang also joined the United Front with his Guominjun organised into the National Revolutionary Party, aligning itself with the Kuomintang. While many are sceptical of Feng's commitment to the three principles and socialism, his help was welcomed by Gu Mengyu.\n\nIn addition to the former nationalist bloc, Chen Mingshu extended a hand to several liberal parties who were willing to cooperate with the Productive People's Party. Recognising Chen's movement to be far more moderate than the Kuomintang's socialist wing, Zhang Junmai accepted Chen's offer, making the CDL the 5th member of the United Front. Although the CDL would have preferred an immediate end to tutelage, they hope to make sure the fledgling republic does not fall to socialist vanguardism or revolutionary excess. To everyone's surprise, the YCP under Li Huang and Zeng Qi also accepted Chen's offer to join the United Front. Distrusted by all other parties except for perhaps the flexible NRP, the YCP hopes to ensure that the new government is does not lean too far into class struggle With this large assortment of partners, Chen Mingshu hopes to promote the democratic reputation of the PPP and showcase his commitment to a pluralist government."
 GXC.endgame.222.a: "Only time will see if Chen can wield this grand coalition..."
 GXC.endgame.222.b: "And to cooperate with the bourgeoisie!"

 GXC.endgame.223.t: "The End of the Reorganisation?"
 GXC.endgame.223.d: "Although Chen Mingshu and the Productive People's Party have promised a continuation of the revolutionary mission of the reorganised Kuomintang of 1924, many wonder if the Lame General truly intends to stick with such a course. It was the 1924 reorganisation which saw the reactionary tendencies of the Kuomintang culled, replaced with a disciplined democratic centralist party structure poised to sweep through China with the cleansing fire of revolution. Despite this, the party was not united in what the vision of a Nationalist China would look like.\n\nAlthough all members of the Kuomintang were committed to the idea of National Revolution and the necessary stage of tutelage, the party continued to suffer from the plague of factionalism. During his governorship of Guangdong, Chen Mingshu suppressed radical leftist elements, which has made him no shortage of enemies among both the RCA and the PAC.\n\nNow that Chen has emerged as a dark horse victor in the chaos of the preceding years, such a need for diplomacy is at its end. Many committed revolutionaries fear for the fate of Sun's dream and of the reorganisation of 1924. Under the leadership of Wang Jingwei, it was generally understood that the goals of the National Revolution were to achieve socialism and uplift the Chinese people. Under Chen however, many Kuomintang members doubt the Lame General's commitment to a socialist revolution, and some have even suggested that he seeks to overturn the Reorganisation itself.\n\nIndeed, many of the more liberal members of the New United Front have taken it upon themselves to petition Chen Mingshu to make a statement on the failures of Reorganisation, while much of the Kuomintang has demanded that he maintain the revolutionary course of the Guofu. Chen recognises that to denounce the Reorganisation would not greatly affect his government's policy whilst earning the respect of various liberal elements in his coalition, though he risks angering members of the KMT."
 GXC.endgame.223.a: "The New China has no need for the Reorganisation of 1924..."
 GXC.endgame.223.b: "The Reorganisation was a necessary for the establishment of this revolutionary state!"

 GXC.endgame.224.t: "Honouring our Military Heroes"
 GXC.endgame.224.d: "Just a few short years ago, our nation was pitifully divided between apathetic governments and self serving warlords. Thanks to the NRA and the 4th army of Guangdong, decades of infighting have been put to an end, and even the Century of Humiliation may finally be over. Chen Mingshu, Jiang Guangnai, Cai Tingkai, as well as many other 4th army officers who have led the military effort to liberate China have rightly been honoured as China's saviours in a time of unspeakable darkness.\n\nOf course, such military men should be rewarded for their heroism. The PPP has already begun drafting further rights and privileges for all veterans and serving men of the 4th Army, as well as soldiers' pensions for all veterans in general. The government has rightfully seen this as an opportunity to subtly promote its own image among the populace, and thus generate political momentum to push forward more of its own agenda. On top of that, keeping a loyal military that is well respected among the people will ensure the stability of the government for years to come."
 GXC.endgame.224.a: "We must honour these revolutionary heroes!"

 GXC.endgame.225.t: "The Democratic Inclination"
 GXC.endgame.225.d: "Chen Mingshu has often spoken of the need for a revolutionary government of the producing people, but many wonder what will become of democracy in this new China. It is no secret to anyone that the Kuomintang pushed for a one party state which would govern the state during a period of tutelage, and after an unspecified point of time would relinquish power and call forth elections when the people were educated on how to be good citizens in a democratic republic. Although Chen Mingshu and the PPP have made greater strides in courting liberal parties who were less amenable to the revolutionary socialist government of the old KMT, it is still the PPP who retains the true political power in the government.\n\nMany believe the new United Front to be nothing more than a PR tool for the PPP to prove its democratic intentions. Indeed, the government is still primarily composed of PPP members, 4th Army officers, former KMT members, and a small minority of liberal politicians. All democratic institutions developed since the founding of the new government have then been unsurprisingly unsteady, and there is little faith in actual democracy being implemented in the short term future. Despite democracy's future being in doubt, most Chinese are content with the current state of affairs, for the PPP earnestly pursues the betterment of the Chinese nation and all its citizens, a drastic improvement from the chaos of the warlord era and Zhili dominance."
 GXC.endgame.225.a: "You cannot have true democracy without the principle of Minsheng!"
 GXC.endgame.225.b: "Another tyrant draped in the cloak of revolution..."

 GXC.endgame.226.t: "The Revolution Saved"
 GXC.endgame.226.d: "The revolution is like an unhatched egg - the chances for it to break before the chick hatches are dangerously high, and so must be safeguarded with zeal and nurtured with care. The first revolution began with the Wuchang Uprising of 1911, which would culminate in the overthrow of the decadent Qing Dynasty and establish republican rule in China. However, the revolution was betrayed by the Beiyang government, and the nation was thrown into chaos.In 1924, the revolution was given new purpose in the first reorganisation of the KMT. However, the revolution was destroyed on the battlefield, trampled by the German jackboot and hunted down by opportunistic traitors.\n\nWhen the revolution once again seemed to be threatened by the very KMT which was meant to embody it, the PPP had to step in to ensure its survival. Where the old KMT would have eliminated the bourgeoisie and subversive elements in Chinese society, the PPP has taken the velvet glove approach, subordinating cooperative liberals and socialists into its movement. Yes, China may not be truly socialist, but neither has the revolution been subverted by liberal influences. The PPP remains true to itself, pursuing revolution by its own design to ensure common prosperity for the Chinese people. Where once corrupt imperialist collaborators dominated the middle kingdom, the Revolutionary Government of the Producing People seeks to undo all injustices done upon China.\n\nTutelage of the PPP is a necessary evil for the revolution, but it will not last forever. The Productive People's Party, much like its founder Chen Mingshu, has endured countless hardships and emerged all the stronger for it. Like China itself, Chen has been unfairly treated by those around him and denigrated for trying to secure a better future. No longer will Chen or China be subject to the unfair laws of fate, no longer will the Chinese Republic be unchained by imperialism and let it be known that it was Chen Mingshu who led us to this glorious future!"
 GXC.endgame.226.a: "Three cheers for the Lame General no more!"

 GXC.endgame.227.t: "Healing the Divisions of the 4th Army"
 GXC.endgame.227.d: "While all who serve the National Revolutionary Army share a cause in bringing true liberation to the Chinese people under Sanminzhuyi doctrine, the 4th Army remains unique among all the armies of the NRA. Composed of Cantonese officers, the 4th Army enjoys a level of fraternity that has stayed true regardless of the battle lines taken during the Chinese Civil War. It is true that Li Jishen, Zhang Fakui, and Xue Yue stayed with Wang Jingwei and the Nanjing Government while Chen Mingshu and Cai Tingkai realised the follies of the Central Executive Committee, but 4th Army brotherhood transcends such divisions.\n\nWas it not the 4th Army which stood true together in the mountains of MinGan for over a decade? Was it not the 4th Army united in revolutionary spirit which defended the Chinese people of Shanghai from the wrath of Imperialism? It was indeed the shared brotherhood of the 4th Army which saved China from its dark decade under Zhili and German domination, and who continued to serve in the 4th National Revolution. Zhang Fakui and Xue Yue remained stalwarts of maintaining the true interests of the National Revolution despite Wang Jingwei's misdirection of the Party in the service of self-aggrandisement, and Li Jishen led Whampoa with the dignity and honour such an institution deserved.\n\nIt was truly a tragedy that Chen Mingshu and the India Clique found themselves on opposite sides during the NingYue split, but both sides knew that their 4th Army brothers simply fought to redeem the National Revolution. With the age of brothers' wars at an end and an age of prosperity and equality yet awaiting China, it stands to reason that the 4th Army must continue to shepherd our healing nation, with all the sons of the 4th Army standing guard."

 GXC.endgame.240.t: "A Third Way in Red China"
 GXC.endgame.240.d: "With the ceasing of artillery fire, and the putting down of arms, the disastrous Chinese Civil War has finally come to a thundering halt. Once the Archon of two parties, and now the resounding leader of a revolutionary new third force within Chinese leftist politics, Tan Pingshan and his new Three People's Principles Comrades Federation have persevered. Whilst nominally considered outcasts from the beginning, Tan Pingshan and his allies have already pushed forward with an extension of \"quid pro quo\" towards the disparate members of the Provisional Action Committee, Central Committee, and Chinese Syndicalist Party, enticing those attracted towards Tan's eclectic brand of socialism, taking components from both the agrarian elements of the PAC, and the radical union-focused practices of the CSP.\n\nAlready, influential Kuomintang figures such as Zhang Bojun and Peng Zexiang have expressed open interest in flocking towards Tan Pingshan's camp, most notably however are detentes between Tan, Chen Gongbo, Deng Zhongxia and other industrial socialists, who's prior history together within the CSP suggests a reinvigorated partnership between the grouping, some reports even suggest that Chen has been offered the position of Chairman, albeit refused.\n\nWith his power insurmountable, and revolutionary fervour rebounding, the new government has promised that their new model of socialism will be articulated to ensure safety, prosperity and happiness for both the peasant and worker, in a perfect harmony."

 GXC.endgame.241.t: "Land Reform in the New China"
 GXC.endgame.241.d: "Forever a thorn in the side of any national Chinese government, the issue of the land has been an ever present figure within the Chinese leftist political sphere, defined by key ideologues within the Provisional Action Committee as a subsistence economic system in which it serves a dominant role in Chinese society. In such a system, the dominance of the landlords should've been no surprise, with their capacity to control both the land and labour which worked it, it allowed the gentry and landlords to amass unaccountable influence within the political battleground, leading to a monopoly of power. Whilst the more modernised coastal areas of China have entered a proto-capitalistic stage, the rural provinces of the interior still struggle and toil under this despotic feudalistic system, deemed a critical issue by [ROOT.GetLeader], it is up to his new Third Party to best devise the solution to the qualms of the Chinese peasant and worker.\n\nAs favoured by the more radical members of Tan Pingshan's flock, Chen Gongbo has suggested a radical land reform approach towards the landlord problem, with the government methodically passing various land laws that would enable the National Government to seize land lawfully, and radically redistribute it amongst its workers. In comparison, the more moderate orthodox followers underneath Tan Pingshan's wing advocate for the following of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's \"Land to the Tiller\", allowing peasantry to obtain their own land to till, and the nationalisation of said land will take place gradually, with the land of all those deemed to be abusing the peasantry to be seized. With such a process, the issue of land ownership will be solved without completely placing the government in subservience towards populism.\n\nIn the midst of finding his footing within socialist political thought, [ROOT.GetLeader] has provided his ear to both proposals, perhaps reflecting the double-sided coin that is his ideology, for whatever land reform programme is chosen may define the future of Chinese Syndicalism moving forward."
 GXC.endgame.241.a: "Full steam ahead with radical redistribution!"
 GXC.endgame.241.b: "A more measured approach retains its merits."

 GXC.endgame.242.t: "Redefining Chinese Syndicalism"
 GXC.endgame.242.d: "Following the resurgence of the Kuomintang in the fallout of the League War, the junior party in the United Front, the Chinese Syndicalist Party, has limped alongside their master under the foolish leadership of Chen Duxiu. With the Chinese workers and peasantry representing the true citizenry of China, they have yet again been lead astray by a false prophet, for the Chinese Syndicates intended to represent them merely answered either to the Kuomintang, or to Paris and London, no more than an extension of the Internationale's influence into the Chinese political battleground.\n\nWhilst forever grateful for the diligent work, and brave sacrifices made in man and material by his European comrades, [ROOT.GetLeader] has set forth on defining China's own brand of Syndicalism, for it is a country split along two faces, the capitalistic worker, and feudal peasant. The shortcomings of the Chinese Syndicalist Party and Kuomintang are on full display, rife with contradictions in their approach to the citizenry, and beholden to inapplicable ideals.\n\nWith such revelations, the Chinese syndicates and unions have reveled in their newfound true independence thanks to the Three People's Principles Comrades Federation, no longer reliant on the Kuomintang nor Internationale. However, the matter of defining Chinese Syndicalism is a far greater beast than it would seem, and [ROOT.GetLeader]'s party is at an evident crossroads, choosing between his revolutionary industrial socialist ties, emboldened by the likes of Chen Gongbo, Deng Zhongxia and the other Marxists, or his moderate agrarian ties linked with PAC figures such as Zhang Bojun, and other theorists like anarchist Liu Shifu."

Such advancements have even lead to leading PAC figures Song Qingling and Deng Yanda to come out in support of the new government, for reorienting the Chinese Revolutionary movement into that of a truly benevolent one."

 GXC.endgame.244.d: "In a bold new step for the Chinese Revolution, [ROOT.GetLeader] has decided to fully embrace his Marxist credidentials, pushing forward with the radical Syndicalist wing of his Third Party. Invigorated by the actions displayed by Deng Zhongxia in the struggle for power within the province, and broader civil war, [ROOT.GetLeader] has sought to establish a radically revolutionary interpretation of Syndicalism, focusing on the developing industrial unions within China.\n\nFocused entirely on the future annihilation of capitalism, a series of proposals have been drafted that would see the further establishment of urban unions in order further foster proletarian unity, alongside the encouragement of the peasantry to come together in a broad harmonious mass in order to transform the landlord dominated small-scale farming practices of current China into the large-scale proletarian farming of the future China. In particular, Tan has sought the alliance of the Machinery Workers Union, led by Li Dexuan and Zhu Jingli - one of Guangzhou's largest labour unions in order to solidfy the anarcho-syndicalist united front within China.\n\nFurther inspired by the writings of Chen Gongbo, the Three People's Principles Comrades Federation has set forth with a state capitalist programme focused entirely on mobilising the proletariat for the future class struggle. With the planned inundation of the Yellow Unions, the nationalisation of key industries such as railways and mining, alongside the nationalisation of foreign trade, many in the counter-revolutionary opposition have thrown accusations of totalitarianism towards [ROOT.GetLeader], however he has refused this slander, openly stating that the presence of him and his Third Party will ensure the equalised prosperity for all within China, and inevitable advance of socialism."

 GXC.endgame.245.d: "In a grand effort to eliminate corruption and perceived \"enemies of the state\" from the Chinese society and government, [ROOT.GetLeader] has embarked on the incredulously dubbed \"Three-anti and Five-anti\" campaigns. The \"Three-antis\" are directed at party members within his Third Party, former KMT and CSP members, alongside any and all bureaucratic officials who do not hold party membership of any of the prior three. This is in following the aims of purifying and securing the coherence of Tan's Three People's Principles Comrades Federation, following the recent influx of membership.\n\nFollowing onwards with the \"Five-antis\", they are focused on the elimination of private property within the nation, extracting funds from the private sector in order to support the Chinese workers, whilst also further restraining the power of the Chinese capitalist class.\n\nWith the creation of the latter campaign, a large flock of cadres and trained workers within key private sector industries have been tasked with the gathering of information on the business affairs of the capitalist class, and the expansion of an anti-capitalist propaganda campaign has begun to bring the boot down upon the perceived abusers of the working class.\n\nAlongside these campaigns, Deng Zhongxia has called for intellectuals to reform their thought, asking them to \"arm oneself with the thought of Syndicalism\", and to \"throw away the vulgar perspectives of individualism and liberalism, and the cultural thought of European-American reactionary bourgeoisie\"\n\nWith such radical initiatives taking place, many outside the governmental parties have levied numerous critiques of [ROOT.GetLeader]'s nigh-megalomaniac conduct, accusing him of merely using party officials, bureaucrats, capitalist and business owners as scapegoats to further cement the power of himself and his Third Party, yet try as they may, their cries fall on deaf ears."

Extending invitations to his old allies with the Provisional Action Committee, such as Song Qingling and Deng Yanda, a particularly shining light in the darkness has appeared on the radar of the TPPCF, that being CSP member Liu Shaoqi, known for his brave revolutionary work in the MinGan insurgency, and for a keen initiative to expand his party beyond its traditional urban proletariat powerbase.\n\nRenowned for his writings, Liu has published a series of articles advocating for the new national government to produce honest displays of land reform, through the method of implementing a reformed Land Reduction Tax in order to alleviate the economic inequality currently experienced between the Chinese proletariat and the land owners. Seeing a common consensus of agreement amongst both wings of his Third Party, [ROOT.GetLeader] has offered Liu Shaoqi full capacity in implementing such a programme, seeing it as the middle-ground between the ideals of his old Kuomintang and CSP allies, and the necessary medicine for the Chinese peasantry and workers."

 GXC.endgame.247.d: "In the national capital of [Root.capital.getcapitalvictorypointname], Chairman Tan gives a grandiose speech to initiate the commencement of the National People's Congress of [GetYear]. In attendance are a wide variety of those from Tan's party, anarcho-syndicalists, communists, members of the LCS, and, of course, the most provocative of union members of the League - those belonging to the Chinese Syndicalist Party.\n\nIn 1925, when the Chinese Nationalist Party aligned with the League of Chinese Syndicalists on the eve of the Northern Expedition, few would have expected that the fragile alliance between the revolutionary parties would succeed. Indeed, it was the failure of the Nanjing Government that had almost driven this cooperation to an end. But it was Tan who persisted and prevailed in the plight of the Chinese proletariat, the revolutionary worker who would not just resist the chains of the foreign imperialists but would march as one revolutionary vanguard in achieving the destruction of capitalism.\n\nFor the first time in Chinese history, the act of the strike and the will of the workers have been enshrined in a newly adopted national constitution - drafted by none other than Tan and his followers. The Chairman has ordered the implementation of vast reforms, seeking to improve the livelihood and well-being of the workers and the peasants. Across the country, in major industrial cities like Shanghai and Wuhan, committees and union membership among workers have risen dramatically.\n\nOf course, the future awaits to see what the Chinese worker will be able to achieve in the social revolution. Tan has pledged that the Chinese revolution must not just be limited to East Asia but that China must aid in the world's revolution against the destructive ways of capitalism. And so Tan looks on to the cheering assembly; he knows that through him - he can draft a course distinct from the demagogues of the CSP and the KMT, a new third way for China and the world to embrace at last."

They sought to create a public fourm dominated by rationality, a new educational system free from political forces, and the renovation of mass culture. This public fourm would initiate debates on controversial issues such as universal suffrage, gender equality in education, and the abolishment of Confucian worship. They made significant efforts to rennovate the local Cantonese culture including Cantonese opera (yueju) and Cantonese folk songs (Yueou), the two men even wrote a new drama \"Bilhai Lianxiang\" to reveal the absurdity of patriarchy and arranged marriages.\n\nWith Tan Pingshan back in charge, he has invited his former comrades within the so-called Guangdong Marxist faction, including Chen Gongbo - the formal vocal ideologue of the Kuomintang's Reorganised Comrades Association.

 GXC.endgame.260.t: "New Beginnings"
 GXC.endgame.260.d: "As the last remaining regiments of the former Nanjing Government offer their surrender, the new Chinese government is now controlled by Peng Pai and his followers, who have distances themselves from the former Kuomintang regime and tried to emphasise their own distinct identity. But they are hardly the only agrarians in China and as they have absorbed other populist movements, conflicts have grown.\n\nThe Chinese Peasants' Party of Sichuan calls for a modernisation of agriculture, seeing it as the true path to democracy and progress, but are also hesitant on embracing the more radical aspects of the Guangdong Peasant's Association. Instead they have clamored for fair prices for confiscated land and have rejected tactics of landlord intimidation. Their rivals in Sichuan, the Chinese Peasants' Liberal Party, have also been folded into Peng Pai's movement. While liberal in nature, their members have shown a greater incentive towards working with the new Chairman.\n\nThe left and centre of the Chinese political spectrum are not the only ones clamoring for rural reform. Raising a similar banner, right-wingers like Shen Dengyi (a prior socialist) and Liang Shuming of the Rural Reconstruction Association have also offered their services to the new government; finding the Chairman's ears to be particularly recepetive towards rural reform in health, education, and productivity. Given their conservative ideologies, it is likely - that while their voices may be heard; they may not necessarily be listened to."

 GXC.endgame.261.t: "The Land Revolution"
 GXC.endgame.261.d: "The rich earthly soil for which the Chinese farmer and peasant toils his entire livelihood is finally in the hands of the country's truly revolutionary proletariat. For years, the Guangdong Farmers Association, under the leadership of its bold and revolutionary orator Peng Pai, has associated the Chinese feudal land system with a system of imperialistic capitalism. Now, with the recent unification of the country following the people's victory against the bourgeois and corrupt Nanjing Government and their warlord allies - the issue of land has come to the forefront of Chinese politics.\n\nTo the new Chairman of the Chinese socialist republic, class struggle is an inevitable part - if not companion of the national revolution. To Chairman Peng, peasants were divided into four classes: landowning peasants, semi-landowning peasants, tenant-peasants, and the rural labourer. The enemies of the peasants were the warlords, bureaucrats, compradors, landlords, and reactionary intellectuals - while revolutionary intellectuals were seen as a revolutionary vanguard and allies to the proletariat.\n\nBut as the revolution has now reached its critical apex with the success of the peasantry over the bourgeois and counter-revolutionary Kuomintang; the question has also come whether the revolutionary should be led primarily by the peasantry or should the peasantry and working class work together in a new class alliance. While urban syndicalists have a far different scenario of revolution than the peasantry, with the new revolutionary government - working with allies such as the syndicalist Yang Yin can help bridge the gap between the syndicalist and agrarian revolution. An invitation to the elements of the CSP, would create a renewed united front but this time solely between the workers and peasants."

 GXC.endgame.261.b: "Together in Solidarity."

 GXC.endgame.262.t: "The Innocence of the Peasant"
 GXC.endgame.262.d: "True, many will acknowledge that the Chinese peasant is ignorant; he lacks more than just an understanding of the modern world - he even lacks the notion of Zhonghua. To many socialist intellectuals, the Chinese peasant is a class that needs to have its consciousness awakened - until then, there can be no hope for success in the national revolution.\n\nFrequent comparisons are drawn by peasant sympathisers such as Peng Pai and his followers in the Guangdong Farmers' Association between the levels of the proletariat within Chinese society - significant distinctions are drawn between the rural proletariat of the peasantry and the urban proletariat. Evil and darkness are associated with the cities; unbridled crime and moral degradation fester the dimly lit streets in cities like Shanghai, while in the rural cities, there is plentiful fresh air and happiness. According to intellectuals such as Yan Yangchu (James C. Yen), it is in the countryside where one might find the true \"surviving virtues of the Chinese people.\""
 GXC.endgame.262.a: "Truly, there are none like the common people!"

 GXC.endgame.263.t: "The Necessity of a Revolutionary Vanguard"
 GXC.endgame.263.d: "In acknowledging the histories of past rebellions in China, such as the Taiping Rebellion or the Boxer Rebellion, socialist intellectuals, and revolutionaries have dwelled upon both the success of the mass movement in rising against the tyranny of Western imperialism and their utter and catastrophic failures in the wake of reactionary suppression. To the Chinese socialists, especially those who see themselves as communists - peasants and workers must be unified in class and led by the revolutionary intellectuals to transform their consciousness.\n\nThe syndicalists believe that the workers must lead a worker-peasant alliance—that is, the unions—but in reality, there are hardly many organised workers within the party leadership of the Guangdong Farmers Association to lead a syndicalist revolution. Most of Peng Pai's highest cadre are intellectuals educated both in China and abroad who seek to bring their knowledge of Marxism, socialism, and revolution to the Chinese proletariat.\n\nIn leading Marxist theory, it is, of course - the revolutionary intellectuals who partake in this seemingly unequal relationship. The intellectual is to be the leader to guide the uneducated and abused peasant to revolutionary catharsis. In this precious time of revolutionary change, it is essential- that the Chinese people understand that questions and doubts must be silenced away in favour of obedience and loyalty to the cause. For it is the discipline of the Party, that shall help hinder confusion, disorganisation, and disagreement - and it is by following the one cohesive revolutionary vanguard that true democracy and love can exist once and for all."
 GXC.endgame.263.a: "The leader leads, the people follow."

 GXC.endgame.264.t: "Cult of the King of Peasants"
 GXC.endgame.264.d: "In their efforts to rally the peasantry of China, peasant sympathisers such as Peng Pai and Shen Dengyi have long encouraged urban intellectuals to eliminate the areas of differences between the urban and rural proletariat of the country. Chairman Peng has long instructed his followers to use colloquial language and to dress plainly, in the clothes of an ordinary peasant.\n\nDespite socialism's nominal distrust and hatred against what Marx called \"the opium of the people\", Peng Pai's followers have long been encouraged not to show any disrespect towards local gods and ancestor spirits. While the Chairman himself has said that this does not necessarily mean that China should \"capitulate to religious supersitition,\" - he has nonetheless encouraged political instructors and teachers to respect local superstitions and beliefs. In doing so, across the country - a cult of personality has seemingly arose with many peasants placing him as a deity alongside local village spirits; with many of them frequently referring to him as \"Peng Bodhisattva\" or the \"King of the Peasants.\" Given the Chairman's instrumental role in securing victory for the common people, his followers have only taken it upon himself to continue rallying and encouraging this new cult in China's new socialist chairman.\n\nPeng Pai may have come from a landowning family himself, but such knowledge is only familiar to those within his close inner circles or has dissipated into dangerous rumors. Many of the Chairman's followers, since his movement has grown strongly, have taken it upon themselves to rewrite his personal history and story; and instead have insisted since his birth - that Peng Pai has always been one with the laobaixing."
 GXC.endgame.264.a: "Let the people believe what they must..."

 GXC.endgame.265.t: "The Rural-Urban Divide"
 GXC.endgame.265.d: "The general argument in contemporary Chinese socialism addresses two main issues. The first issue is what determines the nature of rural China: production forces or production relations. Some scholars believe that according to Marxism, production forces form the base of a society and hence determine the nature of the production relations and the nature of society. Since many new agricultural methods, equipment, and technology have been imported into China since the industrial revolution - more and more of the rural peasantry have been reduced to wage labourers and are now engaging in what appears to be a capitalist society. As a result, China is an entirely capitalist country from its rural outreaches to its crowded urban centers; and as such; the foci of the revolution should be entirely focused on its rural centers.\n\nHowever, others especially within the Orthodox wing of the Chinese Syndicalist Party argue that China is not entirely capitalist - that production forces are important but not as decidedly significant as aspects such as the means of production. They see China as a feudal non-capitalist state and that it must be the workers and unions who are to guide the revolution to its next logical conclusion.\n\nBoth of these sides acknowledge that capitalism had permeated the urban economy of China, but the struggle rages on between socialists throughout the country; as to where to focus the goals and expressions of the social revolution. By leaning towards the side of the orthodox wing of the Chinese syndicalist party, Chairman Peng could see it as an advantage to reconcile with the trade unions of the cities and declare a fruitful relationship between the workers and the peasants."
 GXC.endgame.265.a: "In the fields of Haifeng, the revolution was born."
 GXC.endgame.265.b: "It is a revolution of both the workers and the peasants!"

 GXC.endgame.266.t: "The Village Unshackled"
 GXC.endgame.266.d: "In a small village in the middle of the Chinese heartland, the minute the school bell rings to signal the end of the day, a fifteen-year-old boy puts on his red scarf and rushes out the door along with the rest of his eager and enthusiastic classmates. A few years before, one could hardly fathom that a school would be available for the village children, as it had been for centuries - that in a poor village like theirs, the children would have played a role in the fields. But times have rapidly changed, and since then, the villagers' livelihood has seemingly altered dramatically for the better.\n\nHeading home, he arrives to help his mother out at the local commune's kitchen. Multiple families are able to gather at the commune's mess hall to share communal meals underneath a grandiose portrait of Comrade Peng. Following their meals, the local commune's commissar stirs its members in a fiery speech, praising the commune's weekly agricultural production and promising they will only triple the yields by the next month. The commissar praises the young man for his academic excellence and hard work in the field, earning him a brilliant citation.\n\nAs he wipes off the sweat from his brow, once he is back in the fields, he could not help but think of the whispers he had heard in the school that day, that one the teachers at his school, who has not returned to work in three weeks, with the school's principal declaring that he had merely taken leave to study the great works of Chairman Peng.\n\nHe shakes these thoughts aside, instead whispering a silent prayer of thanks to Peng Bodhisattva for his guidance in bringing peace to the local village. After all, they had seen in the past few years, endless strife and conflict, now, finally - there is peace, and the days of begging for scraps on the floor from the evil bourgeois landlords have long ended. He looks onwards towards the sun setting in the distance and smiles, knowing his true ambition is to be nothing more than a rustless screw for the Chairman's glorious revolutionary cause."

 ##UPC Dem Shared (300-329):
 GXC.endgame.300.t: "The Hour of Federal Democracy?"
 GXC.endgame.300.d: "Who would've thought that the lowly intellectual-led Federalist movement would've actually seen it through? Their ambitious plans for unification by the ballot, despite all reservations, was instead concluded through the sword, and yet their project is truly only beginning. There remains much work to be done, nonetheless, the Federalists have risen from the grave of the 1920s, and stepped forward to defiantly stand against both revolutionaries and warlords as the only true representatitve force of the masses. Ranging from Democratic Socialists to Confucian Scholars, their myriad of interpretations of the Federalist movement is equally as colourful and diverse.\n\nWith concerns over Federation, Confederation, the role of the province versus the role of the state, electoral infrastructure, the Frontier and its role to play, and even the international position of China on the world stage, undoubtedly the young republic has its hands full. Nonetheless, there is still striking progress to be made in no short order. With various provinces having already drafted their local constitutions, or are almost on the eve of concluding the drafting process, the time has finally arrived, as is ordained, for the United Provinces to draft their own national constitution.\n\nBringing together the brightest minds of the nation, and representatives from all provinces that are currently free from military occupation, the scene is similar to that of the ordeal of the Hunan Provincial Constitution. The bringing together of bright Federalist doctrinaires such as Zhang Junmai, Zhao Hengti, Tang Jiyao, Zhang Shizhao, Hu Shih, Huang Yanpei, and many others, all for the ultimate goal of the constitutional drafting process, has raised spirits, somewhat.\n\nBut there remains the ever looming presence that this is perhaps a peak overlooking a chasm; can the various allies that have been made along the way truly be trusted to relinquish their hold on power? Can the warlords be subdued long enough? And what of the revolutionaries, running amok?"
 GXC.endgame.300.a: "And so concludes the Zeitgest of the 1920s."

 GXC.endgame.301.t: "The Nationalisations of the Military"
 GXC.endgame.301.d: "Perhaps considered by the most ardent militarist and provincial autonomist as pooling the wool from beneath their eyes, the official announcement of the nationalisation of the military under the Central Government has been announced, and is already well under way. With control of the upper echelons of the military firmly under that of the Yue Army and its allies, there has been little any form of resistance can do to truly stop their integration into the Central Army. And yet that does not cease the simmering tensions from warlords and governors who fear the loss of their military power, but it is not a sudden conclusion either.\n\nAs what was generally held to be the fait accompli of the Grand Republican Alliance and the China Democratic League, the nationalisations of the military has long been a core doctrinal component of their democratic theories. Under the formation of the United Provinces, the armies of China would be reorganised into the National Defence Army, consisting of only four divisions. Under the command of the Ministry of War, the army will be solely responsible to the ministry for pay, supplies, and assignment of station areas, with the provinces exempt of any responsibility.\n\nWith enforced apoliticisaion of the army, nationalisation of the provincial forces, and the mandate of separation of powers between the civilian and military spheres, many believe wholeheartedly in the death knell of warlordism. And yet, equally there are those protesting most fiercely against the reduction of provincial rights. Zhao Hengti and the Hunan Federalists have led a thorough campaign against the process, insisting that each province absolutely must retain its own provincial force for defence, akin to that of the national guard in the United States."
 GXC.endgame.301.a: "The dichotomy between Nation and Province grows deeper."

 GXC.endgame.302.t: "Rebuilding from Devastation"
 GXC.endgame.302.d: "Suffice to say, the Chinese economy has never been particularly the strongest beast. Not even considering the international state, the Chinese market has long been an object of desire, but not for the benefit of its people. The masses have long been abused by colonial exploits to harvest China's natural resources and export them for the economic benefit of compradors and foreign businesses. Even worse, successive governments have hinged themselves upon frequent usage of foreign loans to stay afloat, or otherwise sold themselves to foreign partners. Combined with extensive militarisation, devastation from war, corruption, incessant taxation, and an assortment of numerous minor issues, it is a surprise that the nation has avoided complete abstract bankruptcy.\n\nAnd this was all before unification. With the conclusion of the military campaigns, and the beginning of encirclement campaigns, the national constitutional draft, and the hoisting of the provincial government, the economy has come crashing down upon the societal frenzy.\n\nForeign companies have begun to cash in their debts, with a certain level of uncertainty about whether or not the government can even pay fully. Inflation has skyrocketed due to blatant increases in military spending, a plethora of areas on the frontlines such as Dongbei have been annihilated in the warfare, and are further restricted due to military occupation. The already high taxation compounding with inflation has led to a thorough dearth in any financial projection, and in-order to survive many officials have turned to corruption to feed their families."
 GXC.endgame.302.a: "They have not even given us a moment to breathe!"

 GXC.endgame.303.t: "Our Founding Father's Failing Health"
 GXC.endgame.303.d: "Having already lived for quite a while on borrowed time, it has become evidently clear that the health of the Father of the Nation, Chen Jiongming, is far from stable. Whilst not living a particularly spartan or healthy life from the onset, Chen has experienced health scares before; during his time in Guangzhou in the early 30s. And for some time now, it has become an even more pressing issue. He has begun to delegate further and further duties to his staff such as Chen Yansheng, Chen Qiyou, Ma Yuhang, Huang Dingchen, Yan Xichun, and others. And they can do very little but watch as their leading figure, and friend, deteriorates in his position.\n\nWhilst not particularly old, Chen nonetheless has had to endure untold stress upon his physical body, leading the nation during wartime and before that in the 1920s, having to lead forces in the Warlord foray has compounded with his terrible immune system. And ultimately, the clock is up — announcing in confidence to a few of his confederates, he has flagged his intention to retire from politics altogether after the next elections.\n\nEvidently the news has spread like wildfire, and has contributed largely to the sense of political instability. Calls for a new constitution and new elections, only subdued by the force of personality of Chen, have intensified. A large portion of the fervour has been contributed by that of the young guard, whom have continously critiqued the state of Federal Democracy for lack of vigour; that their compromises and the incessant gradualism of the senior GRA and CDL leadership merely isn't enough."
 GXC.endgame.303.a: "You mean to say, we must do this without him?"

 GXC.endgame.304.t: "Calling New Elections?"
 GXC.endgame.304.d: "With the new Federal Constitution having been drafted and ratified, questions about the current government have swirled. [ROOT.GetLeader] was elected fairly recently, under the terms of the new constitution they are entitled to a four year term, one they have not served out yet. The [ROOT.GetRulingParty] has argued that having elections so soon would be destabilising and that they should be allowed to complete their term in full.\n\nThe opposition, eager for another chance at power, has called for immediate elections to be held in six months. Their proposal has quickly found support from the various third parties, especially those who would benefit from campaigning in areas recently liberated by the government. In particular, they have criticised the continued presence of legislators from non-liberated areas, who were often \"elected\" from exile groups if not flat out appointed by the President.\n\nPresident [ROOT.GetLeader], realising his bloc is outnumbered, has offered a compromise where he will serve out two remaining years of his tenure. He has also courted many legislators who are themselves facing tough re-elections, and appealed to others by calling on their sense of political fair play. Leading statesmen from across the national assembly have gathered in the Presidential Palace to discuss China's next course of action."

 GXC.endgame.310.t: "Dawn of a Federal Democracy?"
 GXC.endgame.310.d.base: "The Federalist Project has long been an idealistic movement built upon the practice of provincial autonomy, local democracy, and the insurance of stability in the international stage. As a result, it has taken on an incredibly arduous load of varied political ideologies and colourful characters. Anarchists, Democratic Socialists, Liberals, Conservatives, and even Autocrats or Warlords have taken up the mantle of the Provincialist project. With the announcing of his retirement, Chen Jiongming has left a large vacuum in the political sphere, not even merely amongst the Public Interest Party itself, but on the broad stage.\n\nParties have begun to scramble to fill the void left by the Father of the Republic, and all the while the economy enters perhaps its most tumultuous period yet. Even worse, it would appear that the Federalist Government has made the move to turn back on their promises of Federal Autonomy. Under the auspices of the President, there has been a mandated \"nationalisation\" of the military, forcefully disbanding provincial forces and integrating them into the \"National Defence Army\"."
 GXC.endgame.310.d.generic: "$GXC.endgame.310.d.base$\n\nWith the national constitution being drafted, and the expectation that the provinces follow suit, the Federalist movement has practically become one of the Guangzhou Mandate. Whilst the nation is healing from the War of Resistance, there nonetheless is the sense of urgency within [ROOT.GetLeader] and his inner circle that perhaps the time is ripe to stage their own claim to the nation. If we do not want to be relegated to the humiliating position of merely another Federal bureaucrat, then there is no better time than now to strike!"
 GXC.endgame.310.d.yunfed: "$GXC.endgame.310.d.base$\n\nAs has already been concluded within Yunnan, the various provinces have begun a rapid drafting, or formalisation, of their provincial autonomies in response to the call for the creation of a national constitution. And yet, such an arrangement has left the Master of the Eastern Continent behind! For all of our sacrifices for the movement, it would appear that \"President\" [UPC.GetLeader] aims to steal all of the credit! In conjunction with the nationalisation of provincial forces, they seem to desire the absolute reduction of any Yunnanese power within the national government!\n\nSurely this cannot stand? Can [ROOT.GetLeader] truly await his own effective political extradition? A hero of the nation, reduced to a mere bureaucrat and general? Cai E did not await such a sentence, and there is perhaps no better time than now to prove that the Kings of the Southwest can still be the saviours of the Republic!"
 GXC.endgame.310.d.hnnfed: "$GXC.endgame.310.d.base$\n\nHaving long held a resolute and resilient provincial constitution, perhaps even the most successful within the Federalist movement, the Hunan Federalist movement has always been that of provincial autonomy to the utmost. Differing itself from that of Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangdong, or the North, Zhao Hengti and Huang Yanpei pride themselves on the almost Confederate nature of their Federalism. But with the national constitutional drafting process under way, it would appear that Guangdong intends to dominate the show.\n\nSteering the nation away from provincial autonomy with their desire for nationalisation of the army, they have provoked only the most intense vitriol from the Hunan Federalist intellectual base. Certain officers within the command staff have offered the rather brazen idea of open rebellion, a last stand of defiance. But can Zhao Hengti really shed more blood, for some petty ideological difference? If we are to pursue this course... there is no better time than now."
 GXC.endgame.310.d.szcfed: "$GXC.endgame.310.d.base$\n\nIn essence, Xiong Kewu's Federalist movement has always been dramatically overshadowed by his contemporaries. They see him both as an ally, and as an enemy, perhaps an abject failure? A man torn between two worlds: Revolutionary, and Reformist. A man who's own naivety cost him his whole Kingdom, and he has never been able to reclaim his position, at least until recently. Enduring untold trauma and tribulations, and even being betrayed by Chen Jiongming at one point, to what extend does he truly owe the Guangdzhou Federalists his loyalty?\n\nWith their nationalisation of provincial forces, it would appear as the final straw to seclude Xiong to a merely provincial role, to merely that as another rank and file soldier. With the creation of a national constitution, and the ratifying response of the formalisation of Sichuan's own, Xiong and his Gang of Nine could perfectly fulfill the role of their Provincial Federal Autonomy Preparation Office, and bow out. But would this be right? To merely submit once more?"

 GXC.endgame.311.t: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] Rebellion"
 GXC.endgame.311.d.base: "Following the realisation of the Federalist dream of China and Chen Jiongming's subsequent retirement, the parties in China's new federalist democracy have begun to scramble for power and support across the country. Within regionalist sentiment lies a fear of growing government centralisation (especially following the mandated nationalisation of the military), corruption within the government ranks, and a fear of dominance from Cantonese political cliques. With [FROM.GetLeader]'s supporters willing to back their claims with arms, a civil war is likely underway.\n\nThe Central Government of course is expected to have a major advantage, controlling China's major cities and commanding international legitimacy (at least for now) which as given them greater access to loans as well as a larger tax and manpower base to draft an army. The centralised Federal Army however still holds many disloyal regionalists within its ranks. Furthermore, [FROM.GetAdjective] regionalists are confident in the abilities of their forces and expect that others will rise up against the tyrannical dictatorship of the Central Government. And China is no stranger to upsets. What both sides can agree on, however, is that they will not tolerate another warlord era."
 GXC.endgame.311.d.generic: "$GXC.endgame.311.d.base$\n\n[FROM.GetLeader] and the [FROM.GetRulingParty] have been loosely tied to the Federalist movement as of late, with independent but seemingly compatible roots. Their national ambitions coincided with the Federalist victory in the South, and rode its wave to unification. Now, however, with the Central Government attempt to assert its authority over its former allies, it seems that [FROM.GetNameDef] is simply unwilling to accept Federal domination."
 GXC.endgame.311.d.yunfed: "$GXC.endgame.311.d.base$\n\nYunnan, the Southwest bastion of Republicanism, has since the Xinhai Revolution emerged as one one of the primary holdouts of political exiles and hopefuls determined to realise the dream of the Chinese Republic. The past years have shown the development of a unique Federalist movement separate from Guangdong in the province, but it appears that years of growing tension and frustration has led to Yunnan denouncing the authority of the Central Government. Invoking that the social compact between the provinces in the Constitution has been violated, Yunnan has effectively seceded from the United Provinces of China and has marshalled its military forces in preparation to fight with the Central Army."

 GXC.endgame.320.t: "Chen Jiongming Retires"
 GXC.endgame.320.d: "With the conclusion of the nation's long awaited round of elections, and the final promulgation of the constitutional draft, the dawn has begun to set upon Chen Jiongming's legendary political career. A true son of Haifeng born to a local gentry family, Chen rose to meet every single challenge with determination and resolute belief. Trained to be a scholar, and with a learning as a lawyer, Chen would find himself a revolutionary general, politician, and hero, at least to those individuals not particularly close to Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Even in his twilight years, he continued to work diligently both for the Federalist cause, and that of Chinese democracy.\n\nFinally, it can truly be said that his hard work has paid off. Having completed his life's mission, Chen has begun to make amends with his retirement from the political arena, hoping to pass the reigns onto a new successor to carry the torch of Public Interest. Be it Chen Yansheng, Chen Qiyou, Ye Ju, Xiong Lue, or Ma Yuhang, every figure within the party admonishes the rather large shoes to fill, in the vacancy of the Father of the Nation. Hoping to spend his glory days with his five daughters and eight sons, many believe that the young Chen Dingyan could perhaps carry on the political willpower of the Chen family in the far off future.\n\nNonetheless, the President has one final duty that requires his utmost attention. Pruning himself before the camera, Chen would perform another historic moment in the history of China; the nation's first televised Presidential speech. Albeit the nature of such an event is bitter, with the general notion of an era coming to a close. Uttering poignant formalities about the Federal government, the rule of democracy, and the passing on of a torch to a new generation, Chen would take a brief moment to ponder...\n\nIn the chaotic flurry of thoughts that dance across his mind, one shined bright as day. What note shall his tenure as the people's leader end on? What final message does he want to convey?"

 GXC.endgame.321.t: "Chen Jiongming Passes Away"
 GXC.endgame.321.d: "A ricochet of sorrow has splattered across the nation today. The Father of the Federal Republic, and eternal leader of its politics has ultimately succumbed to the unstoppable tide of time and age — perhaps the only beast that could take down such a titanic figure of Chinese history. Revered across the nation, Chen Jiongming's humble retirement to Haifeng after the conclusion of his monumental tenure of leadership saw little activity in the interim. Mostly content to spend much needed time with his children, with the occasional invitation of friends to his humble abode, Chen remained largely aloof of national politics. Retirement is indeed retirement, and it is very so rarely as savoured for a statesmen that still carries the demonstrable respect of the majority of the nation.\n\nOccupying somewhat of an informal Presidential role despite all of his best wishes to retire, he has largely lived on startling borrowed time. In a moment of erstwhile weakness, it would appear that the great equaliser struck.\n\nComing down with an intense bout of typhoid fever, Chen's brittle body could hardly endure. Visiting Chen at the time, Ma Yuhang and Zhong Xiunan could only look on as Chen, in an erratic and bed-ridden state, could only utter apologies about leaving his family, and inaudible mentions of \"The Republic! The Republic!\". After his passing, the two men covered his body with the Five Races flag, and his funeral — first a private affair, before a national announcement and moment of silence — took place in the ensuing days.\n\nHis memorial record contained writings from his comrades such as Zhang Lucun and Chen Yansheng, others from public figures such as Bai Jianwu, or Wu Zhihui. Many came from the overseas Chinese, and in particular, one arrived from Huang Guizhi who praised Chen for his work in the feminist movement. Buried in Ziwei Hill in Huizhou, Chen resides forevermore in the city that saw the beginning and end of his lifelong struggle for a democratic republic."

 GXC.endgame.330.d: "At a reception in 1923 held by Beijing cultural circles in preparation for the visit of Tagore, Zhang locked eyes with Wang Shiying, a graduate from the Chinese Department of Beijing Women's Normal College and fell in love at first sight. There was something about her aside from her physical beauty that captivated Zhang. Shiying's intellect and wit, her ability to carry long winded political discussions, and her literary talent in prominent student magazines enamored Zhang who began a constant correspondence with the passionate student thirteen years his junior.\n\nDespite initially being hesitant with Zhang's pursuits, the two continued to grow closer and by 1925, Wang then accepted Zhang's proposal and the two were married. They would go on to have five children, with unfortunately the fifth child dying early in childhood due to sickness. As the now President Zhang spends his days locked in his office and with his cabinet, Wang Shiying has taken the responsibility of rearing the First Family herself.\n\nZhang's brother Gongquan, is a prominent banker fluent in French and the nature of Shanghai politics. Having worked in the banking industry for two decades, Gongquan has been rewarded a post in Zhang's cabinet - dictating the growing industrialisation of the Chinese nation.\n\nZhang's beloved sister, Youyi, has been close to the President since her youth when Junmai promised to take care of her after their mother lamented that no one would marry Youyi for refusing to bind her feet. After a brief stint in teaching German at Suzhou, she took over the management of the Shanghai Women's Commercial Savings Bank and saved it from near bankruptcy. After the restructuring, she opened a Clothing Company and engaged in stock trading in which she has become one of China's most successful businesswomen. Now with her brother as the President of China, she has taken a party post in managing the DSP's finances."

 GXC.endgame.331.t: "The Prime Minister's Musings"
 GXC.endgame.331.d: "As the new Prime Minister of China, Zhang Dongsun has also been busy, having recently published three articles describing his political views and understandings. Not surprisingly, they have been met to both acclaim from within the DSP and criticism from outside the Party.\n\n\"Thought and Society\" and \"Reason and Democracy\" combine sociology with epistemology, painting with broad strokes a canvas of intellectual curiosity in regards to a unique metanarrative. In these articles, he describes capitalism as an economic phenomenon and state of society but denounces it as an ideal. Rather capitalism was an instrument for growth and development, a necessary step in the Chinese Revolution but not particularly one that could truly liberate the Chinese people.\n\nIn \"Democracy and Socialism\", Zhang writes that socialism is an ideology and an ideal but unlike capitalism, traces its origins to Christianity. Socialism is hard-hearted Christianity and Christianity is soft hearted socialism, he writes. Indeed all social reforms trace themselves to a collective desire to find salvation, with Marxism being one of these possibilities to reach the spiritual liberation that will supersede capitalism. However, Zhang has shied away from class struggle, advocating peaceful reconstruction instead. This is after all where the Kuomintang revolution had failed. To be democratic was to be a Confucian moralist, driven by love and passion for all classes, races, and countries.\n\nFrom these principles, economic equality will be achieved not by redistribution or revolution, but by the increase of production. A society, driven by progress and aesthetics, will become a society where mind, nature, and cultivation reign supreme. Naturally, Zhang's writings have attracted criticism from conservatives and socialists alike. The Prime Minister has dismissed these critics, citing that his studies offer a comprehensive plan for national rebuilding. With Zhang Dongsun at the helm with Zhang Junmai, is there really anyone who can oppose them?"
 GXC.endgame.331.a: "An idealistic dreamer not yet confronted by reality."

 GXC.endgame.332.t: "New Thought for an Ancient Nation"
 GXC.endgame.332.d: "Now as the guiding hand of the nation, Zhang Junmai's background as an educator is proving to be effective as his cabinet plans out their policy on educating the future of the Chinese nation.\n\nZhang believes that education can be either \"direct\" or \"indirect\". Direct means of education refer to schools and universities while indirect means of education can be libraries, cinemas, musuems, theatres, and radios. Having studied the German model of education and some inspiration from the socialist French standards of education, Zhang Junmai has proposed vocational schooling for workers and labour academies for workers and peasants to help them possibly enter university (along with night and evening schools).\n\nHaving first been introduced like many others to socialism during the November 4th Movement, Zhang Dongsun has also been active in his promotion of socialism. The Prime Minister has given lectures at prominent universities such as Peking University and Tsinghua, where he has advocated for the country to adopt socialist principles. He has denounced the bloodthirsty revolution of the autocratic Kuomintang but rather has argued that socialism is a general direction of societal development that can be achieved by the classes of the world working in tandem. Step by step, brick by brick, socialism can be achieved by the will of the masses without the need of violent revolution but by the steel mills of growing industrialisation. As the people grow in wealth; they will naturally work together to ensure that the fruits of the good earth are shared with all."

 ##PIP Events (360-399):
 GXC.endgame.360.t: "The Rise of the Yue Clique"
 GXC.endgame.360.d: "As the Guangzhou government expanded to all corners of China, the petty divisions between regional factions have become less and less relevant as their new national government began to take shape. For better or worse, control over the central government has always given leaders a powerful centre of gravity to shape the nation to their liking, and emerging from [ROOT.GetLeader]'s administration is the so-called \"Yue Clique.\"\n\nThis Yue Clique, named after Guangdong where most of its core members originated from, is the legacy of Chen Jiongming's strongman rule. Chen throughout his decades long political career was able to bring many groups and institutions into his orbit, and though he has since retired from politics [ROOT.GetLeader] has assumed his place in this nexus of Cantonese political factions.\n\nThe Yue Clique, when united, wields tremendous power particularly in the Chinese south where the Federalist movement first took root. Chen Qiyou, Chen Yansheng, and Guang Wensen commanded the Public Interest Party's now enlarged political machine, which now dominates the Grand Republican Alliance and retains heavy influence over the party apparatus, the overseas Chinese community, and cross-party interactions.\n\nWithin the central government, Yue Army Clique veterans staff most of the military high command, with officers such as Ye Ju, Xiong Lue, and Yang Kunru promoting their protégés into positions of power. Thanks to [ROOT.GetLeader]'s control over the Presidency, the Yue Clique led by Ma Yuhang has similarly filled the bureaucracy with loyalists and opportunists from around China. The government also has the support of many major financial institutions, thanks to their ties to the merchants, gentry, and banks who crave the stability the central government can provide.\n\nWithin the Yue Clique, there is plenty of jockeying between the different factions. But for outsiders looking in, it can often feel as if they will always put their Clique's interests first."

 GXC.endgame.360.c: "The dominance of the Yue Clique breeds resentment..."

 GXC.endgame.361.t: "Art and Movies in China"
 GXC.endgame.361.d: "Ever since the 1920s, a particular fascination of the Public Interest Party - shared by many others in China - has been on cultural revival. While Confucianism, New Culture, and other high level topics remain heavily debated among Chinese intellectuals, there is broad support for reemphasising \"peacetime\" activities such as filmmaking and art.\n\nWhilst the filmmaking industry of China is largely dominated by Shanghai, crafting such epics such as \"Fate in Tears and Laughter\", Cantonese films have taken to particular national interest. Such releases such as \"A Small Circle\", \"Love is Dangerous\", and \"Army Dream\", have taken root. With Hongmen productions such as Golden Gate Girl, additionally receiving the spotlight.\n\nSimilarly, art shows were seen as part of the Guangdong government's \"social education\" for the people. A sign of both modernity and tradition, the national government under [ROOT.GetLeader] has invested in various artistic endowments, exhibitions and competitions. The government has attempted to promote a diverse selection of styles, including traditional Chinese and Western style art.\n\nOf particular note is the \"Liagnan School of Painting\", led by the three masters Gao Jianfu , Gao Qifeng and Chen Shuren. Inspired by Western art styles and the revolutionary dynamism of the Xinhai Revolution, they have sought to create art influenced by nature, integrating Chinese, Japanese, and Western techniques and styles. They founded art institutes such as the Chunshui Art Academy in Guangzhou and inspired other artists such as Zhao Shaoang , Li Xiongcai , Guan Shanyue , and Yang Shanshen. Along with Cantonese opera and Guangdong music, the Liagnan school is said to be among the \"Three Beauties of Liagnan.\""

 GXC.endgame.361.b: "Art and culture lifts our people to new heights."

 GXC.endgame.362.t: "The Work of Huang Qiang"
 GXC.endgame.362.d: "Huang Qiang, also known as Mo Jing, is a renaissance man of sorts - a swiss army knife for Chen Jiongming and the Yue Army. A Baoding Army Academy graduate, he participated in the Xinhai Revolution. Afterwards, he studied abroad in Europe before returning home to Guangzhou to serve under Chen Jiongming overseeing Customs.\n\nHe became a confidant of Chen, following him during his tour of the Yangtze valley. Chen selected him as his representative in negotiations including in discussions with Cantonese figures over various crises related to Lu Rongting and Sun Yat-sen. After Chen lost power in 1925, he served with the Kuomintang's National Revolutionary Army during the Northern Expedition as a staff officer in Fujian before rejoining Chen Jiongming as he hastily assembled Cantonese forces to oppose total Guangxi dominance over Liangguang.\n\nDuring the Zhili Decade, Huang worked in Qiongya island and the Leizhou Peninsula as a liaison, aiding in various construction and development projects. He also began his foray as a sociologist, publishing about his survey work in Qiongya. Huang then followed the Guangzhou government as it began its campaign of liberation, serving in various senior roles including stints as an governing executive of various cities and regions, a military commander in the Yue Army, and a representative in the constitutional convention.\n\nA senior advisor to the President but without a large personal following, he has carved out a niche as a sort of neutral figure in intra-Yue Clique politicking. He has sought a more meaningful position than being a glorified Presidential aid however. One proposed project is a nationwide survey of China, though he has also angled for the prestigious position of ambassador to France since he is fluent in the language owing to his childhood education in a French Catholic School and university education in Lyon. Both would remove him from [GXC.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and leave the President shorthanded however."

 GXC.endgame.362.c: "Your loyalty is appreciated and will be rewarded here at home."

 ##UPC Dem Epilogue Events (400-429):

 GXC.endgame.400.t: "True Democracy"
 GXC.endgame.400.d: "What is democracy, after all? Since the Xinhai Revolution, many have observed and perhaps even believed that the Chinese people were simply incapable of achieving democracy. That power derived from the people and for the people is but a distant dream masked by the reality of military power and autocracy.\n\nAlas, this myth has been defeated by the leadership of the Democratic Socialist Party who have led the coalition of idealists and democrats to a true national revoltuion. A revolution that is neither the so-called \"class struggle\" of the Marxists which merely drives chaos and anarchy nor is it a revolution that submits the will of a people to an all-powerful party-state. In realising the new future of China, the leaders of the DSP, President Zhang Junmai and Prime Minister Zhang Dongsun instead look back to the brilliant lectures of Liang Qichao. This future is created by the idea of a true National Democracy. There is merit to the concept of a guided dictatorship after all. Under National Democracy, while one party may remain dominant - the other parties are freely able to challenge and discuss politics with the potentiality of also rising to the top.\n\nNeither materialism nor western liberalism can achieve a Chinese National Democracy. The pecuiliar nature of this revolution understands and accepts that the helm of the nation must be guided from the top, by those of high moral caliber and fitness who have demonstrated an apetitude for fostering the growing democratic consciousness.\n\nCritics may ask how long will this arrangement last? The DSP has promised reform and change in due time but have also insisted that given the precarious situation of China's infant democracy; the soil of liberty must be watered with patience and understading until the plum blossom of liberty is ready to bloom. While neither the President nor his Prime Minister can fathom when that day comes, until then - their steady hand shall guide the nation..."
 GXC.endgame.400.a: "Let the DSP steer China into a greater future."

 GXC.endgame.401.t: "Winds of Compromise"
 GXC.endgame.401.d: "In the aftermath of Xinhai, the burgeoning republic was budding with a wave of idealistic enthusiasm. However, the first election would not be a triumph of liberty and progress, but a mockery of freedom when President Yuan Shikai assassinated the electoral winner, Song Jiaoren. This bloody affair determined how all of China's future transitions of power would occur from there on out, and the republic fell into chaos. However, the new republic has restored some level of idealism across the populace. The first election saw the party of the democratic revolution, the PIP, rewarded by the population.\n\nHowever, when their largest rival the DSP won the next elections, the Old Federalists stepped aside in favour of the DSP without a drop of blood. This peaceful transition of power has laid a promising start for the new republic, though the future is far from secure. Many still fear that either of the two large parties will eventually seize power and establish one party rule, and others are unhappy with the de facto two party system which has been entrenched. Despite this, many are still hopeful that things will still continue to improve, and the current level of democracy is already seen as an achievement.\n\nThe DSP, under the leadership of Zhang Junmai and Zhang Dongsun, have brought with them their campaign promises and goals to the halls of power. While the CDL is a coalition of democratic parties sharing certain goals, it is the Democratic Socialist Party which leads the flock, a fact well known to President Zhang. Zhang Junmai sets out to establish a social democratic state in the name of Liang Qichao and the image of the SPD. Zhang Dongsun hopes to establish his guild socialist utopian vision for China, and form the bourgeois gentleman class that will serve as China's political elite and stepping stone to a reformist socialist society. The Zhangs carry the expectations of their supporters and the responsibility to shepard the nation, and time will see if they will live up to their promises."

 GXC.endgame.402.t: "Building a Better Future"
 GXC.endgame.402.d: "In the aftermath of Xinhai, the burgeoning republic was budding with a wave of idealistic enthusiasm. However, the first election would not be a triumph of liberty and progress, but a mockery of freedom when President Yuan Shikai assassinated the electoral winner, Song Jiaoren. This bloody affair determined how all of China's future transitions of power would occur from there on out, and the republic fell into chaos. However, the new republic has restored some level of idealism across the populace. The first election saw Zhang Junmai and his CDL unseat the provisional government led by the PIP, a great upset.\n\nHowever, Zhang was not to remain president forever. The PIP won a great victory against the CDL in the second election of the republic, and President Zhang stepped aside for the winners. This peaceful transition of power has laid a promising start for the new republic, though the future is far from secure. Many still fear that either of the two large parties will eventually seize power and establish one party rule, and others are unhappy with the de facto two party system which has been entrenched. Despite this, many are still hopeful that things will still continue to improve, and the current level of democracy is already seen as an achievement.\n\nThe PIP, unlike the DSP, is not entirely driven by the vision of its founder Chen Jiongming. During Chen's rule of Guangdong, he made compromises to both his left and right, resulting in a coalition of conservative gentrymen and reformist socialists forming at his heel. While [ROOT.GetLeader] initially hoped to maintain this balance of power, the GRA's alliance with various establishment parties and federalists has largely only bolstered the PIP's rightward flank, and the party has become more and more recognised as the party of the establishment, with influence intertwined with local power brokers and the military. Regardless, the Chinese people are eager to see what an old war hero can do."
 GXC.endgame.402.a: "A Republic of Ebb and Flow."

 GXC.endgame.403.t: "The Party of Washington"
 GXC.endgame.403.d: "In many ways, the Chinese Federalist movement has long sought to emulate what the adventurous forbearers of the American Revolution advanced. The Public Interest Party, and its ever faithful guide Chen Jiongming, in the image of George Washington, has brought forward the long-held emancipation of the Chinese people from the wretched clutches of Beiyang despotism.\n\nNever acting so self-gratuitously so as to be self-serving, Chen forever worked to better the lives of the masses, to achieve perhaps the greatest political legacy in the modern era. In the absence of those who could not, Chen ultimately could, and defied all laws of convention. A pacifist and a general, an anarchist and a statesman, a revolutionary and a reformist, he is a man of many diametrics, and so too is his Public Interest Party.\n\nLeft under the devices of his long-standing secretary, the silent eminence Chen Qiyou, and the party-man Chen Yansheng, the PIP has in-effect fallen into a dilemma. Preaching democracy on one hand, they have nonetheless instituted the greatest political machine the nation has ever witnessed. Winning two elections back-to-back alongside strategic alliances with various Federalist warlords of the Southwest and immense influence in Overseas Chinese relations have allowed them to dominate on the societal scene.\n\nIn effect, they have become but a permanent institution of the republic as a whole; extensive control over government appointments, the application of connections within the military when necessary, and the ever looming cult of personality surrounding the \"Chinese Washington\", Chen Jiongming, have all contributed to what critics call a \"sham democracy\".\n\nThe opposition, whether they are remnants of the old order, or the CDL, are forced into kowtowing, and playing the PIP's game. And their allies in the GRA fare no better. Even if they were to somehow leave power, the mark of the Chinese Washington and his party is indelible."
 GXC.endgame.403.a: "Elections are free, but how fair, truly?"

 GXC.endgame.404.t: "The Cantonese Beiyang"
 GXC.endgame.404.d: "The history of the Chinese Republic can feel cyclical. A powerful strongman promising to bring peace and order, to implement a grand vision for the future, and to save the republic from itself seizes power. He rallies his soldiers, sweet talks the intelligentsia, curries favors with the elites and stirs up the commoners in his quest for power. Chen Jiongming and the Yue Clique were but the latest in a string of revolutionary generals stretching back to Yuan Shikai to walk this road.\n\nIt was Ye Ju's burden to carry on the final steps of Xinhai's Republican journey. Chen's (perhaps inadequate) successor has been able to leverage the former's cult of personality and his status as Chen's long-time, loyal right-hand man to take power and stabilise the failing republic. Though some bemoan the \"tragic\" circumstances of his predecessor's removal and his rise to power, no one can deny how effective President Ye has been in entrenching the influence of the Yue Clique.\n\nWhether it be in executive ministries, the national assembly, the military, provincial governments, or even overseas Chinese communities, the Yue Clique and their associates are a regular facet in contemporary Chinese politics. Whether they operate as the PIP, the GRA, or as\"patriotic independents\", they carry on the will of the President as he vows to defend the constitution at all costs, even if that cost may be China's fledgling federalist democracy. What can other parties do but try their best to be useful and scrape a niche orbiting the new Yue order?\n\nTo many, despite their fall to the southerners, the Beiyang Republic never died - it was merely replaced. Still, Chinese politics may be cyclical, but people still hold out hope things will get better all the same. Peace is never a bad thing, and it is the first step towards a better future, is it not?"

 ##Dem Back Sliding Events (430-459):
 GXC.endgame.430.t.zhang: "The Zhang Government Falls"
 GXC.endgame.430.t.chen: "The Chen Government Falls"
 GXC.endgame.430.d: "It was a long time coming. Maybe it was mostly [ROOT.GetLeader]'s fault, or maybe he just was not given enough time to make his vision a reality. Perhaps outside forces were to blame, or perhaps it was the compounding failures of the government. Some say the [ROOT.GetRulingParty] was moving too quickly, some say they were moving too slowly. Whatever the case, support for [UPC.GetSecondInCommand]'s ministry has finally bottomed out.\n\nWord of a vote of no confidence quickly made rounds in the National Assembly, and under pressure from the military the motion was quickly carried. Prime Minister [UPC.GetSecondInCommand] did what he could to scrape together votes to save his government, but by the end of the week he was out of a job along with the rest of his cabinet. Senior military officers from the Yue Army Clique pressed the President to nominate Ma Yuhang to replace him, but seeing the inevitable [ROOT.GetLeader] elected to resign in protest rather than continue to serve as a powerless puppet.\n\nAfter a few hours of deliberation, General Ye Ju was elected as the \"interim\" President along with Zhong Xiunan as his Vice President. As expected, Ma Yuhang was appointed Prime Minister and he along with his cabinet of fellow Yue Army veterans, non-partisan technocrats, and some PIP luminaries were speedily approved by the National Assembly.\n\nPlenty of leading intellectuals are incensed by the democratic backsliding, but there is little they can do at this point but make token protests. The massive rallies the ex-President and other idealists hoped would materialise never did as most had long accepted the fate of the republic and kept their heads down. The new government promises to restore stability to the republic and protect the constitution, but they too would be disappointed by the cold indifference of the general public."
 GXC.endgame.430.a: "Democracy in our federation has taken a mighty blow..."

 GXC.endgame.431.t: "The Yue Parliament"
 GXC.endgame.431.d: "With the constitutional convention coming to a close and most provincial constitutions have already been ratified, nation-wide elections for the national assembly have been called. A new parliament will be sworn in in six months, though all but the most stubborn of idealists recognise that the makeup of the Executive Branch will remain the same.\n\nThe incumbent, Ye Ju, faces no serious challengers for the Presidency, new constitution or not. He and his \"Yue Clique\" (some running on the PIP and/or GRA ballot, some running as independents) will easily sweep elections in most districts - coasting on Chen Jiongming's legacy. Whatever the intellectuals may think of it now, the fact is he has proven the effectiveness of a military backed strongman who can combine progressive, utopian messaging with leveraging establishment ties - something Ye Ju hopes to replicate in face of Chen's retirement.\n\nThe situation harkens back to the old Anhui Clique, where Duan Qirui combined a powerful military strongman, a thorough civilian apparatus in his Anfu Club and numerous other factions orbiting them to dominate both national and local politics. The Zhili and Fengtian cliques followed in their footsteps, legitimising their rule by placing their leaders directly in the Presidency and now apparently the Yue Clique are as well - fitting given the Anhui clique's participation in the early Federalist movement and the foundation of the GRA.\n\nResponses to the upcoming elections have been muted. The CDL is the least happy about the situation, and have vowed to field a competitive slate of candidates wherever they can. However, their most combative members have already seen their activities curtailed and most of their senior leadership have begun to self-censor their ranks. For the old Beiyang parties who are used to this state of affairs, the old game continues. They intend to weather the storm as they always have, holding onto their strongholds and working pragmatically with China's new overlords."

 ##UPC Auth Shared (500-529):
 GXC.endgame.500.t: "Triumph of the Yue Army"
 GXC.endgame.500.d: "As the bugles of victory sound, and the rank-and-file march every gloriously to their homes, many accolades must be lauded onto the Yue Army. Considered the primary component of the larger national army, they bore the brunt of the fighting and strategic decision making during the Unification Wars, and the Second Sino-Japanese War. With untold devastation wrought upon the nation, these brave fighters stood defiant, resisting the enemy, and protecting their homeland. Now as a young peace begins to settle across China, the Yue Army remains in wait, as the whole nation looks onwards to the constitutional convention held in [GXC.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].\n\nCirculating around the capital, there has been a gathering of delegates from all composite parties of the Grand Republican Alliance — namely constitutional scholars like Huang Yanpei, or Zhang Shizhao — alongside members from the China Democratic League — with notable attendants being Zhang Junmai, Zhang Lan and Shen Junru — and assorted Independents from the Constitutionalists, or the likes of Hu Shih. Gathering the nation's brights constitutional minds, it has been full of raucous debate around constitutional specifics, and minutiae. All the while, it has largely been presided over and dominated by Chen Jiongming and his inner circle.\n\nWhilst not strictly a constitutional matter, an all too familiar issue, at least for those with roots in the Tongmenghui, has been brought up yet again. Considerations of the national flag have been raised by more hardcore members of the Yue Clique, insisting that since it is the GRA that united the nation, it should receive due recompense with the PIP's party flag serving as the national flag. However such a notion has been fiercely contested by most other parties present, even by Chen Qiyou, all of whom insist that such a decision suggests that of the Kuomintang's Dangguo, instead of a Chinese Republic."

 GXC.endgame.500.b: "Hoist the Well-Field high!"

 GXC.endgame.501.t: "Fading Light"
 GXC.endgame.501.d: "As the nation recounts its losses, and works ever gradually towards the implementation of national Federalism, one would think that the President would bask in the glory, lead the nation onwards through this time of reconstruction. And yet, the image cast by Chen Jiongming is far from that of a victorious wartime hero. Present at many of the National Constitutional Convention meetings, many of those attending have noted Chen's extensive reliance upon his aides and close allies, alongside his rather frail and pale appearance. Far from resembling the ambitious and young utopian at the beginning of the Warlord Era, time has not been particularly kind to the Federalist leader.\n\nOf course, the President's confidants understand his gradual deterioration. Overworking, stress, a brief stint of exile, it has all compounded into his own morbid realisation: he is living on borrowed time. And yet there is so much work to do! The nation has hardly seen the implementation of the Federalist Project, let alone that of multi-partisan democracy! If he were to pass into the night without so much as fulfilling any of his goals, what legacy was he to leave? Father of the Nation yet ultimately an abject failure?\n\nHis opponents, perhaps sensing weakness or opportunity, have begun to pounce. Pointing out the hypocrisy in striving for a free and fair democracy, yet relying extensively upon the Yue Clique. They have begun to suggest Chen has merely replaced the Zhili with the Yue; ruling as Cao Kun did before him. However, belittling comments and snide remarks can hardly diminish a man of his stature. Undoubtedly, he still has a job to do. Democracy must come. If not the perfect ideal? Well at least something close enough."
 GXC.endgame.501.a: "The clock is ticking..."

 GXC.endgame.502.t: "Resistance Swells Nation-Wide"
 GXC.endgame.502.d_start: "Let alone opportunism from the political opposition, it would appear that even the masses and army can hardly be reigned in by the dying President anymore. The China Democratic League, ever insisting upon itself, has recently begun to expand rapidly in support nation-wide. Forming the Democratic Youth Society, they have in particular begun to target student groups in universities. Organised upon the principle of regional branch offices, their numbers have doubled from four into eight. Flooding with support from all strata of the nation, the various branches are led in some capacity by the prominent figures of the League.\n\nOf particular note is that of the leaders of the Southern Branch, Li Zhangda, and Li Boqiu. The former, a long-term revolutionary. An attendant of Sun Yat-sen, Li was there during the June 16th Incident, resolutely defending the Presidential Palace against the Yue Army. Following Liao Zhongkai between Paris and MinGan, he would ultimately be resolutely opposed to Wang Jingwei, insisting his \"leftism\" was but a sham. Li Boqiu, for his part, is another long-term revolutionary, a graduate of Whampoa, and a member of the Provisional Action Committee who recently joined the CDL.\n\nLet alone the CDL's expansion, even the once-reliable warlords have turned on the President; exhibiting resentment at nationalisation of the military."
 GXC.endgame.502.d_li: "$GXC.endgame.502.d_start$ Even worse, the Yue Clique itself has begun to falter. Many have begun to abandon Chen, with the further left members of the PIP turning to the recently ingratiated Li Jishen as their beacon of hope. With the absorbtion of other KMT defectors, they have begun to coalesce into a movement of their own, built upon Li Jishen and Li Zhangda's work with the CDL.\n\nReadily apparent is the growing sense of a nation-wide conspiracy against the current government, as the people have grown disenchanted both with Yue Authoritarianism, and Zhang Junmai's bootlicking. Li Jishen's honest, humble, and diligent character, in addition to his military accolades, has won him much support across KMT and CDL circles alike."
 GXC.endgame.502.d_noli: "$GXC.endgame.502.d_start$ Whilst not a particularly strong oppositional movement without a central figure, as most of the nation has grown tired of Zhang Junmai's blatant bootlicking, it still proves that a dubious sense of failure has begun to emerge within the Federalist project; crushed by the weight of necessity, or disillusionment. The PIP's left-wing have begun to abandon the party altogether, flocking to the CDL, and insurbordination within the ranks of the national army has developed extensively."
 GXC.endgame.502.a: "How quickly people turn on their heroes."

 GXC.endgame.503.t: "An Urgent Appeal"
 GXC.endgame.503.d: "Echoing all throughout the masses ears and the halls of the intellectuals and politicians has been the China Democratic League's most recent political salvo. An array of shells has made headlines in news articles, and has rapidly disseminated itself all throughout political life in the nation. Seeking freedom under the guarantee of civil liberties, and the freedoms of speech, press, assembly, organisation, travel, residence, and selection of vocation, it has largely been a statement of a general call for change.\n\nThe abolition of dominant party control, abolition of wartime measures and all regulations on speech and publication, a commission of inter-party cooperation to control the size of the military, a commission to adjust personnel in accordance with local conditions. And even a call for local Self-Government from the Province downwards to be strengthened, so as to achieve a balance between the Central and Local authorities, have all been found within the text.\n\nMost importantly however, has been the rather flagrant demand for an enforced coalition government with the CDL, which should run the country and supervise new elections for the National Assembly, and ultimately serve as a transitory regime leading to the inauguration of a fully representative constitutional government, albeit it remains aloof of the complexity of working out what such a coalition should constitute.\n\nServing largely as an olive branch to the Yue Clique, a positive government response could very well be the last chance for Chen Jiongming to embrace or reject the CDL's domineering position, albeit concerns have highlighted themselves within his inner circle. Public intellectual anger has been growing as of recent, and not a lot of people are willing to believe in either the GRA or the CDL. An even larger chunk of the masses are more akin to cattle, tired and ignorant. Even worse, the statement implies that Zhang Junmai intends to break from the current coalition, and demand a renegotiation."

Dashing through the headlines, it has been reported that the Guangxi provincial assembly has largely refused to ratify the Chen Jiongming Constitution. Having been the first province to be \"liberated\", it is also the most independent, having been rebuilt after its capture.\n\nThe two rival warlord factions within the province, led by Liu Zhenhuan and Lin Hu respectively, have joined forces to sink the proposed constitution, acting as perhaps the spark for a crescendo of failures to ratify the national constitution, which would in-turn sink the Constitutional Convention.\n\nThis is a culmination of Chen's once tacit allies turning their backs on him, as Liu Zhenhuan has worked with Tang Jiyao and Chen Jiongming in the 1920s, but as of recent has turned to the CDL. Lin Hu for his part, has served both as a rival, and an ally, but his influence in the mid 1930s turned the tide of the early Federalist revival in their favour. His dissent is without a doubt a sign of bad things to come.\n\nMotivated by a mixture of dislike for Chen's executive overreach as a betrayal of Federalism, envy at privileges granted to the Yue Army, and the nationalisation plan, their initiative has seen other provincial governments weigh a similar course of action. In conjunction, a lot of the non-Yue Army units that have been absorbed into the national army have begun to show their support for Guangxi.\n\nAs ever, speed is the name of the game, and Chen has decided resolutely to travel to Nanning with Chen Qiyou to negotiate. But Ye Ju has insisted that the President bring an armed guard for his own safety, albeit there is apprehension as too many armed men may be seen as a threat. Bickering has broken out amongst Chen's lieutenants, perhaps with some intention of securing their place after his death."

 GXC.endgame.510.d: "Tragedy has struck the Federal Republic! Whilst on his way to Nanning, Chen naturally cleared all checkpoints, but upon actually setting foot into the city, he and all of his entourage were seized by local officers. Ranging from lieutenants to even generals, the rebels managed to capture President and his inner-circle with minimal casualties, as most of the demoralised Yue Army surrendered after the first few shots. Placing immediate demands upon the President then and there, they mandated the firing of Ye Ju, Ma Yuhang, Zhong Xiunan, Chen Lianbo, and plenty others all of whom they blame for corruption in the government and military.\n\nMoving the President and his entourage to a secure location the coup has sent [UPC.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] into utter abject chaos! Lin Hu and Liu Zhenhuan for their part have announced their complete opposition to the plot, insisting that the plotters responsible are acting against their orders, albeit such claims are surely hard to believe.\n\nIn the capital, aides dash in-and-out of Marshal Ye Ju's office. Growing increasingly erratic as of the disclosure of the Incident, he has begun to seclude civilian Yue figures from deciding upon the government's response. Bordering on civil war, the Marshal has made orders to various Yue army units to swiftly march on Nanning whilst simultaneously dispatching army units to the CDL's headquarters in the capital with intent of seizing Zhang Junmai on charges of conspiracy and treason.\n\nYet they arrived too late to capture the troubadour. Fleeing the capital beforehand, he appears to have covered his tracks; the CDL having recently release a statement demanding a peaceful resolution. With the situation rapidly unfolding, the news of the President's abduction has further resulted in students and workers emerging in mass protests on the streets, loosely inspired by leftist and CDL ushering."

 GXC.endgame.511.t: "Li Jishen's Coup"
 GXC.endgame.511.d: "Seeing that only a military response could produce immediate results, at risk of Chen Jiongming's death in captivity, Marshal Ye Ju announced not only a state of martial law, but a formal march upon Nanning to liberate Chen. And yet it would not be opposition from the rebels themselves that halted his advance, but that of the Yue Clique itself. With many fearing that the military response would result in Chen's death anyway, multiple warlords and officers once thought to be loyal have utterly refused to follow Ye's commands, and the forces that did follow through were hopelessly repulsed by the Guangxi rebels.\n\nIn this moment of hesitancy, Li Jishen, rumoured to be at the centre of the Nation-Wide resistance movement, seized the initiative. Utilising the fury of the masses, disaffected Guangdong Army soldiers, and former revolutionaries such as Chen Jitang and Wei Bangping, Li managed to oust the incumbent PIP government in Guangzhou, immediately demanding negotiations. At news of not only political, but military failure, Marshal Ye Ju and the Yue Clique have all but fled into exile, like rats from a sinking ship.\n\nRising from a relatively moot role as a revolutionary guerilla leader to an odd duck surrounded by Federalists, and to an even grander role as head of a national rebellion, many have begun to question the role of Li Jishen as the figurative central figure of the Anti-Yue rebellion. Yet with an honesty and patriotism beyond reproach, numerous connections within Guangdong, Guangxi and across the political spectrum, and above all else, a pragmatic outlook, Li is perhaps the only man in the whole Federal army capable of such a role.\n\nTravelling to Nanning to negotiate with the captive Chen Jiongming, Nanning Warlords, and Zhang Junmai, Li deftly played each party against eachother. Brokering Chen's resignation and retirement as a broken man, Li has graciously \"accepted\" the post of interim President, and as head of the Government of National Reconstruction."

 GXC.endgame.512.d: "Perhaps the greatest intelligence operative of the whole Yue Army, Ge Zhaohuang has been flung into his element. A fairly late arrival to the KMT's NRA, Ge was able to defect to the Yue Army due to his connections to the Hongmen and Triad underground in Guangzhou. Rising through the ranks of the army as a man with a penchant for \"wet-work\". Thanks to his efforts, he has once again managed to uncover evidence of the true extent of the Anti-Government conspiracy — provincial governments, ambitious warlords, the CDL, and revolutionaries.\n\nMandating a meeting of the Assembly, Ye Ju, as the highest military official in the republic, formally announced the promulgation of martial law. Citing instability provoked by the national crisis and the abduction of the President, he has put himself into the executive seat, clearly not without a heavy weight upon his conscience. Placing Ma Yuhang as Prime Minister, and Zhong Xiunan as Vice-President, an apprehensive silence settled across the Assembly; perhaps vitriol would've emerged, if it were not for the armed personnel in attendance, and the CDL's absence.\n\nYet their response to the death of democracy mirrors that of the masses; accustomed to a low profile, they have remained silent. Either out of reverence for Chen Jiongming, fear of retribution, or plain indifference. Swiftly vacating the Assembly building, Ye Ju dispatched a flurry of messengers with orders: March on Nanning.\n\nThe assault on Nanning was bloody. With the liberation of the city from rebel control, Ye spent no time searching for the whereabouts of \"the boss\", and yet before him lay only a corpse. Having survived the assault, Chen Qiyou retold Jiongming's death during the assault, an incongruous accident. Clearly distressed, Ye wasted no time ordering the mass execution of multiple officers fingered to be involved in the plot, and further arrests of thousands tangentially related. Returning to the Assembly, he declared a new state of emergency, with news of the DSP fleeing intermixed with the CDL's ban."

 GXC.endgame.515.t: "The Nanning Negotiations"
 GXC.endgame.515.d: "Whilst few expected a peaceful resolution to the Nanning Incident, it would appear that they all underestimated the capacity of Chen Jiongming to evoke the best out of people. In his captivity, Chen's few scant meetings with Lin Hu and Liu Zhenhuan, in-part consolatory for the conditions and the course of the events unfolding, managed to pull some semblance of a bitter peace from the warlords. Pulling on their long-standing ties, the Father of the Nation has pulled through, defusing the Nanning situation.\n\nTaking the initiative as Ye Ju's Yue Army is placed on the sudden backfoot from the peaceful resolution, Chen Qiyou swiftly worked to negotiate a working arrangement with the CDL. Addressing their concerns about democracy and the future of the republic in regards to their Urgent Appeal, he has formally agreed to their terms of a National Unity Coalition Government for the next few years so as to support the democratic transition. As the foremost representative of the Public Interest Party, besides Chen Jiongming himself, Qiyou's agreement has seemed to calm the air for the CDL.\n\nWith promises to abide by the constitution and eventually see to more free and fair elections in the future, Ye Ju's armed response has all but been rebuked by the civilian element of the Yue Clique. Whilst not necessarily punished, upon Chen Jiongming, Qiyou, and Yansheng's return to the capital amidst Ye's plans for a martial law declaration, the Marshal had all due reason to regretfully bow out.\n\nSitting upon a broken throne, Chen Jiongming formally announced his resignation to the National Assembly not even a day later. Implying that he has simply become too exhausted to continue, the Father of the Nation has set about dividing his figurative empire amongst his subjects. Chen Qiyou shall become the new president, Huang Qiang, the Vice President, and Ma Yuhang, the Prime Minister. With promises of technocracy, many believe it'll be but more of the same."

 GXC.endgame.520.d.base: "The Federalist Project has long been an idealistic movement built upon the practice of provincial autonomy, local democracy, and the insurance of stability in the international stage. As a result, it has taken on an incredibly arduous load of varied political ideologies and colourful characters. Anarchists, Democratic Socialists, Liberals, Conservatives, and even Autocrats or Warlords have taken up the mantle of the Provincialist project. With the final unification of the nation under a coalition government, much of the masses' waning enthusiasm and exhilarating utopian idealism clashed with the brutal case of reality. Reaching a bubbling point, it had all but spilt over with the recent Nanning Insurrection.\n\nWith the promulgation of all Provincial Constitutions under Federalist Control, it was entirely unexpected that Guangxi, the first province \"liberated\" by Chen Jiongming, would be the first province to utterly refuse the national constitution. Warlords Lin Hu and Liu Zhenhuan, tenuous allies to Chen since the 1920s, absolutely insisted upon their opposition, drawing ire from plans to nationalise the military, executive overreach, and little implementation of democratic elections.\n\nIntent on negotiation, President Chen, his vice president, prime minister, and other aids travelled to Nanning to reach a settlement, yet would be seized and abducted by local officers as part of a mass nation-wide conspiracy against the government. With such a glaring sign of weakness, the Capital, effectively under autocratic control of Marshal Ye Ju, seems ready to pounce on Nanning. Yet this presents an opportunity."

Visited rarely only by close associates, Chen had been living out the rest of his days from the Nanning Incident in a rather abject state; broken, a shell, a dying man with a failing legacy. A utopian brutally crashing against the hard rocks of idealism, the only remaining spark in his life was the presence of his children, and the few visits of his close friends (Those that remained in the country, anyway).\n\nDying with little more than a splutter, it was reported that his last words in the presence of his friends and family were that of horror at leaving his children to grow without a father or mother, and that of leaving the nation. With his condition perhaps exasperated due to the Nanning Incident, increasing reliance on the executive during his tenure, and personal misery, Chen's funeral procession was largely a quiet event.\n\nDying within a year of reunification, it is perhaps symbolic of his legacy as a politician. And yet, one cannot forget the revolutionary hero that sparked so much change. For without Chen, the nation would have not had a hope at democracy at all, Guangdong and Fujian would certainly have been far worse off, and even with his reluctance to democratise damaging his legacy, his career was truly monumental.\n\nFor the Grand Republican Alliance and its supporters, Chen is a true hero. For the China Democratic League, resentment grows at the sparse mention of his name, for the Beiyang remnants he is beguiled, and admired. Whatever the case, his legacy is undoubtedly controversial.

 GXC.endgame.531.d: "Situated on the throne of quite an eccentric and eclectic coalition of parties, Li Jishen has found himself in quite a grand position, perhaps out of his aspirations. He never sought truly national leadership, yet here he is, herald of a new political movement and effectively de-facto dictator of the republic. With connections ranging from the criminal underground of Shanghai to the revolutionary furnaces of the Kuomintang, it has come to the President's attention that the elaborate house of cards erected in his stead has presented ample opportunity to push politics in a particular direction.\n\nConnected to the Public Interest Party through mutual Cantonese ties, the poarty has largely scattered without a true leader, as Chen Qiyou possesses little control of the party apparatus anymore. The PIP, and by extension the GRA, have voted to recognise Li Jishen as their Party Leader, on the orders of Chen Jiongming, pursuing some course of national unity. Albeit, obviously they're not particularly loyal, that is unless the President deigns to reward them.\n\nThe natural contenders, the CDL under Zhang Junmai and Zhang Dongsun are ostensibly alraedy well within the President's camp of loyalists, celebrating their great victory. But in-practice, the Two Zhangs have lost a large amount of their political prestige within the organisation, giving way to less than amicable allies of the President. Naturally, the DSP needs patronage jobs in order to maintain their strength in the CDL.\n\nFinally, and a fairly recent development, is that of the influx of Kuomintang defectors. Rallying around Chen Mingshu, they have formed the Productive People's Party. In practice, it is fairly weak, with the real power behind the front party being that of the illegal Kuomintang, who expect outright legalisation and for Li to return to their fold. Legalisation, is of course imminent, though whether or not Li welcomes them, or maintains his distance, is another question, one that could destabilise the republic."

 GXC.endgame.532.d: "Having grown apart since Zhang Junmai's increasingly authoritarian supporting stance, the Two Zhangs, Junmai and Zhang Dongsun, have seemingly reconciled a moderate amount. In a recent China Democratic League manifesto entitled \"A Declaration Regarding the Present Situation\", authored by a large amount of the CDL's leadership, including the Two Zhangs, it set forth the following demands for democracy: Freedom must be sought under the guarantee of civil liberties, free speech, press, assembly, organisation, travel, residence, and selection of vocation.\n\nFor Zhang Dongsun, democracy as a concept is that of a culture with characteristics that include politics in a broad sense. It is not merely a political method and a system of government but also, more importantly, a culture and a way of life based on reason and a constellation of values. Those being the values of Enlightenment, which could be introduced in society even in the absence of formal democratic institutions.\n\nLiberty and equality are naturally core values, with liberty being a positive and noble concept. Individual liberty was to mean \"growth, ready change when modification is required\", but it should not lead to actions that can harm others. There exists \"heavenly limits\" towards personal freedoms, that only through the exercise of self-restraint can those freedoms be prevented from degenerating into licentiousness. A notion of a \"natural balance\" exists between freedom and duty, natural in the sense of voluntary self-regulation as opposed to coercion.\n\nFreedom of thought and speech are basic and essential, any government in opposition to those principles is not democratic; democracy is \"government by free discussion\". On equality, it is merely the absence of inequality; those artificial privileges created for the enjoyment of some at the expense of others. To be equal was to remove those privileges through reasonable and democratic means, and a democratic system alone gave meaning to the principle of equal opportunity."

Whilst as Head of the National Reconstruction Government, he ostensibly serves as an impartial mediator, that is largely a mirage of smoke and mirros. For Li himself is a rather shrewd political operator of his own. Utilising his war hero credentials amongst the ranks of the Kuomintang, a large amount of his inner-circle are those of whom he worked with extensively in MinGan, but otherwise were stifled by the Party-State. Xie Wenbing, Li Zhangda, Li Minxin.\n\nFollowing him as he fled into the arms of the Federalists, their rapid rise in the ranks has been in-part due to their skills, and because of Li's personal ushering. But they're not all, Li Jishen has been a political operative and soldier for decades, and his familiarity with many individuals across the spectrum serves this reputation well. Attached to his personal clique is that of Wang Yaqiao and his Ax Gang, or better known as the \"King of Assassins\". There's even Chen Mingshu and his People's Productive Party, Lin Zhengxuan and the Political Science Clique, or his own son Li Peiwen, a CDL functionary.\n\nRather ambitiously, Li also has demonstrable ties to the practically defunct Old Guangxi Clique, having once been described as composing \"one third\" of the clique.

While Confucianism, New Culture, and other high level topics remain heavily debated among Chinese intellectuals, there is broad support for reemphasising \"peacetime\" activities such as athletics and art.\n\nEncouraging athletic meets and other competitions was part of Chen Jiongming's rule in Guangdong and continues to be encouraged by [ROOT.GetLeader]'s government. Even during the Warlord Era, China was able to send a delegation to the 1924 Olympics under the banner of the National Sports Association. Xiong Xiling, Zhang Boling, and others organised the Third National Games of the Republic of China in 1924, giving a small degree of unity in a divided nation. In Canton in particular, martial arts carries a sense of cultural pride; Kungfu is a Cantonese loan word, and the Ten Tigers of Canton are practically local legends.\n\nSimilarly, art shows were seen as part of the Guangdong government's \"social education\" for the people. A sign of both modernity and tradition, the national government under [ROOT.GetLeader] has invested in various artistic endowments, exhibitions and competitions. The government has attempted to promote a diverse selection of styles, including traditional Chinese and Western style art.\n\nOf particular note is the \"Liagnan School of Painting\", led by the three masters Gao Jianfu, Gao Qifeng and Chen Shuren. Inspired by Western art styles and the revolutionary dynamism of the Xinhai Revolution, they have sought to create art influenced by nature, integrating Chinese, Japanese, and Western techniques and styles.

Impounding the government in an immense corruption scandal, Ge Zhaohuang has been linked as a founding member of the Hongmen Zhongyihui Triad organisation.

But even that situation could not last. Pursuing a far more idiosyncratic direction, the ambitious \"impartial\" mediator of the National Reconstruction Government has instead steered his movement into a new direction, more tantamount to his past.\n\nWith the inclusion of the Two Zhangs and the Democratic Socialist Party ultimately rendering itself useless, Li's own personal support base of various national warlords, his own Guangdong Clique, and various Kuomintang defectors, and even the token leadership of the Grand Republican Alliance, have all assured him in his ousting of the Zhangs, with Li Zhangda all but couping the China Democratic League from underneath their feet.\n\nAs every major party remains under Li's tight control, he has effectively promulgated the national unity government just as the Zhangs proposed, but without them. Consolidating his role in the government, it has become evidently clear that the nation is heading towards a new form of Tutelage. Akin to the Kuomintang, but lacking the trappings of Dangguo. Not a National Revolution, but an Institutional one.\n\nTogether with Li Zhangda, the duo have ensured that the National Reconstruction Government is here to stay. Indefinitely. Focusing on the implementation of various social reforms, welfare, infrastructure, and the emancipation towards towards democracy, many expectingly look onwards to [UPC.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], yet see only the scuttering of technocrats, military officers, and high-brow intellectuals. A familiar but strange sight, it seems that a new revolutionary elite has supplanted that of the old."
 GXC.endgame.590.a: "A revolution, distilled by reformists."

 GXC.endgame.591.t: "Rule of the Renaissance Men"
 GXC.endgame.591.d: "Few believed that the role Chen Jiongming fulfilled in the Federal-Democratic Project could ever have been filled by that of another man, and so their doubts would be so swiftly dashed by the revolutionary hero turned President, Li Jishen, who has very well taken Chen's place. A military man and national figure at the helm of a broad unity government, Li's appointment of Zhang Dongsun as Prime Minister and Zhang Junmai as Vice-President would nominally suggest that of a China Democratic League government. And yet, the National Reconstruction Government serves to be more than the instrument of an elected office. It yearns to be the practitioner of democratic education, albeit in an entirely undemocratic manner.\n\nWhat does Democracy mean for the average peasant? Behold to their landlord, indebted with national strife? As evidenced by Zhang Junmai, any form of Anglo-American constitutional government is but an impossibility within China. The masses are apathetic, uneducated, unable to exercise their political rights. And even worse, the elites, those callous yet powerful cliques with holds on power would but simply manipulate the nation's elections.\n\nAnd so, the panacea to China's democratic woes presents itself: the enforced National Unity Government Coalition, presided by the \"impartial\" mediator Li Jishen, and encompassing every stratum of China to ensure checks and balances are maintained. A precarious situation, and a coalition only if the new Martial can maintain it, but it is perhaps the only way forward for Chinese democracy to eventually see the light of day.\n\n\"One cannot expect fast results, it may take ten, twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty years, but only then can one compare the advantages and disadvantages of the new system with the present old society and old system of government.\", as uttered by Vice-President Zhang Junmai at a recent conference. Democracy, not now, but democracy, in the future, that is what this government can attest to."
 GXC.endgame.591.a: "You cannot teach a man anything, you can only help him to find it in himself."

 GXC.endgame.592.t: "The Democratic Transition"
 GXC.endgame.592.d: "Slowly but surely, Chen Qiyou has settled into the Presidency. Though his Vice President, Prime Minister, and Cabinet were all effectively hand-selected by his predecessor, the so-called Yue Clique seem to be working mostly as cohesively as it did under Chen Jiongming. This latest national unity government has managed to stabilise its rule, ensuring the gradual transition towards a democratic, constitutionalist and Federalist republic laid out by its founder will not be disrupted.\n\nIn a speech before the National Assembly, Chen called upon the disparate parties to \"be of one mind and one heart, and warmly and firmly support the republic.\" He has pointed to the progress the Grand Republican Alliance has made leading the Chinese people to many proud achievements in building a federalist democracy, one never seen before in China's 5,000 year history and one that shall bring admiration around the world. Chen Jiongming's leadership allowed for \"long-term coexistence and mutual supervision\" that wisely \"fits the development of Chinese history.\"\n\nIn accordance with the promises Chen Jiongming in Nanning, Chen Qiyou vows to guarantee civil liberties and freedoms of speech, press, assembly, organisation, travel, residence, education, and selections of vocation. Wartime measures are to be rolled back and censorship and suppression of minor parties and groups abolished.\n\nHe concluded by saying that \"we must encourage each other, strengthen unity, strive for progress, connect with the masses, and do a good job. Since we have made many achievements in the past few years, we should give full play to this spirit in the future and contribute our best labour to the great cause of democracy.\"\n\nMany challenges still remain of course: many in China still hunger for a powerful leader like Chen Jiongming who can enact great change, while others thirst for the end of strongman rule and arbitrary decrees. Chen Qiyou can only hope he can live up to the legacy of his mentor, as a new day dawns."
 GXC.endgame.592.a: "Slowly we move towards Federalist Democracy."

 GXC.endgame.593.t: "The Rock of the Republic"
 GXC.endgame.593.d: "In calmer times, Chen Jiongming once wrote a personal poem to Ye Ju, a devout Buddhist. In it, he extolled his faithful general to \"put away your worries and enter the Zen heart, get rid of the disease and start chanting,\" while praising him highly, \"I remember that there were many talented generals...but you were the only one who stood out. You were able to read your father's books and stand out, and you inherited the family's teachings and maintained integrity.\" He ended the poem with a benediction: \"I hope you will be fatter and stronger than a plowing ox. I hope you will fight with your bare hands like a dragon and a snake on land, so as to refresh your spirit.\"\n\nChen Jiongming's spirit has departed the Earth, leaving his followers to carry on without him. For all his self-admitted flaws, he will be deeply missed by the nation he has saved and most of all his comrades and students whose lives he personally touched.\n\nAs his (to some unworthy) successor, Ye Ju has done what he has often done before - carried out the will of his superior officer, even as the latter faltered or failed to muster the courage to do what had to be done. Whether it be driving the Kuomintang out of Guangzhou in 1922, or leading the Yue Army into battle against the NRA in 1925, the General has always been the silent rock that the Guangzhou Federalists could rely upon to defend their republic. In the same way, their faithful Yue Army stood ready to defend their land from roving revolutionary bandits and tyrannical Beijing dictators and it will continue to do so as the Republic takes its next steps.\n\nFor now, a military-dominated emergency government remains at the reins. Like Chen Jiongming before him, Ye Ju envisions himself as the just arbiter between the various bickering factions in the assembly who will heroically guide the nation beyond partisan fighting. Some say the democratic dream died in Nanning, but to China's new President, the Federalist Republic has just begun."

 GXC.endgame.600.t: "A New Age Under Liangguang"
 GXC.endgame.600.d: "Finally, as so many aspiring Southern governments had desired, be they the Jingguojun's Military Affairs Council, the Constitutional Protection Government and its extraordinary congress, or even the Guangdong Federalists and Kuomintang Revolutionaries, the nation has been united by a Guangzhou led movement. And yet, ever present, is the looming sense that the real trials and tribulations have only started; but for now, a brief reprive, and a moment of joyous celebration. Many have begun to compare [ROOT.GetLeader] to some of the greats of Chinese history, which is undoubtedly fuel for the flames of self-indulgent nationalist propaganda.\n\nAlas, however, the North, despite having been united by fellows from the South who could conceivably be close and steadfast allies, has been most raucous in its refutation of Southern dominance. Even worse, the various regional and provincial warlords have begun to be an aspect of much debate and conversation within [GXC.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]'s halls, as discussions mount on the precipice of centralisation of the various Chinese armies, and the promulgation of a new Constitution.\n\nNonetheless, politics have begun to transition in the new, fresh, and revived Chinese Republic. With what once used to be glaring divisions amongst various local Liangguang political actors merely fading into the aether, as the nation glances to the Liangguang troubadours as a single, united entity, having bridged the gap between provincialism and national politics. And yet, they are simultaneously besieged by the old order, unkeen to be supplanted in their role within the nation by the troublemaking Southerners."
 GXC.endgame.600.a: "Unification, if we can keep it."

 GXC.endgame.601.t: "National Military Woes"
 GXC.endgame.601.d: "With the recent completion of Chinese unification, [ROOT.GetLeader] has gone to work in establishing a new centralised military. For the first time, an armed forces loyal to solely the Republic of China has truly been created and already eager bureaucrats within the military are at work in creating specialised branches such as a National Air Corps or in regards to the integration of military academies and arsenals. The new National Government desires a total unification of armed forces in terms of curriculum, traning, and doctrine from Shenyang to Kunming.\n\nAs such, local provincial and regional warlords have certainly found the new reforms to be challenging to say the least. Long since the collapse of central government authority following the Xinhai Revolution have local military leaders held on to regional blocs of power. Now, faced, with the reality of national unification - these warlords have filed serious complaints against the new central government. In more extreme cases, some warlords have even proclaimed the secession of their province and counties; refusing to adopt the new central government's military reforms.\n\nFurthermore, during the wars of unification and the subsequent war with the Empire of Japan; the Chinese army grew to extraordinary heights. Chronic shortages of well-equipped and well-trained soldiers led to the conscription of tens of thousands of men. Now with war finally over in China - the new central government is tasked with reducing the size and expenses of a burdensome armed forces."
 GXC.endgame.601.a: "Rebuilding will take some time."

 GXC.endgame.602.t: "The Struggling National Economy"
 GXC.endgame.602.d: "Since the declining fortunes of the Qing Dynasty, the economy of China has been in steep decline - with conditions exacerbated by the growing imperialist stranglehold of foreign trade dominance. While Western countries had initially sought China for its lucrative markets and resources; overtime increasing foreign trade domination through the unequal treaties led to a staggering national economy.\n\nFollowing Black Monday and the subsequent worldwide economic depression; the Chinese economy which had been so intrinsically tied to the German East Asian market - also faced greater collapse. As overspeculation and banks ran in the Legation Cities, the Chinese national economy only worsened and production levels have only begun to return to pre-depression levels. Local warlord regional economies focused primarily on fostering local industries with some warlords even openly selling opium as a means of generating revenue to fund their private militaries.\n\nYears of devastation from civil war and the war with Japan has left the economy in further tatters. Hyperinfliation and a national deficit has led to the weakness of the national currency especially as [ROOT.GetNameDef]'s government now is the national government. Large sectors of the country's agricultural and industrial sector lay in ruins and an arduous reconstruction process is needed in order to help China catch up wit the rest of the world. Banditry continues to remain a large problem especially within the rural countryside as the lack of government police infrastructure is not strong enough to combat well organised groups. Continuous issues of land reform and economic integration of the many provinces have consistently been pressed; with rural advocates and communities pressing for immediate relief and compromise with the recent unification."
 GXC.endgame.602.a: "Just make the stocks go up!"

 GXC.endgame.603.t: "A Developing Democracy?"
 GXC.endgame.603.d: "Many revolutionaries envisioned the modernisation of China to inevitably include the development of China from a monarchy to a republican or democratic government of some form. Revolutionaries looked to natural law, the writings of Locke and Montesquieu, and western countries - that had adopted democratic principles and experienced serious growth. To many, democracy is a necessary and inevitable byproduct of the Chinese revolution.\n\nThe past few decades in China have challenged this notion and world view. The subsequent return of the monarchy under Yuan Shikai was an utter mockery of the revolution that the martyrs of 1911 had fought for. While many governments openly claimed to be democratic or priortise the entry of democracy into China; it became clear to many that even the most revolutionary of the warlord era leaders such as Sun Yat-sen; gravitated closely towards authoritarianism.\n\nThe recent unification of the Republic of China under [ROOT.GetLeader] has resurrected national fears and doubts of the course of democracy. A lot of new government jobs in the growing national bureaucracy are staffed with loyalists under [ROOT.GetLeader] or are former Cantonese politicians/bureaucrats. At a local level, corruption continues to reign supreme with little central government oversight - chiefs and mayors are effectively running their own private fiefdoms undisturbed even with the unification of the country. Nepotism reigns supreme especially in regards to coveted military and political positions and crime continues to grow due to a lack of government infrastructure. Serious government reform is therefore needed to address the new national government and to strengthen local governments in order to better prepare them for democracy."

 #Endgame Rebellion Event
 GXC.endgame.610.t: "The NPA Dissolves"
 GXC.endgame.610.d.intro: "The National Protection Alliance is victorious, having successfully marched from Guangzhou to Beijing and toppled all their rivals before them. They have far exceeded the performance of its original iteration, which brought down Yuan Shikai's attempt at crowning himself Emperor but ultimately fell to infighting and failed to destroy Yuan's Beiyang Army in battle.\n\nThe victory of the NPA has catapulted [GXC.GetLeader] to great fame across the nation, allowing him to declare himself President of a reunited Republic. But though he is at the height of his power, the warlord is also experiencing a uniquely vulnerable moment shortly after his victory. Unification brings great expectations faster than it provides tools to handle them, and [GXC.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] is facing a raft of economic, military, and political challenges that leaves them open to a challenger.\n\nIn the long term, the provinces can expect centralisation and integration into the new order. Whatever allies they made along the way to unification are no longer needed; their uncontested control over the central army and government bureaucracy allows them to rule without them. This leaves both sides in a perilous position as both wait to see who will betray the other."
 GXC.endgame.610.d.yunlong: "$GXC.endgame.610.d.intro$\n\nFor Long Yun, unification brings conflicting feelings. It surely satisfies the nationalism within Yunnan but there are lingering concerns that sooner or later the central government will begin to infringe on Kunming's autonomy.

 GXC.endgame.610.d.yunhu: "$GXC.endgame.610.d.intro$\n\nFor Hu Ruoyu, unification brings conflicting feelings. It surely satisfies the nationalism within Yunnan but there are lingering concerns that sooner or later the central government will begin to infringe on Kunming's autonomy.

 GXC.endgame.610.d.shxyan: "$GXC.endgame.610.d.intro$\n\nFor Yan Xishan, this is a moment he has been waiting for for some time now. His rivals in the north now quashed, he can capitalise on Beiyang fears of southern domination to advance his own goals of national leadership. This may finally be his long-awaited chance to announce his own ambitions of national leadership."
 GXC.endgame.610.d.generic: "$GXC.endgame.610.d.intro$\n\nNo doubt our odds are long, but they will not grow any shorter by waiting. If we have any doubts about [GXC.GetLeader]'s leadership, now is the time to strike."

 GXC.endgame.610.b: "We willingly go from allies to subjects...for now at least."

 GXC.endgame.611.t: "An Alliance in Tatters"
 GXC.endgame.611.d.intro: "The unification of China was a joyous moment, but behind closed doors it was also a treacherous one. Victory pushed [GXC.GetLeader] directly into the national spotlight, something that was bound to draw the jealousy and ire of his erstwhile allies. It has also thrust onto him tremendous expectations, which his government has scrambled to meet as they sort through various military, economic, and political challenges.\n\nFearing the inevitable centralisation of the country, [FROM.GetLeader] and his [FROM.GetName] have refused to go from allies to subject. Denouncing the President they had helped install not a year ago, they have announced their desire to fight a new war to protect the nation. It would seem like a long shot, but they are striking in a uniquely vulnerable moment for [GXC.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] - a troubled government already beset by post-unification difficulties."
 GXC.endgame.611.d.yunlong: "$GXC.endgame.611.d.intro$\n\nFor Long Yun, this is a much bolder play than anyone would have expected. Known for his insular, almost isolationist rule, striking outside of his traditional territory in the southwest is a risky gamble.

 GXC.endgame.611.d.yunhu: "$GXC.endgame.611.d.intro$\n\nFor Hu Ruoyu, this is a bold play. He has spent years clawing his way into power in Yunnan, something he may easily lose in such a desperate gamble.

 GXC.endgame.611.d.shxyan: "$GXC.endgame.611.d.intro$\n\nFor Yan Xishan, this is a reflection of his sheer ambition.

 GXC.endgame.630.t: "To Rule a Nation"
 GXC.endgame.630.d: "With his victory in China's wars of unification, President Lu Yuguang's position in China's new order has been sealed in blood. He has dispatched the last of his enemies in battle, driving out rival contenders for power and putting down any rebels that dared to challenge him. And with that, he has become the face of national unification - there remain dissenters but uncontested power has this tendency to smoothen out the rougher edges of a leader's image.\n\nWith that power comes the need to demonstrate leadership for the long fragmented nation. The President needs to set a long term direction for his regime, and it begins with his selection of Prime Minister. With confirmation at this point merely a formality, many would expect General Ma Ji to be the natural choice: an experienced general with Zhili connections and the pillar of the Young Guangxi Faction. Selecting him would indicate the desire of the Guangxi Warlords to replicate the Zhili system, supplanting Cao Kun and Wu Peifu with a new strongman junta that the rest of the republic will orbit around. But despite their ostensibly close alliance, Lu may have some reservations as well - Ma may be powerful enough to eclipse him already and many see him as an old guard choice.\n\nThere are many who have called for change in the name of the \"Southern Spirit\": now that the corrupt Beiyang Regime has been toppled, it would only be right for the new government to transition towards civilian rule. Ma Junwu, the long-time educator and old Tongmenghui revolutionary affiliated with the Guangxi cliques may fit this mold the best. Arrogant, conceited but respected by many for his work as a writer, industrialist, and teacher, he humbly claims to be uninterested in politics and prefers his books and poetry. But few expect him to turn down an offer for the Prime Ministership."

 GXC.endgame.631.t: "The Guangzhou Conservatory of Music"
 GXC.endgame.631.d: "After the dissolution of imperial China in 1911, the Chinese people felt the imminent need to strengthen and revitalise traditional Chinese culture. Musicians began to organise large ensembles of traditional Chinese instruments such as the bowed string “euhu”, the plucked string “zheng” and “pipa”, blown wind instruments such as the “dizi”, and many others. At the same time however, they also brought in western instruments and began organising sections akin to their European orchestral equivalents.\n\nXian Xianghai is one of these new innovative composers hailing from Portuguese Macau to Tanka parents from Guangdong. As his father died early in his childhood, Xian followed his mother around and eventually immigrated to Singapore where he enrolled in Yangzheng Primary School which was his first foray into musical education. He was later brought to Guangzhou for future education where he began learning clarinet in addition to classical music theory. After studying for two years in Singapore from 1924-1926, Xian went to the National Institute of Music at Peking University and then the National Shanghai Conservatory of Music to study violin and piano.\n\nXiang has become quick friends with another Cantonese musician; Ma Sicong. The son of Ma Yuhang (the confidant of Chen Jiongming), Ma Sicong picked up both the piano and the yueqin in his youth. After falling in love with the violin, Ma Sicong traveled to France where he studied at the Conservatoire de Paris. There, he met Xian Xianghai and along with his colleague Chen Hong, established the Guangzhou Conservatory of Music; Guangzhou's first private music school. Priding itself as the first in Southern China to train and educate at the highest level both Chinese and Western music; composers have particularly focused on nationalist and cultural themes - emphasising China's rich historical traditions with the elegance of modernity."
 GXC.endgame.631.a: "The Chinese cultural scene grows!"

 GXC.endgame.632.t: "The Marshal and the FCDP"
 GXC.endgame.632.d: "When the National Protection Alliance was founded, it brought together warlords and intellectuals alike to resist the tyranny of Yuan Shikai. Lu Rongting built his cult of personality around being a man of the people, casting himself as a Robin Hood-esque figure leading a revolt against a wicked monarch. Though plenty saw him instead as a brutal warlord, his legacy has been greatly improved by the success of his son who hopes to capture that same Xinhai Spirit.\n\nLu Yuguang faces a much different republic than his father did. The Xinhai Revolution was growing cynical even in its first decade. An entire generation has since suffered war and authoritarianism under multiple regimes. The Republic has reunited, first under the Zhili and now under the Young Guangxi Faction. But the unification of the nation has also brought the unification of the opposition.\n\nThe Federation of Chinese Democratic Parties has advocated for a parliamentary form of government, arguing for the limitations of executive power and the creation of a coalition government representing all parties. It has also demanded the legalisation of all political parties, the guarantee of civil liberties, the abolishment of the secret police and penal labour camps, transparency in government, and fairness in hiring. They have coined the motto \"Democratic Unification and Peaceful Reconstruction,\" tapping into deeper frustrations over decades of mismanagement and authoritarianism.\n\nThe FCDP is ultimately powerless to actually enforce its demands. They were a useful tool in legitimising our takeover, but our goals have once again diverged. But that powerlessness also gives them effectively free rein to demand what they wish, with no one expecting them to make good on it. They can organise protests and write criticisms, but that is meaningless with few or no remaining warlords to oppose us. There might be good in offering them some concessions, but ultimately it is clear who truly holds power in China."

###NPA CMC Ending Events (660-689):
 GXC.endgame.660.t: "Last Outing For Democracy"
 GXC.endgame.660.d: "Despite their stewardship of Chinese Unification, few could try call themselves keen allies, or friends, of the Association of All Classes to Save Guangdong, or of the Merchants, or of the businessmen and industrialists. And even amongst those groups, few look fondly to Chen Lianbo, with his arrogance and incessant ambition. Constructing his own government, hardly comparable to most others within China, Chen has looked towards his roots in Guangzhou, and Hong Kong, seeking to institute what publicists have referred to as \"Cantonese Style Democracy\". Highly elitist, votes matter, but the voting participants are pretty much exclusively the wealthy and well-connected. Whilst ostensibly not too far from the democracy of Beiyang, the Old Republic at least carried with it the nominal pretences of free, fair, and equal elections, even if that wasn't the case in practice, it is still a significant step up, by almost codifying rule of the elite.\n\nBy significantly tightening the voting pool for elected representatives, those elected to the Assembly and Senate, who then vote for the President, are by far the old establishmentarians, and some of the new elites ushered by Chen. But for all of their grandeur, the Merchant's own sensibilites may be their own folly. With blatant favouritism to the South of the nation, and through the machinations of the Political Science Clique, a considerably developed loose alliance of figures have aligned to oppose the Merchants.\n\nRallying under the banner of War Hero Liu Zhenhuan, who's ambitions in Guangxi have made him short of a rival for Chen, Liu has managed to bring forward a motley crew of warlords, members of the Federation of Chinese Democratic Parties, and even occasional ex-revolutionaries to his cause. Running with Lin Zhengxuan as his candidate for Prime Minister, albeit unofficial until confirmed in office, the duo have managed to orchestrate an arrangement with other PSC figures such as Huang Fu, or Gu Zhongxiu, for affirmation of their roles in the cabinet, in-exchange for Clique unity."

While ironically placed in the traditionally lower echelons of Chinese society; the increasingly globalised and an industrial world birthed a rich gentry that profited off shipments of tea, opium, and other riches from the East.\n\nAmong one of these Cantonese businessmen came none other than Jiang Kongyin. Born in 1864, Jiang saw an early political rise under Kang Youwei. After passing his imperial examinations, he was appointed to a position of management for rural relief; where he worked to suppress bandits. During his time in government management, he also held sympathies for the revolutionary movement, he improved local fruit varieties, built a small gauge railway from Nangang District to Luogangwei, and began several weather conservancy projects.\n\nDespite his imperial alignment, he has also demonstrated sympathies with Cantonese revolutionaries - working with Wang Jingwei, Chen Jinghua, and meeting with Sun Yat-sen following the failure of the Second Guangzhou Expedition. When confronted with the reality of the Xinhai Revolution and end of the Qing monarchy, Jiang helped convince Liangguang's Governor-General and the Admiral of the Navy to express their support for the revolutionary movement and secede from the Qing.\n\nJiang is also famous for his gourmet foods known as the Taishi Recipes. Leading military and civilian elites in Guangzhou would come to his mansion to try them out, of which the Taishi Five Snake Soup is the most famous. Now in his old age having witnessed the late Qing Dynasty, the Early Republic, the Warlords of Guangdong, and now national unification - Jiang spends his days in retirement either cooking or performing calligraphy."

Of ties to the British, or tangentially to the Japanese, or the Germans. And it is true, that President [ROOT.GetLeader] fondly looks towards the industrialised nations, but not to sell out China. But instead, as a model of state governance to emulate. Bismarckian Germany, Meiji Japan, the rule of the Whigs in Britain, or in the United States. All states, and all parties, have had their fair share of success stories, and of troubling controversies, but all have been the stewards of Great Powers, able to exert themselves with confidence in economic and military affairs. And it is to these states and parties, that factions have emerged within the Assembly, Senate, and even Cabinet, of the direction, or the model, upon which the President and his loyal men should follow.\n\nOn one side, an increasingly developing group of officials, technocrats, and those with links to the industrial lobby, who seek to emulate the success of their neighbour in East Asia, that of Japan. With abounding industrialisastion, an Empire of their own, and a brave attempt at the democracy, many sincerely believe that Japan is the most comparable and suitable example to inspire China as an amiable opportunity for state development.\n\nOn the opposing end however, are those that believe to hold themselves to an even greater democratic ideal. Proponents of national harmony, egalitarianism, and liberal constitutionalism, they have joined together to advocate for policies similar to that of The Whigs and Tories in Britain, now the Liberals and Conservatives. Citing Westminster parliamentarianism as the root inspiration for democracy in the East, this group of \"Westminsterites\" are largely motivated by their nationalistic tendencies, or Pro-Western and Pro-British ties, hoping to stave off any nascent Japanophilia within the Government."

He is to be buried in a grand family tomb with various lots already prepared for his wives and concubines. His memorial service will be attended by millions, a massive turn of fortunes for a man who had a difficult road to power.\n\nAmong those attending his funeral are men hoping to take his place. When President Shen attempted to groom his son Shen Rongguang as his successor, the (relatively) young General is seen as too comparitively insignificant to take power right now. His father has died too soon, leaving the old Shen Army Faction in shambles.\n\nPrime Minister Zhu Jiahua is as ruthless as a snake. Having built his own clique in the government, he is quickly utilising his Jingxing Society ties to win over the old Beiyang establishment, foreign emissaries, and curry a gentlemanly image to contrast with the \"bandit\" heritage of his rivals. Unlike those Guangxi \"bumpkins\" who spent all but a few years of their lives in a backwards province, the cosmopolitan Zhu grew up in Eastern China, studied abroad, and worked in both Beijing and Guangzhou. But his route to power ultimately hinges on swaying key powerholders like the two Yangs in the army, his rivals in the Political Science Clique, and fellow Jingxing affiliate Ma Junwu to shore up his Guangxi base.\n\nResisting this palace coup is the ambitious General Li Yaohan. His push for the Presidency faces difficult odds because he is from Guangdong and not particularly respected by the late Marshal Shen's Guangxi officers. Shen Rongguang however can generally count on the support of his father's people, who were generally tight-knit. If the two could ally fast enough, they may be able to seize control with the help of the PSC. But there are large egos and different generations involved."

 GXC.endgame.690.b: "Li Yaohan and Shen Rongguang ally to contest the Presidency!"

 GXC.endgame.691.t: "Music and Culture in Guangxi"
 GXC.endgame.691.d: "Guangxi is a melting pot of ethnic groups and cultures. The victory of the old Guangxi Clique has made the province an object of fascination by Chinese intellectuals, many of whom previously dismissed it as a backwater, who seek to explore reasons why they came out on top. While plenty have focused on the militaristic aspects of Guangxi society, there has also been a greater appreciation (and government support for) its people.\n\nThe Double Third Festival (Sanyuesan) is sometimes referred to as the Washing Festival and it is a nation-wide holiday celebrated in April where people honor their ancestors at the riverside and then bathe to clean their bodies of filth before enjoying the day with picnics. The festival is particularly prominent among the Zhuang, who celebrate with songs, dance, games, and food. While some cultural scholars have recently sought to use it as a means of distinguishing Zhuang culture, for the most part it has become a tourism draw.\n\nTourists in Guangxi often go to the old city of Guilin known for its excellent view of the Li River and the Jingjiang Prince's city. Guangxi cuisine is influenced by the lighter Cantonese cuisine and the spicy and sour Guizhou cuisines, often mixing glutinous rice with hot and sour condiments. The different regions of Guangxi often have their own unique styles of flavoring as well.\n\nA Guangxi Federation of Literary and Art Circles has also been established in Nanning among cultural workers, collecting folk music and promoting the humanities. Though comparatively obscure, Guangxi music can sometimes include distinct elements. The Jing are known for a stringed instrument known as the Duxianqin and the Zhuang are known for their Bayin instrument ensembles. Their most famous folk singer is Liu Sanjie, a 1100s Zhuang musician whose work is being rediscovered. Guangxi is also home to Guiju, similar to Beijing Opera but sung in the Guilin dialect."
 GXC.endgame.691.a: "A lovely province and wonderful people."

 GXC.endgame.692.t: "A World Turned Upside Down"
 GXC.endgame.692.d: "It was not too long ago that the Zhili were in their prime - having defeated the Kuomintang with German support, they then routed the Fengtian Clique and their allies in the ensuing conflicts to claim Beijing and total leadership of China. In that era, the battered Old Guangxi Clique and their bickering generals were forced to play an auxiliary role, hired henchmen for the Zhili to subjugate the south.\n\nThe Zhili then of course ruled for a decade, entrenching themselves in the bureaucracy and army, forming the Harmony Association to herd politicians under their umbrella, making exploitative deals with the Germans, fighting amongst themselves for influence, and ultimately growing decadent and arrogant as their hired warlords grew stronger and more discontent until finally their house of cards collapsed.\n\nNow the Old Guangxi Clique are the ascendent power and the ex-Zhili are the ones desperately seeking to claw whatever influence they can muster. The Shen Army Faction was always an intermediary of sorts between the two, a splinter from the broader Old Guangxi Clique that received extensive Zhili patronage after the Northern Expedition.\n\nOf course it would not be too difficult to share power right now, with the ex-Zhili primarily concentrated in the North and East while the Guangxi Clique and allies primarily are a southern force. Withdrawing our military garrisons and allowing for civilian rule would likely stabilise the country. But one never knows when the next turn of fortune may occur, or what they are scheming."

##NPA Epilogue Events (720-749):
 GXC.endgame.720.t: "The Sword of Progress"
 GXC.endgame.720.d: "Perhaps nothing detested more in Chinese Society is the militant and self-interested warlord. To many, the warlord is but the bandit with the biggest stick, with only self aggrandisement and plundering as hobbies. Yet, certain warlords have been known to the Chinese people not as bandits, but as heroes.\n\nCai E will forever be remembered as the man who stood up to Yuan Shikai's autocratic empire, and defended the republic against overwhelming odds. Sun Chuanfang, the master of Eastern China for nearly a decade, will be remembered in Jiangsu as a man of the peasantry. Wu Peifu, his association with the failing Beijing regime notwithstanding, will be remembered as a pillar of anti-japanese resistance in the nation during its most trying years. Lu Yuguang, the Young Marshal of the South and heir to Lu Rongting of the Green Forest, hopes to rule the ailing nation not as an autocratic bandit and leave China worse than when he found it, but as a progressive-minded leader of Southern sensibilities.\n\nSuch an administration will certainly shake up the politics of the nation. China has long been ruled by Confucian morality, first under the Sons of Heaven and then by the traditionalist Beiyang militarists. Yet here stands Lu Yuguang, the first ruler of all China to hail from Southern China since the last of the Ming Emperors.\n\nWhile none of sound mind expect him to rule as a radical firebrand in the image of Sun Yat-sen's band of socialist revolutionaries, perhaps Lu will carve a path not too dissimilar from the spirit of Li Yuanhong's Progressive Party, or Liang's Research and Constitutionalist Parties. The young son of Lu Rongting has surrounded himself with progressive intellectuals, all hoping that the Young Marshal will lend his ear to their idealistic ideas. Of course, the Young Marshal knows better than to heed the advice of dreamers too closely, but perhaps the Chinese Republic will finally know a ruler who may alleviate the suffering of the people."
 GXC.endgame.720.a: "Three cheers for Lu Yuguang, man of the hour!"

 GXC.endgame.721.t: "Zhili's Natural Successors"
 GXC.endgame.721.d: "The Republic of China throughout its few decades of existence has gone through great change. In the high period of the Warlord Era, it seemed that every year harkened a new militarist regime sitting in the halls of Zhongnanhai in Beijing. The end of the warlord era ushered in a restoration of the Qing monarchy, but after a decade of laboured existence, it fell to the wayside, alongside the Zhili Clique.\n\nNow for the first time since the Great Ming, the Central Kingdom has been unified from the South. Perhaps though, this new Republic will follow the legacy of the Zhili Government of the 20s and 30s. Ma Ji and Lu Yuguang share power as the Jade Marshal and King of Baoding had, and together guide the National Assembly in leading China out of the turmoil of the earlier 20th Century and into an age of peace and prosperity. Certain democratic processes have been restored, but greater pluralism continues to elude the new government.\n\nHowever, the military continues to retain significant power behind the scenes, with the officers of the Guangxi Clique entrenching themselves with positions of great power in the Republic, likely to form the core nucleus of a new elite for generations to come. This has left many disenfranchised former military men of losing cliques and factions grumbling at the current state of affairs, but unable to bring about political change in their favour due to the heightened state of stability the nation finds itself in.\n\nThe Guangxi Clique comes to power at a critical point in the history of China, with the Empire of Japan's efforts to subjugate the nation thwarted and the end of the Century of Humiliation finally upon its doorsteps. Undoubtedly, the rule of Lu Yuguang and Ma Ji will shape the direction of the Republic for decades, if not centuries, and history will judge if the adopted sons of a bandit rule well."
 GXC.endgame.721.a: "The sons of Guangxi chart us to tomorrow through the lessons of yesterday!"

 GXC.endgame.722.t: "1000 Years of Commerce"
 GXC.endgame.722.d: "Once the dominant titan of all affairs from West to East, the heyday of Merchants and Business carrying exceedingly large amounts of political weight invokes thoughts of earlier centuries, of a time long past, of the Hanseatic League, of the great mercantile empires, or of the Plutocratic states of Rome and Greece. However, as times have evolved, so too have the forms upon which the wealthy exhert their political influence and weaponise their monetary funds. Becoming politicians, or funding their campaigns, clever donations, brazen corruption, all manners of less than honourable pursuits of power. Yet in China, the incumbent government invokes a memory of a more refined period; dominated by the elites on true consensus of the best avenues for Chinese industry to pursue.\n\nWith strapping suits and fresh handshakes, all manner of legislative and executive matters are settled, perhaps with a red envelope from \"distant cousins\" here and there. Ruled directly by those bankers, industrialists, and merchants that remain hands behind the throne in many other countries, Chen Lianbo has become something of a mogul or an example for his fellow entrepreneurs and businessmen to strive towards. Dressed in the finest money can buy, and with a direct yet calculating form of politics, the once mere Mayor of Guangzhou and former \"traitor\" has arisen to become one of the richest men in the world.\n\nFinally achieving his ambitions of a responsible Merchant-led government, Chen's cabinet meetings are stacked with officials from all key industries, representing what many allude to as the Chinese Zaibatsu. With nary a concern for perfidious issues of land reform, Chen's domestic and economic policy has resulted in grand strides of industrialisation and financial growth, albeit few of those toiling the fields and working in the factories could honestly tell the difference between the old and the new. But the position of China has rapidly become that of the \"world's factory\", as the merchants yearn to ascend to even greater heights, and profits."
 GXC.endgame.722.a: "Money makes the world go round."

 GXC.endgame.723.t: "From a Revolutionary to a Statesman"
 GXC.endgame.723.d: "As far as Chinese revolutionaries fare, Liu Zhenhuan's career may perhaps be the most remarkable. Joining the Tongmenghui in 1907, he would incorporate individuals like Shen Hongying into the Guangxi Uprising. Through many years of long, arduous, and deadly fighting, Liu's revolutionary activities displayed a genuine sense of conviction and belief in the ideals of the Tongmenghui and Kuomintang. Young and vigorous, he was a reliable soldier of the revolution, organising soldiers in Guangxi on numerous occasions, working to further the revolution in South East Asia, and even joining the Old Guangxi Clique, betraying them for Chen Jiongming and the Guangdong Army. However, transforming into what was in-effect a warlord during the 1920s, the once optimistic revolutionary would become a man marred in conflict.\n\nFlagrantly disobeying orders from Dr. Sun Yat-sen, Liu's Guangxi Army would become that of a liability, only taking action in-line with the Kuomintang if it was to Liu's own benefit. Hitching himself to the Political Science Clique, Liu would cooperate with Yang Ximin to defend their interests. However, after having disagreements with the Reorganisation of 1924, and with ambitions to take over Guangxi, Liu would attempt an ousting of the Guangdong government, ultimately being cast into exile in Hong Kong. Liu's return to the Liangguang political scene would coincide with Political Science's own return to prominence.\n\nElected President at the head of a cross-party coalition to prevent Merchant dictatorship, Liu's glories as a war hero, alongside his easygoing relations with Progressive democrats and other Warlords, managed to see him secure the Presidential Office. Having been nicknamed \"The Chinese Monroe\" due to his consistent exhortations of national unity and anti-partisan governance, Liu's patrician progressivism has marked him as a surprising democrat. On the path to true democracy, it would appear that the National Revolution has found its footing, but in the most odd of bedfellows."
 GXC.endgame.723.a: "Perhaps the future is bright ater all."

 GXC.endgame.724.t: "The Reich of the East"
 GXC.endgame.724.d: "For Millennia, China stood unrivaled as the world's greatest empire. Thus, the Qing Emperors did not meet the rise of the European Colonial powers with the seriousness owed, and suffered the consequences of arrogance. The Century of Humiliation taught the Chinese nation that if China was to become great again, it must learn from the lessons of the West, and adopt its strengths while avoiding its weaknesses. While some viewed Britain or the United States as the pillars of the West that China ought to learn from, the British Revolution and Second American Civil War showed their inherent weaknesses.\n\nLi Linsi, founder of the Jingxing Society, toured Europe to promote Chinese culture in the West and study European developments, and found Germany to be the true beating heart of the Continent. While Britain and France degenerated into fanatic workers' states, it was Germany who continued to develop a stable and rational government that brought prosperity to its people. After Germany intervened in China to prevent the spread of Chinese Bolshevism, Jingxing continued to encourage further ties between Berlin and Beijing. Jingxing member Zhu Jiahua found himself in Guangdong in the early 30s, and through circumstance and luck, was able to secure the Presidency of the Republic in the midst of General Shen's passing.\n\nWith China consolidated for the first time in decades, it falls to Zhu to restore order across the Middle Kingdom and determine the outlook of the Republic. A staunch germanophile, Zhu looks to utilise the German connection China has been afforded with, and restore China's greatness on the world stage. Bismarckian State socialism, long supported by China's elite, will become the core economic thought of Zhu's China. German democracy, the proven superior to Anglo democracy, shall ensure that the Chinese people enjoy proper pluralism and liberty. The Dragon and the Eagle shall fly as one, until the Dragon soars above all once again."
 GXC.endgame.724.a: "President Zhu knows success when he sees it!"

 GXC.endgame.725.t: "A Republic Helmed by Iron Will"
 GXC.endgame.725.d: "The Zhili Clique, the natural governing force across China, continues to lead the charge in restoring our humbled nation back into the isles of greatness. Although the Beijing Government was not to last forever, Cao Kun, Wu Peifu, and Sun Chuanfang must be applauded for restoring stability across the nation after the sheer chaos of the High Warlord Era. Yet even though the mighty Jade and League Marshals were unable to stem the chaos of the late 30s, Marshal Shen Hongying was able to follow their pristine example and restore order across the nation.\n\nMarshal Shen gave his life for the Republic's revitalisation, and all the nation honours his sacrifice. As Marshal Shen followed the footsteps of Wu and Sun, so too shall Marshal Li Yaohan. An elderly man like Shen and Wu, Marshal Li is not expected to rule over China for long. However, Marshal Li's commitment to order and progress is exceeded by none, and he shall ensure that China's governance will be put on the right track before his time on this world comes to an end. The National Assembly carries out legislation for the economic and social reconstruction of the nation, and the military continues to restore order across the land.\n\nMarshal Li in his seven decades of life has seen what has failed and what has worked, and will undoubtedly guide the Assembly with his wisdom. The Li Yaohan administration has stated a commitment to continuing the prosperity and developmentalism of the old Zhili government of Cao, and with Li's forces consolidating control over all China, few doubt his ability to enact his ambition. Many recognise that the era of selfishness and opportunism has come to an end, and the elderly marshal shall guide all into a burgeoning Chinese Century."

 GXC.endgame.900.d.RCA: "During the last decades of the Qing Dynasty, many Chinese revolutionaries found themselves fleeing to Southeast Asia, where many overseas Chinese communities had formed, sympathetic to the republican cause. Standing out above the rest, Malaya became the hotbed of Chinese revolution, with future Kuomintang leader Wang Jingwei meeting his wife, the Malayan born Chinese Chen Bijun, in Singapore.\n\nMany prominent Malayan Chinese businessmen offered financial support to the burgeoning Tongmenghui, and rejoiced for their mainlander comrades following the success of the Xinhai Revolution. However, while China freed itself from the shackles of the decrepit Qing, Malayan Chinese continued to toil under British colonial rule. While many were hopeful for a free Malaya following the collapse of the British Empire, it would not be the Malayans who received the fruits of Britain's fall, but the ascendant German Empire.\n\nFortunately, when hostilities in Europe flared up once more, Germany found itself unable to hold its Asian Empire and was driven out for good. After decades of British and German colonial rule, Malaya finally finds itself free from imperialism, liberated by the might of the National Revolutionary Army and the indomitable spirit of the Malayan people.\n\nChairman [ROOT.GetLeader] has in particular noticed the contributions of Zhuang Mingli, chairman of the General Labour Union of Malaya. Born in Fujian, Zhuang grew up in Penang and became involved with the Chinese revolutionary organisations.

 GXC_beiyang_of_the_south_modifier_desc: "The Beiyang Republic undoubtedly has a complex legacy; under noble intentions revolutionaries sundered an autocratic and collapsing monarchy, instituting a fresh republican national order. And yet the abounding optimism of revolutionaries can hardly compare to the harsh realities of power brokering and establishment politics. Under the affairs of individuals such as Duan Qirui, Yuan Shikai, and Feng Guozhang, the Southern-led revolution became one that was contorted under the ambitions of military strongmen and force of arms. Shattered, broken, and then promptly reunited once again in 1928, the aspirations of the original Xinhai revolutionaries would be but a faint memory in only the oldest soldiers and politicians. But the legacy of the Five Races Under One Union still shines true in some of its most devout descendants and believers, of whom occupy the seat of power within the Chinese nation-state.\n\nAffirming the right of the Southern militarists over that of the North, the new Beiyang Republic has avowed to be an evolution of previous efforts to unite and centralise the Chinese Republican project. Despite national apathy to the new incumbents, the Chinese nation can at least breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that the nation has been reunified, and the time of rebuilding is sure to follow.

Although his Old Guangxi Clique is master of Guangxi and Guangdong, the adopted son of Lu Rongting finds his regime pressed from all sides. From the East, Federalist and disgruntled Cantonese elements seek to end a decade of Guangxi dominance. From the West, the Kuomintang stands ready to restore Nationalist control over the South. Will the Young Marshal of the South weather the coming storm, or will he find himself consumed by the tides of Revolution and Federalism?"

 GXC_country_intro_header: "§RThe Hotbed of Revolution§!"
 GXC_country_intro_content: "Long the champion of anti-Northerner influence within the nation, the Pearl River Delta's history in the Warlord Era is marred by revolt, struggle, banditry, and revolution. With a looming anti-Qing struggle occurring within the region since the end of the §YTaiping Heavenly Rebellion§!, the Pearl of the South is naturally home to many of China's present day great revolutionaries. Forming revolutionary groups such as the §lTongmenghui§! and other likeminded revolutionaries, Liangguang (referring to the joint region of §YGuangxi§! and §YGuangdong§!) would have its own precursor uprisings before §lXinhai§! such as the §lSecond Guangzhou Uprising§!. These groups would finally play its part in the §lXinhai Revolution§! as a republican stronghold. With the seizure of Guangdong by §lChen Jiongming§! and §aHu Hanmin§!, and §YGuangxi§! by §PLu Rongting§!, the region would remain steadfast in the hands of the Republicans. With the declaration of the §YSecond Revolution§!, and its ultimate failure, §aHu Hanmin§! would be ousted as Governor, and replaced by §lChen§!, only for he himself to be ousted similarly and replaced by §PYuan§! Loyalist §PLong Jiguang§!.\n\nWith the onslaught of the §lNational Protection War§!, §YGuangxi§! would tepidly announce their support after the §aHuguojun§! saw initial outstanding successes, and march into §YGuangdong§! to depose the §PYuan§! loyalists. After a brief interim Southern Government hosted by National Protection leaders such as §SLiang Qichao§!, §mLi Genyuan§!, §aCen Chunxuan§!, and others, the §POld Guangxi Clique§! would effectively unite §YLiangguang§! under their dominion, at least on paper. With the chaos of the Warlord Era now in full swing, §eBeiyang§! infighting would see the proclamation of the §aConstitutional Protection Government§! in 1917, with its capital in §YGuangzhou§!. Led by the legendary §aSun Yat-sen§!, it would include the likes of §lChen Jiongming§!, §cXu Chongzhi§!, §aTang Jiyao§!, §PLu Rongting§!, §lTang Shaoyi§!, §aHu Hanmin§!, §cLi Liejun§!, and numerous others. Eventually being hijacked and ousting §aSun§!, the §aConstitutional Protection Government§! would attempt peace talks with the North.\n\nHaving been driven into §YFujian§!, §lChen Jiongming§! and §cXu Chongzhi§! would initiate the §lFirst Yue-Gui War§! in 1920, successfully ousting the §POld Guangxi clique§!, and instating §lChen§! as governor of §YGuangdong§!. With §aSun§! insisting upon a new extraordinary government that grants him executive powers, he would have a political schism with §lChen§!, and after fighting the §lSecond Yue-Gui War§! in 1921, which sent §YGuangxi§! into practical anarchy, the two would clash over the §YNorthern Expedition§!, Unification by Negotiation or by Subjugation, and Federalism over Centralism. Tensions would ultimately culminate in the §YJune 16th Incident§!, with the attempted shelling of §aSun's§! Palace by §aYe Ju§! and the §aOld Yue Clique§!.\n\nEngulfed in consistent conflict, many individuals would clash, and then defect or otherwise. With the rise in influence of warlords such as §PDeng Benyin§!, §mLiu Zhenhuan§!, §aYang Ximin§!, §PShen Hongying§!, §aLin Hu§!, §PHong Zhaolin§!, and numerous others, §YGuangdong§! would effectively become a patchwork of influences. Inflamed further by the §YMerchant Corps Incident§! of 1924, wherein §YGuangzhou's§! capitalists rose up to protect themselves in fear of §kKMT§! atrocities, the §PWhampoa Training Corps§! and §PAcademy§! would be formed that same year, and would drive out both §lChen Jiongming§! and §mChen Lianbo's§! forces. No longer willing to endure alliances with warlords in order to see unification of the nation, §aSun Yat-sen§! would initiate the Reorganisation of the Kuomintang. In exile, §lChen Jiongming§! would found the §lPublic Interest Party§! in 1925."

 GXC_country_intro_header_1: "§lParty-State Infighting and the Northern Expedition§!"
 GXC_country_intro_content_1: "Politically, the §kKuomintang§! transformed radically. As reformists and Federalists flocked to the various Federalist leaders in the nation, the Party would be reorganised in 1924, establishing a democratic centralist form of organisation, an alliance with the §RInternational§!, and a United Front with the §rChinese Syndicalist Party§!. With §aSun§! heading north to engage in peace talks, the Party would fracture further due to lack of §aSun's§! leadership in the South. After §aSun's§! death, acting Generalissimo §aHu Hanmin§!, §aSun's§! presumed successor, would engage in a power struggle with §RWang Jingwei§!, §PChiang Kai-shek§!, §RLiao Zhongkai§!, §cZhu Peide§!, and §cXu Chongzhi§!. Simultaneously, §aTang Jiyao§! would attempt an invasion of §YLiangguang§!, only to be halted by recent §kKuomintang allies§!, the §PNew Guangxi Clique§!.\n\nWith many rightist party members moving to the §YShanghai§! Headquarters due to increasing §Rleftist§! activity in §YGuangdong§!, §aHu§! would be ousted by a §YNational Government Council§!. Almost managing to clinch victory from §RWang§! and §PChiang's§! hands, the assassination attempt on §RLiao Zhongkai§! would cause a mass purge of rightists within the Party by §aHu's§! enemies. Reinvigorated, the United Front would hold strong, and the schism between the §aOld Right§! and §RLeft§! wings of the party would grow larger. Growing disillusioned, the §aOld Right§! would hold the §cWestern Hills Conference§! in late 1925, and subsequently be expelled by the §kCentral Executive Committee§!, later fleeing to §YShanghai§!. With the political situation somewhat stabilised in favour of the United Front, the §kKuomintang§! would launch their §YNorthern Expedition§! from §YLiangguang§! under the stewardship of §RWang§! and §aChiang§! in July 1926.\n\nLaunching the expedition with the newly formed §PNational Revolutionary Army§!, it consisted of the reorganised and committed allied warlord armies alongside the newly elite §PWhampoa-born 1st Army§!, led by §PChiang§! and §PHe Yingqin§!. Alongside the §P1st§!, is that of §cTan Yankai's 2nd§!, §cZhu Peide's 3rd§!, §lLi Jishen's 4th§!, §aLi Fulin's 5th§!, §aCheng Qian's 6th§!, §PLi Zongren's 7th§!, and §rTang Shengzhi's 8th§!. Initially successful, reaching §YWuchang§! in September, the §YNorthern Expedition§! would be crippled by the German Intervention in October, overrunning §YGuangzhou§! by November. With the §k4th Army§! attempting reasonable resistance, the §a5th§! would disintegrate, causing §PChiang§! to reorient the §P1st Army§! south in an attempt to relieve the siege. Seen as abandoning the front, it is incredibly unpopular, and their intense assault would result in failure.\n\nWith §YGuangzhou§! in German hands, their relatively high casualties would result in their refusal to move further, instead opting for their §zZhili§! allies to finish the job; appointing §mChen Lianbo§! as Mayor in the interim. §PChiang's§! failure would see his ousting by §RWang§! with the support of §lLi Jishen§!, §lZhang Fakui§!, §RTang Shengzhi§!, §cTan Yankai§! and §cZhu Peide§!. Meeting in private with §PHe Yingqin§! and §PBai Chongxi§!, §PChiang§! would resign with §lLi Jishen§! taking his place. With the §P1st§! no longer responding to orders, only directly listening to §PChiang§!, §RDeng Yanda§! and the §Rleft-wing§! militias organise a strike in §YGuangzhou§!. In January 1927 the §YBattle of Jinhua§! is fought by the §l4th army§! with assistance from the §c3rd§! and §R8th§!, causing the practical disintegration of the §l4th§! and §R8th§! armies as they retreat to form a guerrilla struggle in §kMinGan§!.\n\nReturning to power due to §lLi's§! failure, §PChiang§! would swiftly initiate a political marriage with §aSong Meiling§!, intimidate §PHe Yingqin§! back into cowed alliance, and with fear of the left's influence would be backed by §cZhu Peide§! and a (reluctant) §PLi Zongren§!, alongside an incredibly apprehensive §aCheng Qian§!, to the position of Generalissimo. Ordering the §YLong March§! westward to §YGuangxi§!, §YGuizhou§!, and southwestern §YHunan§!, §RWang Jingwei§! and §RLiao Zhongkai§! would lead the §RCentral Executive Committee§! into exile.\n\nWith §nYuan Zuming's§! defection to §eBeiyang§! and an attempted invasion yet again from §aTang Jiyao§! prior, the §YLong March§! turned disorderly, and following §PChiang's§! assassination in early February, would result in a drove of defections, and the assumption of control of the §PNRA§! by §cZhu Peide§!. Now tepidly based in §YGuizhou§! (due to the §aYunnan Clique's§! own infighting preventing their ousting) and parts of §YGuangxi§!, the §kKuomintang§! would be slowly pushed deeper into the former, and the §YNorthern Expedition§! would officially come to an end in February 1927 with the Party-State continuing its struggle in §YGuizhou§!, §kMinGan§!, and §YShanghai§!."

 GXC_country_intro_header_2: "§gThe Liangguang Interregnum§!"
 GXC_country_intro_content_2: "Leaving chaos in their departure, the advancing §zNorthern§! and §MSouthern Zhili§! armies would begin to use irregulars and auxiliary formations from local factions to further shore up control as §eFengtian§! initiated the §Y3rd Zhili-Fengtian War§! in February 1927. Instigated by clashes between §PZhang Zongchang§! and §cWu Peifu§!, the §zZhili§! would deftly deal with §PZhang Zuolin§! and the §eFengtian Clique§!. In the meantime, the §POld Guangxi§! and §aOld Guangdong Cliques§!, with members having either fled to §zZhili§! lines or retired, would be returned to power and influence within their localities. With the §MSouthern Zhili§! rather ambiguously settling on §PShen Hongying§! as Governor of §YGuangdong§!, §mChen Lianbo§! would retain his German appointed and §zZhili§! affirmed Mayorship of §YGuangzhou§!, in-part due to negotiations required for the German withdrawal. Neither would control the majority of the province, and through the acquisition of former warlords on §mChen§! and §PShen's§! payrolls, would further fracture into fiefdoms.\n\nIn §YGuangxi§!, the various disparate clans compete for unification in the void left by §PNew Guangxi's§! retreat, ultimately resulting in §PLu Rongting§! (to the surprise of many) managing to manoeuvre himself back into power. With his venerable age and reputation shoring out any issues of control, he is reluctantly recognised as Governor of §YGuangxi§! by the §zNorthern Zhili§!. To the south, in §YQiongya§!, §aDeng Benyin§! returns to power in the island after a concerted effort from §mChen Lianbo§! and the Germans, establishing a tepid alliance between §YQiongya§! and §YGuangzhou§!.\n\nSlowly expanding their spheres of control, §mChen Lianbo§! himself begun hiring former §aGuangdong Army§! (Both §kKuomintang§! and Federalist) officers to further bulk up his §mMerchant Corps§!, resulting in the employment of individuals such as §aChen Jitang§!, §lChen Jiongming§! (albeit he refused a military position), §aYe Ju§! and others. In conjunction with this, he hired individuals such as §mLiu Zhenhuan§!, and §aYang Ximin§!. With the conclusion of the §Y4th Zhili-Fengtian War§! and the §YCER Conflict§!, the §zZhili§! announced scheduled elections, and in the meantime §PSun Chuanfang§! formally incorporated Hunan, §YGuangxi§!, and §YGuangdong§! into the §YLeague of Five Provinces§! in 1929, becoming the §YLeague of Eight Provinces§!.\n\nWith the new elections of 1929 resulting in a §aHarmony Association§! landslide, the §lUnited National Construction League§! is formed by democratically minded Chinese intellectuals from the §nYoung China Party§!, §cDemocratic Constitutionalist Party§!, §mPolitical Science Clique§! (recently legalised), §lPublic Interest Party§!, §cPeople's Government Party§!, and plenty others, although the inclusion of the likes of §kKuomintang§! adjacents such as §RZhang Bojun§! and §RTan Pingshan§! draws heavy scrutiny. With §PZhang Zuolin's§! refusal to entertain unification negotiations after the §zZhili§! landslide election, §PSun Chuanfang§! would trigger the §YLeague Crisis§! of 1930 as he ambiguously responds to overtures from §PZhang Zuolin§! about restarting the Civil War.\n\nPromoting Federalist rhetoric to protect the §YLeague's§! autonomy, amongst other power plays, would see the §YShanghai Uprising§! erupt in 1932. Resulting in catastrophic reverberations throughout the nation, it would see the fleeing of intellectuals into the interior, and the resulting interior policy from the §YLeague§! itself would see §PShen Hongying's§! backers retreat, crippling his position. Swiftly §PLu Rongting§! would coordinate an alliance with §mChen Lianbo§! and §aDeng Benyin§!, pushing §PShen§! out of major positions in §YGuangxi§! and §YGuangdong§!. In return the §zNorthern Zhili§! recognised §PLu§! as §YViceroy of Liangguang§! to check §PSun Chuanfang§!. Similarly §PLu§! signed an under-the-table agreement of mutual defence with §cZhao Hengti§!; should §PSun§! attempt to re-assert himself within the Southwestern provinces.\n\nAs 1934 dawned, §PLu Rongting§! would die of natural causes, leaving much of his work to centralise the provinces of §YLiangguang§! uncomplete. His adopted sons, §aLu Yuguang§! (his groomed successor, and the Young Marshal of the South), and §aMa Ji§! take his place. Rearing their §aYoung Guangxi§! faction of the §POld Guangxi Clique§! to the forefront, it is a triumvirate, even quadvirumrate, between §aLu§!, §aMa§!, §aLiu Zhilu§!, and §aLin Hu§!. §PShen§! remains, hardly holding on, whilst §lChen§! continues his nominally \"democratic\" operations within §YGuangzhou§!."

 GXC_country_intro_header_3: "Political Diaspora in Yue-Gui"
 GXC_country_intro_content_3: "§MThe Guangxi and Guangdong Cliques§!\nIn the chaos and anarchy of the §kKuomintang§! collapse many parties and factions, both old and new, have returned or otherwise appeared at the forefront of §YLiangguang§! politics. Chiefly amongst them, the §POld Guangxi Clique§! and its disparate internal factions, the Federalists within the nation, gentry and merchants, and all other manner of individuals. As de-facto the most powerful group within the region, the §POld Guangxi Clique§! remains disunited, split between the §aYoung Guangxi Faction§! and the §PShen Army Faction§!, with minor clans in and amongst their ranks.\n\nThe §aYoung Guangxi Faction§! profess a broad stroke ideological tendency towards old-style Republican Revolutionary politics, with ties to the §mPolitical Science Clique§!, and various other political groups. Ultimately quite pragmatic, they remain focused on extending ther influence within the South of the nation. Their chief rivals are the §MSouthern Zhili§! backed §PShen Army Faction§!, based around the eponymous §PShen Hongying§!. Ailing and elderly, the bandit turned statesman has long been yearning to stake his claim as Governor of §YGuangdong§! even in the diminishing circumstances. With a tepid alliance with the §aJingxing Society§! and other Pro-German Pro-South Zhili interest groups in the region, his disparate band of bandits seek to confirm their power promised to them in 1927.\n\nOperating within the urban hub of §YGuangzhou§! are those keen on wheeling and dealing, with a firm handshake masquerading less than noble intentions. With Mayor §mChen Lianbo§! exercising authority through his §lAmerican-inspired§! §mCanton Merchant Corps§! and extensive business connections within the province, he has managed to hire and invite numerous intellectuals and independents to his flock. Primarily represented through Senator §lChen Jiongming§!, founder and leader of the §lPublic Interest Party§! (founded in 1925), championing Federalism and democracy in the region. On his flank is the §SNational Renaissance Society§! led by Zhang Junmai, formed in 1932, as a subsect of the §cChinese Constitutionalist Party§!. Focused on adapting German Social Democracy to China, it carries a notable socialist tint with members such as §RZhang Dongsun§! championing Guild Socialism.\n\nSimilarly, they are joined by independent members of the political battleground, such as §mLin Zhengxuan§!, Speaker of the Assembly and member of the §mPolitical Science Clique§!. Other individuals associated are the likes of §aLin Hu§!, §mLiu Zhenhuan§!, and §aYang Ximin§!. Similarly the gentry are represented through the local §cGrain Industry Maintenance Association§!, having long been backers and friends of §lChen Jiongming§!, they have renewed their strength to protect their interests. In addition local warlords such as §aYang Ruxuan§! and §aChisheng§!, alongside §aDeng Benyin§! amongst others, scatter to protect their interests. Hardly a democratic cornucopia, §YGuangzhou§! nonetheless remains a Pearl on the River Delta.\n\n§MThe Kuomintang§!\nWhilst the §kKuomintang§! have very little overt influence within the region, they still retain sizeable unnofficial influence. Skirmishing militias in §YGuangxi's§! east, §rPeng Pai's§! rural movement in §YGuangdong's§! peasant slums, and various §kMinGan§! irregulars flowing in and out across the border co-exist with the influence of \"legitimate\" actors: §aChen Jitang§! and his §aNew Guangdong Clique§!, §aWei Bangping§! and his old ties, and other sympathetic minor actors. However in true adherence there remains one man with his eyes set on returning to China after nigh almost a decade of exile. §aSun Yat-sen's§! most orthodox successor, and his legitimist, §aHu Hanmin§!. Head of the §aRight Kuomintang§! and of the §aMoscow Central Executive Committee§!, he has close ties to the likes of §aChen Jitang§! in Guangdong and §cZhu Peide§! in Yunnan.\n\nWithin his camp resides the rest of the \"Old Right\". Pursuing a course of orthodox sanminism, §aHu§! seeks to implement §aDr. Sun Yat-sen's§! will to the utmost, applying the Three Principles of the People akin to a formula. On his left resides (in absentia) §lSun Fo's§! Hawaiian based §lReconstruction Faction§!, who maintained ties with both §RWang§! in Paris and §aHu§! in Moscow. Espousing a more immediately \"democratic\" interpretation of the §RThree Principles§! based primarily on §aDr. Sun's§! pre-Socialist writings, they aspire to swiftly implement the Tutelage phase followed through swiftly by the Constitutional period.\n\nSimilarly, there resides the §cWestern Hills Clique§! led by §cJu Zheng§!, §cLin Sen§!, §cZou Lu§!, §cXu Chongzhi§!, and §cLi Liejun§!. They are staunch legalists, constitutionalists, and anti-Socialists resolutely opposed to the United Front. Counted as odd ducks amongst the relatively civilian-tied aforementioned factions is that of the §PNew Guangxi Clique Quadvirumrate§!. §PUltra-militaristic§! and focused on their militia system, §PLi Zongren§!, §PBai Chongxi§!, §PHuang Shaohong§!, and §PHuang Xuchu§!, seek to implement their own interpretation of the §RThree Principles§!.\n\nFinally, there exists the left wing of the party and their key players. §SChen Mingshu§! of the §SNew 4th Army§! of the §PNRA§!, aligned with the §rProvisional Action Committee§! but with his own interpretation of dealing with the establishment. §rTan Pingshan§!, one of the founders of §rProvisional Action§! who was ousted by §rDeng§! and §rSong§!, with his §rGuangdong Provisional Action Branch§! focused on a synthesis of syndicalism with the §rPAC's§! traditional agrarian socialism. Finally, there is §rPeng Pai§!, a hero to the peasantry of §YGuangdong§! and a resistance fighter against the tyranny of the gentry. He is focused on alleviating the agrarian plight of China's rural masses through a peasant-based programme."

 GXC_five_year_plan_effect_desc: "Under the ambitious plans of the Democratic Socialists, the whole Frontier of China and the regions north of the Great Wall have been earmarked for continuous and concerted economic development.

 GXC_economic_self_sufficiency_modifier_desc: "On the road to strengthening the Chinese Republic, the nation can only achieve true independence and assert itself on the international stage if it can achieve a certain level of economic development independent of that of foreign enterprises.

 GXC_balancing_the_levers_of_government_desc: "Harmonious balance is a virtue that all Chinese governments must aspire towards, and the current iteration of the Beiyang Republic is no different. Imposed by Old Guangxi aficionados, various necessary alliances and old friends have been brought together under the notion of continued administration, and the pursuit of a national strengthening campaign. The Central Government has become split into three faces: the Political Science Clique, the Jingxing Society, and the various compatriots of the Old Guangxi and Zhili Cliques. Together, they ward off any attempts from outside influences to intercede on their governance."
