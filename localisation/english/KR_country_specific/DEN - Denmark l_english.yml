 DEN_black_monday_category: "Crisis in Denmark"
 DEN_black_monday_category_desc: "The Mitteleuropean Economic Crisis has arrived in Denmark, and already Thorvald Stauning and his government have been pressured to take the crisis by its reins and recover from it as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, such desires have been largely gated by an impasse in the Rigsdag, which has prevented any bills from being passed without approval by the opposition. This deadlock has led to ongoing negotiations with the §S'Socials' coalition§! of Stauning and his allies against §mVenstre§! and the opposition. This window will showcase the effects of negotiations to come, and it will conclude if the Kanslergade agreement comes to pass.\n\nKeeping the §Scabinet policy support§! equal to or less than the §mconcessions we make to the opposition§! will ensure that §mVenstre§! will be satisfied enough to let our bill pass. However, prioritising our own agenda to appease §lRadikale Venstre§! and our coalition will only lead to detriment, as none of these bills can pass the Rigsdag in its current state.\n\nThe support for our cabinet's policies is: §S[?DEN_cabinet_policy_support]§!\n\nThe level of concessions to the opposition is: §m[?DEN_opposition_concessions]§!\n\nThe number of pooled economic credits we have is: §Y[?DEN_economic_credits]§!\n§gFor every economic credit we are able to acquire in surplus at the end of this focus tree, economic recovery will become noticeably quicker. Alternatively, economic credits may be spent in the succeeding tree for powerful bonuses.§!"
 DEN_recovery_preparedness: "The cabinet is ready to tackle the crisis."
 DEN_pacifist_accord_category: "Dealing with the Pacifist Accord"
 DEN_pacifist_accord_category_desc: "The time has come once again for Peter Munch to submit yet another demilitarisation bill to parliament, and this time he faces far more than just light resistance and a slap on the wrist. [GetSecondInCommand] has drafted an entire plan of action in order to convince Peter Munch to not only step down from his plans but also to convince the rest of the government that remilitarisation must come to pass. Danish neutrality is secure for the time being, but his plans go against KF-Venstre's idea, backed by the king, that Denmark needs to remilitarise.\n\nThe pacifist accord will come apart at the seams no matter what, but we can speed up the process through several methods.\n\nFirstly, we can invite Marshal Prior into negotiations with Munch and stress the necessity of the army in defending Danish democracy and sovereignty.\n\nSecondly, Munch may be an important factor of our coalition, but some heavier threats, including the status of his position and the role of Radikale Venstre in important cabinet positions, could persuade him into agreeing. However, this act will not be popular, and our own popularity will suffer.\n\nLastly, concessions to Radikale Venstre in terms of reforms that they desire will go a long way in ensuring that remilitarisation passes smoothly. Paying this price in the short term will prove fruitful for our remilitarisation efforts in the long term."

 DEN_prior_munch_negotiations: "Army-Involved Negotiations"
 DEN_prior_munch_negotiations_desc: "[GetSecondInCommand] opens negotiations with Munch alongside Marshal Prior, stressing not only the necessity for the army to protect democracy but also for Denmark to not fall to the extremes. Prior will stress that the primary goal of the army is to defend Danish sovereignty, and further demilitarisation will only run Denmark asunder, especially if our neighbour Germany falters to revanchist forces from the east and west."
 DEN_threaten_munch: "Threaten Munch"
 DEN_threaten_munch_desc: "Negotiations have gone off the rails, and as such, perhaps we should remind Munch of his position as Minister of Foreign Affairs and threaten to diminish Radikale Venstre's role in cabinet positions should he not accept some form of remilitarisation. Demands on this level will have destabilising effects on our governance, but knowing Munch's pride, he likely won't follow through on these threats."
 DEN_welfare_compromises: "Welfare Compromises"
 DEN_welfare_compromises_desc: "Long have the plans for the welfare state been criticised for undue government spending in sectors that Radikale Venstre disagrees with. By alleviating their concerns on spending and reallocating the necessary funds to the remilitarisation efforts instead, Peter Munch will have no choice but to acquiesce."
 DEN_social_spending: "Social Spending"
 DEN_social_spending_desc: "Madsen-Mygdal and his position on social reforms, much of which propagated Stauning's prime ministership, go against both his and his coalition partner's views on the matter. Despite this, Radikale Venstre ensured our majority in the last election, and perhaps throwing a minor token of adjustments to laws in certain sectors will appease his position on increased remilitarisation efforts."

 DEN_idea_liberal_coalition: "Liberal Coalition"
 DEN_idea_liberal_coalition_desc: "The prospect of Venstre and Radikale Venstre cooperating once more may seem extremely odd to many abroad, considering the means in which Radikale Venstre departed from our party three decades ago. Ongoing negotiations and met demands have led to the two liberal parties blossoming once more, which can only prove fruitful towards the centrist Venstre's survival."
 DEN_idea_farmer_support: "Support from Farmers"
 DEN_idea_farmer_support_desc: "Farmers make up a relatively high portion of the Venstre voting base, though the widespread industrialisation over the past century has dwindled the party's dominance. Supporting the farmers will pay off in the long run, aiding in continual electoral victories."
 DEN_idea_resumed_recruitment: "Resumed Recruitment"
 DEN_idea_resumed_recruitment_desc: "Denmark has not seen the horrors of war for many decades, but while witnessing the horrors of the Weltkrieg, Denmark must prepare itself for involvement by greatly increasing the size of its armed forces. Such efforts are not to be taken lightly but will assuredly be popular with much of the KF."
 DEN_idea_centre_right_dominance: "Centre-Right Dominance"
 DEN_idea_centre_right_dominance_desc: "Coalesced into a coalition spanning the moderate right wings of the KF and Venstre, it seems that Danish centre-right dominance has been cemented for years to come. While Stauning and Socialdemokratiet will soon gain momentum once peace returns to Denmark, Venstre and KF will usher in a bright future for every Danish citizen."
 DEN_idea_rehabilitate_antimilitarists: "Rehabilitate Antimilitarists"
 DEN_idea_rehabilitate_antimilitarists_desc: "Much of Radikale Venstre separated from our party decades ago to oppose militarisation, instead supporting pacifism and neutrality. While Denmark will inevitably be drawn into war again, concessions will have to be made to win back their support and continue reforms to modernise and develop the Danish army."
 DEN_idea_united_liberals: "United Liberals"
 DEN_idea_united_liberals_desc: "In a surprising turn of events, Forenede Venstre has been reformed following extensive negotiations between Radikale Venstre and Venstre itself, including Denmark's exit from a military alliance with Germany. Only time can tell whether Venstre will survive united once more or if it will only fracture again in the future."

 DEN_idea_opposition_anger_desc: "Until now, Thorvald Stauning's pragmatism has won bipartisan support from the opposition, but his new revisions to the constitution and promises made during the last election have worried much of the opposition. The opposition has openly warned Stauning that support will bottom out should Stauning stray too far from the aforementioned 'compromise' detailed in his electoral speech. Should Stauning tread carefully, his dreams for the most modern welfare state across the world will come to fruition."
 DEN_idea_extended_pensions: "Extended Pensions"
 DEN_idea_extended_pensions_desc: "To provide a more comfortable life in retirement for those among us who are no longer able to work, the government has decided to increase spending on the financing of pensions, as was outlined in K.K. Steincke's Social Reform Bill."
 DEN_idea_clarified_social_laws: "Clarified Social Laws"
 DEN_idea_clarified_social_laws_desc: "For a long time, Social Laws have been unorganised and divided into nearly a hundred different rules and regulations, some of which have been lost in time. By carefully identifying and clarifying these laws, the attributes of the modern Danish renaissance man will become known across the country."
 DEN_idea_pacified_antimilitarists: "Pacified Antimilitarists"
 DEN_idea_pacified_antimilitarists_desc: "Regardless of the means by which Denmark shall choose to arm itself, whether or not it will find itself at war is non-negotiable. A war may be on the horizon at any moment, and thus the antimilitarist elements that make up Radikale Venstre and Socialdemokratiet must go."
 DEN_idea_expanded_welfare_bureaucracy: "Expanded Welfare Bureaucracy"
 DEN_idea_expanded_welfare_bureaucracy_desc: "Expanding and centralising the up-and-coming bureaucracy will do wonders towards the expansion of the Danish welfare state and will be a boon in the long run to further manage government expenses towards making the life of the average Danish citizen better."
 DEN_idea_modern_welfare_reforms: "Modern Welfare Reforms"
 DEN_idea_modern_welfare_reforms_desc: "Socialdemokratiet's success in negotiations and compromises with Radikale Venstre has blossomed into what will forever endure as the modern welfare state, a model for those across the world to admire. Continued investment and development of K.K. Steincke's New Social Laws, as they are implemented, will only further cement the legacy of Socialdemokratiet's place in Danish history."
 DEN_idea_halted_reforms: "Halted Reforms"
 DEN_idea_halted_reforms_desc: "For better or for worse, Radikale Venstre has triumphed over the disgraced Socialdemokratiet, with the government having collapsed due to overwhelming pressure against the expansive and invasive welfare reforms. While this new government will aid in maintaining the spirit of Socialdemokratiet's programme, much of the state budget will be rediverted and put to better use at the behest of the average Danish citizen."
 DEN_idea_defending_the_statsraad_system: "Defending the Statsraad System"
 DEN_idea_defending_the_statsraad_system_desc: "Our young socialist republic has been under attack from reactionary forces abroad since its inception. While it will take years to achieve the goals we set in the Statsraad Congress, we must ensure that its ideals remain protected from outside threats."
 DEN_idea_true_danish_socialism: "True Danish Socialism"
 DEN_idea_true_danish_socialism_desc: "Advocated by the charismatic leader of the DVSP faction within Føderationen, Aksel's plans revolve around the incorporation of councilism to break the dominance of the trade unions, as well as the building of a Danish mass party. He has caught much attention from the other factions, and his plans may destabilise the future camaraderie held so far since the founding of Føderationen, but only time will tell how far he will go."
 DEN_idea_venstrekommunisme: "Venstrekommunisme"
 DEN_idea_venstrekommunisme_desc: "Venstrekommunisme, or Left Communism, is just one of the many influences that Aksel Larsen has adopted within the DVSP. The party line calls for broad power to the workers without being trapped within bureaucratic trade unions. Larsen will stop at nothing to help transform Denmark into a guiding star for many other socialist movements to take inspiration from."
 DEN_idea_bridged_gap: "Bridged Gap"
 DEN_idea_bridged_gap_desc: "To aid in the liberation of the workers and further the end of exploitation, Larsen has announced that the divide between rural and urban Denmark shall end. Public works programmes will help in bringing up every sector of Danish society. Denmark's agricultural sector, in particular, plummeted with industrialisation, so it will need special attention."
 DEN_idea_red_welfare: "Red Welfare"
 DEN_idea_red_welfare_desc: "Føderationen Stauningerne has finally completed its plans for the Danish welfare state with a socialist tinge, developed to completion with the help of Sigvald Hellberg and former radicals from Socialdemokratiet. The welfare reforms and all of K.K. Steincke's new social legislation passed without a hitch, in large part because there was no need to rely on a coalition with Radikale Venstre or the opposition in the Landsting to paralyse the government's ability to pass legislation. While unstable, Denmark shall drive itself into a future where every citizen is equal."
 DEN_idea_sailor_socialism: "Sailor Socialism"
 DEN_idea_sailor_socialism_desc: "For too long have the sailors within the trade union Søfyrbødernes Forbund been subjected to the defunding of the navy and reallocation of industries towards the so-called welfare state. Richard Jensen will not stand for this injustice against the most arduous and dedicated Danish citizens, the brave and young sailors. The government will prioritise the enhancement of our naval capabilities while addressing these historical inequities."
 DEN_idea_endless_revolutionary_struggle: "Endless Revolutionary Struggle"
 DEN_idea_endless_revolutionary_struggle_desc: "Richard Jensen espouses the endless revolutionary struggle which goes beyond the implementation of the Statsraad congress and his assumption to power. Contrary to many other factions, Jensen notes that the revolutionary struggle for the working class is an ongoing fight, and every Danish worker must be vigilant."
 DEN_idea_collaborative_community: "Collaborative Community"
 DEN_idea_collaborative_community_desc: "Richard Jensen's past shows how Denmark should become a wholly collaborative community which inspires each Danish citizen to remember their commitment to each other. The Danish state is built upon the idea that the sin of poverty must be abolished; we must look out for our fellow Dane and take care of each other."
 DEN_idea_fs_supremacy: "FS Supremacy"
 DEN_idea_fs_supremacy_desc: "The Union of Trade Unions, or the Fagoppositionens Sammenslutning, shall now be given the authority to govern every single trade union in Denmark. While revoking the independence of many trade unions has agitated many workers, Christian Christensen has assured that the FS will serve as a body to maintain and regulate the development of each trade union, ensuring equal opportunity and representation for the Danish worker."
 DEN_idea_industrial_freedom: "Industrial Freedom"
 DEN_idea_industrial_freedom_desc: "Many in the old guard of Enhedspartiet clamour about the lack of representation for all industries and regularly debate the inequalities when it comes to trade union representation across the country. By introducing new laws and regulations, to be governed and maintained by the FS, Christian Christensen has declared that by freeing Danish industry, so too shall its workers be free."
 DEN_idea_sexual_liberation: "Sexual Liberation"
 DEN_idea_sexual_liberation_desc: "Sexual liberation, at least in Denmark, has not made headway since its inception. Christian Christensen has declared that true sexual liberation should begin at once to tackle issues plaguing society."
 DEN_idea_revolutionary_springboard: "Revolutionary Springboard"
 DEN_idea_revolutionary_springboard_desc: "The Kommunarders have declared time and time again that Denmark is the perfect revolutionary springboard to export the revolution into the farther north of Scandinavia. Our comrades need support, even despite the setbacks of the Danish nation."
 DEN_idea_party_state_sycophancy: "Party State Sycophancy"
 DEN_idea_party_state_sycophancy_desc: "To achieve freedom for the Danish worker, one must become nothing more than a sycophant to the state and to the party. Only with devout loyalty and brave dedication can Denmark truly squash the reactionaries still enduring and resisting the Danish state. Regular purges and vivid anti-capitalist agitation are the means by which the Danish worker will free itself from the abhorrent system of the past."
 DEN_idea_scandinavian_arm: "Scandinavian Arm of the Revolution"
 DEN_idea_scandinavian_arm_desc: "The Danish army is lacking in more ways than one, and to truly combat nations abroad in Europe and across the world, the Danish army must greatly be expanded and modernised. Fortunately, advisors from France and Britain are arriving in droves for that exact reason."
 DEN_idea_reactionary_backlash: "Reactionary Backlash"
 DEN_idea_reactionary_backlash_desc: "Unsurprisingly, agitators from the Konservative Folkeparti, led by Jack Westergaard, have begun battles on the streets of Copenhagen. This has not only begun to destabilise our efforts to wrest control over the country, but has also forced a part of our army to disband to deal with this threat. While there is no threat of an active coup to restore the monarchy, efforts must be made to suppress these insurgents lest they force our revolution to collapse."
 DEN_idea_easy_eco_demand: "Moderate Economic Demands"
 DEN_idea_easy_eco_demand_desc: "Under pressure from the German ambassador, the Germans have required us to redirect trade mainly towards the German Empire, while also giving Germany preferential trade deals. While these demands will not entirely cripple or put a hefty strain on the Danish economy, it is still a nuisance that we must deal with in order to maintain sovereignty."
 DEN_idea_hard_eco_demand: "Hefty Economic Demands"
 DEN_idea_hard_eco_demand_desc: "Had it not been for the looming German invasion, Thorvald Stauning may have been thrown out of office for accepting such demands. This agreement signs away a quarter of Danish industry to aid in the construction of German war infrastructure, factories, and natural resource deposit extraction. The toll this places on the Danish economy is severe, but if it means Denmark will be able to maintain neutrality, then there is no choice."
 DEN_idea_alone_against_all: "Alone Against the World"
 DEN_idea_alone_against_all_desc: "Our decision to remain independent and stand against the tide of reactionaries and socialists alike has been a tough choice. The government is in the process of preparing a permanent and active draft as long as Denmark remains on the frontlines, having been reduced to one of the last free nations in Europe. Citizen militia, irregular formations, and the constant draft of service troops are being prepared as every Danish citizen steels themselves for an inevitable conflict, should the west or the east come to force our hand."
 DEN_idea_BOPA_intensity1: "BOPA Attacks"
 DEN_idea_BOPA_intensity1_desc: "The Danish Freedom Council, led by Børge Houmann, has intensified their efforts to disrupt the ongoing war effort and free Denmark of its chains bound towards the Kaiserreich. Having declared that Danish citizens are bound as subjects in chains to Germany, they will do anything to ensure that Denmark regains its freedom, even if the goal is to align with the Internationale to the west. Indirectly supported by the Kommunard faction of Føderationen, BOPA and the Freedom Council will be a serious thorn in our side.\n\nSettling this crisis will take a matter of either a concerted effort by the army or the police. The police, however, will not be able to totally quash this operation during the war."
 DEN_idea_army_in_neglect: "Army in Neglect"
 DEN_idea_army_in_neglect_desc: "The Danish army and the Danish defence system as a whole are afflicted by a lack of control in military leadership. A significant portion of the budget is initially deliberated in the Rigsdag and is overseen by the Minister of Defence. Recently, the foreign minister, Peter Munch, has continued to impede army developments in his pursuit of ultimately abolishing it. Consequently, while the government has the ability to allocate funds for projects without delay, the army is unable to maintain the optimal level of strength."
 DEN_idea_outdated_navy: "Outdated Navy"
 DEN_idea_outdated_navy_desc: "The Danish navy is made up of mainly older destroyers and submarines, and due to Denmark's middling naval budget and naval industry, there is little that can be produced besides screening vessels. Much of the fleet as it stands has been refitted to modern standards, but that does not display much aptitude for new design development. Our flagship, the Peder Skram, is a relic from before the Weltkrieg and is largely obsolete, a sister ship of the Herluf Trolle and Olfert Fischer, which have been sold for scrap amidst the disastrous cost to maintain them. Navy leadership is largely bent to the will of the state budget, which has been diverted towards other economic and social affairs."
 DEN_idea_pacifist_accord: "Pacifist Accord"
 DEN_idea_pacifist_accord_desc: "The Pacifist Accord, or the agreement for neutrality, particularly with Radikale Venstre Peter Munch, holds strong with general support from Socialdemokratiet and Radikale Venstre's coalition. The eventual end goal of demolishing the army and pursuing true neutrality at the behest of the coalition hamstrings any efforts for the government to militarise. The opposition and even King Christian X have decried that Denmark must remilitarise, citing the Syndicalist threats in Paris and London, but Socialdemokratiet and Radikale Venstre have been silent on the matter.\n\n§RThe moderate left coalition aims to pass a new demilitarisation bill come 1937, since it was denied several years ago. For now, remilitarisation will have severe costs, and conscription is disabled.§!"
 DEN_idea_pacifist_accord_partial: "Pacifist Accord - Partial"
 DEN_idea_pacifist_accord_partial_desc: "Many forms of the Pacifist Accord restrictions are in effect, but due to our efforts, Peter Munch is becoming convinced of our cause day by day."
 DEN_idea_pacifist_accord_diminished: "Pacifist Accord - Diminished"
 DEN_idea_pacifist_accord_diminished_desc: "Only a few restrictions remain on the army, and conscription being introduced is looking less and less likely to be vetoed by Radikale Venstre. Peter Munch has received significant support in negotiations and has all but acquiesced on the issue."
 DEN_idea_delaying_units: "Delaying Units"
 DEN_idea_delaying_units_desc: "Units of Irregular or Light Infantry have begun deployment following Erik With's plan to regularly staff the border with such units. While they are not fit for combat, the approximate time in which they may have to do battle with regular infantry, combat artillery bombardments, and even potentially engage in anti-tank warfare is highly likely. Thus, an expansion of training and developing strong irregular units will be essential to our army."
 DEN_idea_aerial_army: "Aerial Army"
 DEN_idea_aerial_army_desc: "Not only will Denmark expand its air force to contend with the rest of Scandinavia, it shall be a fighting force to be reckoned with. While our army may be reduced to a small, elite, mobile force, our air force shall strike fear into the hearts of anyone who dares challenge the balance of power in Europe. Therefore, Danish planes will be created with the idea that the air force is a second organised army, able to carry out both land and air assaults with supreme efficiency."
 DEN_idea_armour_experiments: "Armoured Experiments"
 DEN_idea_armour_experiments_desc: "As it stands, Denmark has little experience utilising armoured units in warfare, nor has it actively pursued such an endeavour due to the cost and inexperience with such pieces of technology. However, there has been success in studies within using armour in an infantry supporting role, so we have thus created limited armour units to support our troops on the battlefield."
 DEN_idea_developed_reserve: "Developed Reserve"
 DEN_idea_developed_reserve_desc: "The outright mobilisation of more of our populace is inefficient and will take a great deal of effort and strife. In lieu of the aforementioned strategy, we will implement a continuous mobilisation of our reserve forces, thereby ensuring the immediate availability of Danish troops to reinforce frontline troops in a prompt and efficient manner."
 DEN_idea_to_defend_danish_coasts: "To Defend Danish Coasts"
 DEN_idea_to_defend_danish_coasts_desc: "The Danish navy shall be repurposed into one filled with screens and will focus entirely on the production of highly advanced, cheap, and effective screening ships, such as submarines and destroyers. Utilising our strengths and diverting the necessary resources to the air force and army are a priority, so the navy will make do. Admiral Rechnitzer has signed off on the idea and will begin to divert production towards small ships over anything else."
 DEN_idea_beyond_danish_coasts: "Beyond Danish Coasts"
 DEN_idea_beyond_danish_coasts_desc: "The Danish fleet must project itself beyond the Danish coasts, and the utilisation of cruisers will do just that. What little capacity we have will be transferred towards the production of powerful cruisers, which will serve in the North Atlantic and aim to contest larger fleets on a budget. Though heavy ships and even naval aircraft will prove troublesome, creating a renewed Danish fleet is well within our interests."
 DEN_idea_developing_naval_theory: "Developing Naval Theory"
 DEN_idea_developing_naval_theory_desc: "Modernising the Danish fleet will require new textbooks and theory on how naval warfare is conducted in the modern age. Gone are the days of big gun supremacy and attempting to create a large ship with the largest rifles to quell the enemy line; tactics and techniques are constantly being developed in naval exercises."
 DEN_idea_pride_safeguarding: "Safeguarding our Pride"
 DEN_idea_pride_safeguarding_desc: "The pride of our fleet is sacred and many decry that it is left ultimately vulnerable in the face of enemy ships and planes alike. Admirals Rechnitzer and Vedel have differing plans on tackling this issue, though ultimately whichever plan is implemented shall aid our endeavours greatly."
 DEN_idea_ship_aa: "Ship-wide Anti-Air Improvements"
 DEN_idea_ship_aa_desc: "Improving the anti-air capabilities of mounted anti-air guns and emplacements will aid in our ships being able to fend off air from carrier-mounted planes or from the continent. Our proximity to bases in northern Germany, the Norwegian coast, and the English and French coasts mean that our ships may have to carry planes from nations alike, so we must be prepared for anything."
 DEN_idea_heavy_cruiser_spearhead: "Heavy Cruiser Spearhead"
 DEN_idea_heavy_cruiser_spearhead_desc: "The main focus of our naval prowess shall be utilising heavy cruisers; they are less costly than larger ships, while still maintaining some firepower. Their rifles may only be about 200mm compared to the average heavy ship of almost twice that, but against screens and lighter ships, their shells will do plenty to rain down hell."
 DEN_idea_naval_shellstorm: "Naval Shellstorm"
 DEN_idea_naval_shellstorm_desc: "Raining down shells from multiple ships at once of a decent calibre will be the way to go for combating enemy ships in the Baltic and North Atlantic. With enough range, we can catch the enemy off guard with a massive barrage, which will have them thinking twice about facing our fleets."
 DEN_idea_convoy_disruption: "Convoy Disruption"
 DEN_idea_convoy_disruption_desc: "Disrupting enemy convoys will prove fruitful in taking care of trade, troop transports, or transports of war materiel. This is especially beneficial to cut off Scandinavia from the west or perform limited operations in the Baltic Sea."
 DEN_idea_kings_mark: "Kongemærke"
 DEN_idea_kings_mark_desc: "The Kongemærke or King's Mark is a popular piece of memorabilia sold nationwide in support of the King's 70th birthday. This symbol of patriotism to Danish sovereignty and to King Christian X is only one measure of appreciation given out to the populace in order to raise money for the King Christian X Foundation. Thousands to hundreds of thousands are being sold nationwide in support of such an initiative."

 ## Eco Recovery Tree - Top
 DEN_black_monday: "Denmark in Crisis!"
 DEN_black_monday_desc: "The market crash of the Berlin Stock Exchange has crippled most sectors of the Danish economy. Fortunately, much of our economy is based on agriculture, meaning that by cleaning up the non-agricultural excesses, we could possibly contain the crisis with quick government intervention and the arrival of the harvesting season to revitalise the farming industry."
 DEN_save_landmandsbanken: "Save Landmandsbanken"
 DEN_save_landmandsbanken_desc: "Landmandsbanken, or the Farmers' Bank, is the largest bank in Denmark, and allowing it to sink could be absolutely devastating for the economy. By introducing strong government intervention and prioritising Landmandsbanken over other banks, capitalist finance can still be saved."
 DEN_prioritise_non_interference: "Prioritise Non-Interference"
 DEN_prioritise_non_interference_desc: "Liberal ideals quantify that the failure of major banks is a necessity, and forcing the government to shoulder the burden will lead to unchecked debts and terrible spending. By focusing our efforts on acting once the crisis has hit its lowest point, only then can economic recovery begin."
 DEN_negotiate_with_kf: "Negotiate with KF"
 DEN_negotiate_with_kf_desc: "The Konservative Folkeparti, or Conservative People's Party, is a minor party that still garners a large swing in the opposition under Venstre's coalition banner. Though our main talks are with Venstre, having sway with their coalition partner may prove fruitful, though it may upset our own coalition in doing so."
 DEN_positioning_krone: "Positioning the Krone"
 DEN_positioning_krone_desc: "Our present policy with regards to our currency, the Danish Krone, has been called into question in light of the immense depreciation of the German Mark. Both sides of parliament have argued for a more active approach to regulating the Krone's positioning on the foreign exchange market - and some for even more radical measures."
 DEN_looming_threat_of_worker_action: "The 'Looming Threat' of Worker Action"
 DEN_looming_threat_of_worker_action_desc: "The Dansk Arbejdsgiverforening, or 'Danish Employers' Association', warns our government that the ongoing economic crisis could plunge our country into a state of open revolution. They are asking us to move decisively to support the employers' right to end illegal strikes by any means necessary."
 DEN_bail_out_industries: "Bail Out Failing Industries"
 DEN_bail_out_industries_desc: "Industry is the greatest employer of our time, providing jobs for the greatest share of the population in Denmark. These companies failing and closing shop is not an option for us right now - having the workers go without salaries could not only worsen the current crisis but have them fall into the arms of extremist ideologues."
 DEN_avoid_bailouts: "Avoid Bailouts"
 DEN_avoid_bailouts_desc: "While a rise in unemployment may be the result of letting businesses fail, Venstre politicians have argued that the rise of new businesses in the place of failing ones is the true solution to the crisis. Should the government allow the free market to act, it will properly respond in time."
 DEN_create_valutacentralen: "Re-establish the Valutacentral"
 DEN_create_valutacentralen_desc: "The Valutacentral was a currency office within Danmarks Nationalbank which, from 1924 to 1926, monitored the size of private currency holdings and acted as the authority on the use of foreign currency. In doing so, it played a crucial role in helping Denmark re-establish the gold standard; and with our new plans for the Krone, its re-establishment will be of great aid."
 ## Eco Recovery Tree - Bottom
 DEN_kanslergaden: "Kanslergade Agreement"
 DEN_kanslergaden_desc: "Unfortunately, the Danish upper house, the 'Landsting', is controlled by the opposition, rendering the government's efforts without opposition support hamstrung. If we are to mount an effective response to the hardships caused by the economic crisis, we shall have to work with them: let us invite the opposition leaders to Stauning's apartment at Kanslergaden."
 ## Interventionism
 DEN_interventionist_economics: "Interventionist Economics"
 DEN_interventionist_economics_desc: "Theories on the benefits of state intervention in the economy have been promoted within German Social Democrat circles, most notably by Fritz Tarnow and Fritz Baade. Curbing the excesses of our banking sector, whose habits have got us into this mess to begin with, combined with a vast expansion of public works, should restart the heart of the Danish economy. After all, what works for Germany will surely work for us."
 DEN_crackdown_on_lockouts: "Crackdown on Lockouts"
 DEN_crackdown_on_lockouts_desc: "Memories of the pre-election strikes remain vivid, and many factory owners now employ entire security teams, ready to 'lock down' the factory at a moment's notice - which has already led to violent incidents against both legal strikers and entirely unrelated workers. This state of paranoia has gone on long enough, and we ought to sit down with the various employers' organisations of Denmark to discuss how to end this state of affairs."
 DEN_agreement_with_germany: "Bolster Trade Relations with Germany"
 DEN_agreement_with_germany_desc: "With Britain incinerating in the fires of revolution, Germany, and in a wider form Mitteleuropa, have become our main trading partners. However, our goods are too expensive in these markets. This could possibly be resolved by erasing the few trade limitations still in place and receiving permission to support our own farmers over Germans in return for other concessions."
 DEN_devalue_the_krona: "Inflation Control: Devalue the Krone"
 DEN_devalue_the_krona_desc: "Part of the problem is that Danish agricultural products are simply too expensive for the crisis-ridden Germans. By artificially lowering the value of the Krone in relation to the Mark, it will be cheaper for the German market to buy Danish produce compared to other agricultural options."
 DEN_public_works: "Public Works and Projects"
 DEN_public_works_desc: "By spending our money on public works, we can employ people who would otherwise be unemployed, which means they will have some money to spend, bringing life back into the market. As a cherry on top, we will also be able to improve our infrastructure at a relatively low cost."
 DEN_state_funded_industry: "State Funded Industrialisation"
 DEN_state_funded_industry_desc: "In the aftermath of the 'Black Monday' stock market crash, most people lost their savings, be it caused by the contraction of the economy or the failing stock prices. But the state has not, so it can still reactivate the economy, produce the tools and products people need, and create new jobs for all with a programme of rapid industrialisation and heavy investing."
 DEN_extended_unempl_subs: "Unemployment Benefits"
 DEN_extended_unempl_subs_desc: "Many in Denmark have found themselves to be unemployed as a result of the ongoing crisis. Earlier it would have been private insurance that would have taken this function, but the spike in unemployment has increased the premium to such a degree that few can still afford it. It is the government's duty to create a safety net."
 DEN_universal_healthcare: "Universal Healthcare"
 DEN_universal_healthcare_desc: "Ensuring the health of all is a primary objective of a Social Democratic state. Medicine has been historically expensive for the common worker, but with the funds the state has, it'd be feasible to construct newer hospitals and employ more medical personnel, using the increased size of the healthcare sector to procure more beneficial contracts with suppliers."
 ## Austerity & Foreign Investment
 DEN_madsen_mygdal_plan: "The Madsen-Mygdal Plan"
 DEN_madsen_mygdal_plan_desc: "Named after the leader of Venstre, Thomas Madsen-Mygdal, the Madsen-Mygdal plan calls for a reticent approach by the government, focusing on austerity and fiscal responsibility instead of the social democratic approach that is bound to just leave Denmark in debt."
 DEN_strengthening_investor_confidence: "Boost Investor Confidence"
 DEN_strengthening_investor_confidence_desc: "By supporting our companies and maintaining our balance, we shall show potential investors that Denmark is one of the safest countries to invest in, even in this turbulent time. The financial injection into the market that will hopefully follow shall help us carry ourselves out of the crisis in time."
 DEN_loan_to_danish_companies: "Loans to Danish Companies"
 DEN_loan_to_danish_companies_desc: "By giving loans directly from the treasury to Danish companies, we will be able to support them and allow them to bridge this time of economic uncertainty, hopefully mostly unscathed, despite the fact that some of the loans will likely never be paid back."
 DEN_strengthen_the_krona: "Inflation Control: Strengthen the Krone"
 DEN_strengthen_the_krona_desc: "By strengthening the backing of our currency and thus increasing its value, we will further emphasise the stable nature of the Danish economy. In addition, it will make imports cheaper, making many products more affordable to the common man."
 DEN_encourage_foreign_investment: "Encourage Foreign Investment"
 DEN_encourage_foreign_investment_desc: "We should encourage foreigners to invest in Denmark now that we have shown that this is a safe investment. With their investments, money will enter the Danish economy, which will help us recover from the crisis that hit us like a bus."
 DEN_austerity_measures: "Austerity Measures"
 DEN_austerity_measures_desc: "We cannot maintain the balance with taxes alone; at some point these taxes will simply have a negative effect on the economy and prolong its hardship. Therefore, it is important that we limit our expenses as well."
 DEN_encourage_unempl_insurance: "Private Unemployment Insurance"
 DEN_encourage_unempl_insurance_desc: "By supporting unemployment insurance, we can ensure that the premiums do not rise to such extremes as had been happening in the last months, without having to resort to undue government interference or expenses by giving subsidies ourselves. We should definitely support this business!"
 DEN_strengthen_mitteleuropa_ties: "Strengthen Mitteleuropa Ties"
 DEN_strengthen_mitteleuropa_ties_desc: "Though aligning with Germany economically may have been a bad move in hindsight, it was necessary a decade ago due to the collapse of Britain and France into syndicalist systems. This does not mean we should turn away from the German sphere - emboldening our support in Mitteleuropa will only prove fruitful for our economy in due time."
 DEN_beyond_mitteleuropa: "Beyond Mitteleuropa"
 DEN_beyond_mitteleuropa_desc: "For better or for worse, we have decided to bypass Mitteleuropa in favour of increasing trade deals with other countries. While economies across the world are feeling sluggish, whether it is due to the Great Depression in the Americas or the aftershocks of German influence, looking elsewhere will be for the best."
 ## Final Recovery
 DEN_tax_reorganisation: "Tax Reorganisation"
 DEN_tax_reorganisation_desc: "The current system of taxation in Denmark is fundamentally flawed, and while politicians from across the spectrum will argue on the specifics, there is a crisis on the line. Therefore, both sides have agreed on a compromise with the increase of both income tax and consumer taxes. This will pave the way for an influx of government funds to keep debt away and increase involvement through investments."
 DEN_recovery: "Crisis Declared Over!"
 DEN_recovery_desc: "Through our sound economic policy, Denmark has fully recovered from the economic crisis. With unemployment down and earnings as well as public confidence back at pre-crisis levels, few can argue that the government did a poor job dealing with the events that were."

 ## Eco Tree
 DEN_invest_in_maersk: "Invest in Maersk"
 DEN_invest_in_maersk_desc: "The Maersk company was founded in 1904 and has a strong presence across all Danish shipping. By investing in the company, we should be able to stimulate more trade by expanding the merchant fleet and infrastructure in the country."
 DEN_support_nordisk_film: "Support Nordisk Film"
 DEN_support_nordisk_film_desc: "Nordisk Film is one of the oldest cinema companies in the world. By investing in the company, they should be able to create more films - in particular those that support Denmark and its current government, increasing our public support as a result."
 DEN_reinvigorate_danish_cinema: "Reinvigorate Danish Cinema"
 DEN_reinvigorate_danish_cinema_desc: "Our support of the cinema seems to have worked stellarly. It's time that we expanded our operations, dedicating time and money to the advertisement of the great Danish cinema. We can also use this as a chance to headline a new movie about the ever-watchful Danish military protecting its people from harm."
 DEN_enlarge_industry: "Consumer Industry Expansion"
 DEN_enlarge_industry_desc: "With the revolutions in Britain and France, America's decline, and our position inside Mitteleuropa, Denmark has seen a sharp decline in the availability of basic consumer goods to most of our population. By increasing our basic industrial production, we can alleviate our deficit, if not remove it."
 DEN_Fyn_Development: "Funen Land Reform Project"
 DEN_Fyn_Development_desc: "Funen, while being the third-largest island in our country and in the centre of our nation, is almost completely agricultural and rural in nature. Through extensive land reform and deforestation, Funen will begin to industrialise to meet the remainder of Denmark."
 DEN_Jutland_Development: "Jutland Industrial Development"
 DEN_Jutland_Development_desc: "It's no secret that Danish industry is small compared to other countries, in part because of our size. While Zealand itself is very industrialised, Jutland still has plenty of room to exploit, so by sponsoring the construction of new factories, we should hopefully be able to increase industrial output in the region."
 DEN_Jutland_Highway: "Jutland Highway Project"
 DEN_Jutland_Highway_desc: "With the rise of industry in Jutland, it has found itself in need of more infrastructure to support it and the growing needs of the region. We shall dedicate time and money to expanding the already good infrastructure of the area to hopefully support our other efforts in the area."
 DEN_expand_kastrup: "Expand Kastrup"
 DEN_expand_kastrup_desc: "The Kastrup airport is still relatively new; however, it is pridefully considered the first civil airport in the world and as of recently has seen huge activity. With its large growth in popularity around the world, we should expand the airport to help accommodate the new demand that's grown for its services."
 DEN_improve_sjaelland_infra: "Improve Sjælland's Infrastructure"
 DEN_improve_sjaelland_infra_desc: "With new projects and expansions being sponsored around the country, attention has finally shifted to Zealand. The increase in economic activity and industry in the capital region needed to be improved to help with the shipping of goods and transportation to and from Jutland."
 DEN_support_the_tiftp: "Support the Institute for Theoretical Physics"
 DEN_support_the_tiftp_desc: "Founded in 1921, the Institute for Theoretical Physics of Copenhagen University is a beacon of science across Europe, spearheading research into atomic and quantum physics. Led by the famous Niels Bohr, most scientists in Europe have visited the institute to learn from Bohr and his studies. If we support the institute, hopefully they could expand their operations and conduct more high-quality tests."
 DEN_fund_the_copenhagen_university: "Fund the University of Copenhagen"
 DEN_fund_the_copenhagen_university_desc: "Much like the Institute of Theoretical Physics, the University of Copenhagen is a centre of knowledge and learning. By funding and supporting the university at large, they should be able to expand and take in more students, hopefully allowing more highly skilled scientists and engineers to come from their university and into Denmark."
 DEN_expand_belt_ferry: "Expand the Belt Ferry"
 DEN_expand_belt_ferry_desc: "The Great Belt Ferries connect the many islands of Zealand together and allow automobiles and trains to travel across the islands. However, there have been many complaints about the ferries, mostly due to the inability to handle the amount of traffic coming through. By expanding the ferries across Zealand and into Jutland, we should be able to help alleviate the demand that has formed and provide better access throughout our country."
 DEN_bridge_designs: "Designs for a Bridge"
 DEN_bridge_designs_desc: "With the growing issues of ferries, some people have been asking for bridges to connect Denmark together. However, we do not have the means to construct such a bridge, but it could be a better solution in the end. Hopefully, by sponsoring research into construction, we should be able to design a workable blueprint and methods for such bridges."
 DEN_Military_Industry: "Encourage Military Industry"
 DEN_Military_Industry_desc: "Once more it seems as if the fires of war will engulf Europe. In order to maintain independence, we must help develop a robust arms industry so our soldiers will always have the means to fight."

 DEN_danish_rearmament_programme: "Danish Rearmament Programme"
 DEN_danish_rearmament_programme_desc: "Our army is woefully out of date, without many standards of modern war like machine guns, and couldn't put up a fight if Denmark was invaded. In order to fix this issue, we shall begin to reform our army structure and bring it up to the standards of the 20th century so we may defend our country against foreign aggression."
 DEN_focus_on_defensive: "Focus on the Defensive"
 DEN_focus_on_defensive_desc: "Denmark has always been proud of its neutrality, and our small size would prevent any major military attacks against our enemies. To counter this, we shall focus on the defensive, constructing forts on our borders and developing new defensive tactics, while also reminding our soldiers that if war were to break out, they are the only thing standing between their country and its destruction."
 DEN_fortify_jutland: "Fortify Jutland"
 DEN_fortify_jutland_desc: "We shall move to strengthen our land border in Jutland. By utilising the narrow front, we should be able to put up an effective defence from an invasion by land, especially with further expansions in the years to come."
 DEN_fortress_sjaelland: "Fortress Sjælland"
 DEN_fortress_sjaelland_desc: "Sweden's shared neutrality may not always be maintained - therefore, equipping modern fortifications around Copenhagen will prove essential. We must endeavour to turn Sjælland into a fortress to repulse any possible invasion and to defend the heart of our country."
 DEN_fortress_fyn: "Fortify Fyn"
 DEN_fortress_fyn_desc: "Fyn is the stepping stone to both our capital and industrial heart. With fortifications placed at key strategic locations across the island, we can ensure that Sjælland will always remain out of reach until it falls."
 DEN_utilise_irregular_formations: "Utilise Irregular Formations"
 DEN_utilise_irregular_formations_desc: "General Erik With has championed an idea which would aid in making use of Denmark's limited manpower pool and industrial capacity. In case of a war on land, on the shores of Denmark, or through our border with Germany, deploying lighter infantry divisions or irregular infantry would do the trick to buy time and allow our main force to organise a traditional defence."
 DEN_artillery_improvements: "Artillery Improvements"
 DEN_artillery_improvements_desc: "The investments into both our artillery and defences have paid off, but are not yet complete. We have begun to provide our army with better firing tables and range finders - the efficacy of the army has never been higher."
 DEN_unwavering_morale: "Unwavering Morale"
 DEN_unwavering_morale_desc: "The propaganda being spread across the country and in the army has worked wonders. Many Danish men volunteer to join the army, and those in the army have unquestioning and unwavering support in the defence of our nation against foreign attacks."
 DEN_standardised_training: "Standardised Training"
 DEN_standardised_training_desc: "The idea of a standardised form of training for our army needs to be rethought and modernised towards this new modern era of warfare. Gone are the days when Denmark could rally regiments at the call of the King to engage the enemy - our standing army needs to be rigorously trained and reinforced for battle at all times, considering the state of the world and its trajectory."
 DEN_doctrinal_advancements: "Doctrinal Advancements"
 DEN_doctrinal_advancements_desc: "Denmark's main doctrine of warfare may be lagging behind our neighbours, and as such, we should purchase the latest textbooks in warfare and ensure our generals are rigorously studied on the new art of war. Marshal Prior will ensure his generalship equally has the means to fight toe to toe with the great powers, even should our army's size be lacking the might needed to face them."
 DEN_equipment_upgrades: "Equipment Modernisation"
 DEN_equipment_upgrades_desc: "For a long time, military breakthroughs were slow, and having a good bolt-action rifle was enough. However, these rifles of the 19th century are completely out of place on the post-Weltkrieg battlefield. We must stop being complacent and get new equipment."
 DEN_motorisation_focus: "Invest in Motorisation"
 DEN_motorisation_focus_desc: "While the rest of our army has undergone major reforms, logistics in the army have yet to be changed. By investing in motorisation, we can hasten logistics and also use them to quickly redeploy troops around the country in case of a naval invasion."
 DEN_legged_infantry: "Leg Infantry Shall Do!"
 DEN_legged_infantry_desc: "While some have been considering the idea of using motorisation for logistics and possibly a form of mechanised infantry, we believe that due to the size of our country, we can focus on improving our irregular infantry instead, with better supplies and tactics to make up for a less mobile force."
 DEN_unconventional_warfare: "Unconventional Warfare"
 DEN_unconventional_warfare_desc: "Denmark will never raise an army that is capable of challenging hegemonic powers like France and Germany, even to the extent of merely dissuading them from invading Denmark; our population is simply too small. We should invest in a specialised special force that will be able to strike anywhere."
 DEN_form_jaegerkorpset: "Form the Jægerkorps"
 DEN_form_jaegerkorpset_desc: "Jæger corps have existed in some form since 1785 as Denmark's elite special forces. By establishing an official Jægerkorpset command, we shall make anyone thinking about messing with Denmark think twice."
 DEN_reestablish_marineregimentet: "Reestablish the Marineregiment"
 DEN_reestablish_marineregimentet_desc: "By establishing special training for marine regiments, we can start recruiting specialised amphibious divisions that are capable of conducting extraction operations or preparing a larger invasion by securing a position on the ground."
 DEN_increased_reserve_units: "Increased Reserve Units"
 DEN_increased_reserve_units_desc: "The Danish frontline units and reserve units must be prepared for the course of modern warfare, and having an entrenched reserve capable of bringing fresh troops to the front around the clock is critical. Increasing the reserve and ensuring that plenty of trained, capable troops are available to fight should Denmark find itself at war is of utmost importance."
 DEN_offensive_air_efforts: "Offensive Air Efforts"
 DEN_offensive_air_efforts_desc: "Denmark shall project an air force capable of contesting foes around the clock, and by redistributing funds that were poorly allocated to other means and matters, enough funding will be able to bring Denmark a fleet of fighters, bombers, and even naval-based aircraft to aid in our contention with lacking industries. Through this, our elite force will no longer have to worry about keeping the skies clear with anti-air, as the Danish air force will fly day in and day out."
 DEN_more_special_forces: "Expanded Special Forces Training"
 DEN_more_special_forces_desc: "While the Danish army may be small, no one can claim they are not the best of the elite. By expanding our soldiers' training routines, they will both grow in size and gain the ability to truly operate in any condition."
 DEN_surprise_element: "The Element of Surprise"
 DEN_surprise_element_desc: "No one will expect the Danish army to thrive in conditions unbefitting of its size. By deploying tactics that will assist in maintaining a steady stream of supply, no matter where the army is stationed, we can catch our enemies off guard while they are at their weakest."
 DEN_armour_experiments: "Armour Experiments"
 DEN_armour_experiments_desc: "The Danish army is woefully behind the modern age of warfare due to its reliance solely on legged infantry, and while it will continue to make up the bulk of the Danish army, there is no reason not to experiment with some limited armour units in infantry support roles. While our native designs may be focused on sheer low production cost at the behest of reliability, these tools of warfare will no doubt be of use to us."
 DEN_home_air_defense: "Home Air Defence"
 DEN_home_air_defense_desc: "Denmark is highly susceptible to bombing from both the north and the south and by sea. While anti-air positions have been installed across key targets around the country, creating a limited air force to intercept bombers and keep our airspace clear will be a priority should we find ourselves the target of such tactics."
 DEN_support_on_the_battlefield: "Support on the Battlefield"
 DEN_support_on_the_battlefield_desc: "By investing in battlefield support planes, we can ensure that our troops will be properly supported by our air force on the battlefield, giving them a fighting edge in any battle where the conditions allow it. Light bombers may not have the firepower or the range, but they will cover needs for targets close to home, ensuring that we have the advantage on home turf at all times."
 DEN_invest_in_fighter: "Focus on Fighters"
 DEN_invest_in_fighter_desc: "If we fail to invest in fighters, we will soon find that our bombers will fail to reach their targets and that our skies will soon be ruled by the enemy instead. We should instead invest in agile fighter planes that will allow us to defend our sovereign airspace."
 DEN_rule_the_skies: "Secure Aerial Dominance"
 DEN_rule_the_skies_desc: "By sending our fighters into the air, we are clearly showing that we can defend our own airspace and operations. Therefore, we shall only truly rule our own skies when this objective has been properly completed."
 DEN_conventional_airforce: "Conventional Air Force"
 DEN_conventional_airforce_desc: "The difference in our two branches is rather unconventional. By bringing them more together, we can ensure that our aerial assets will be able to act with the same efficiency as other air forces, if not better."
 DEN_establish_flyvevabnet: "Establish the Flyvevåben"
 DEN_establish_flyvevabnet_desc: "We should unite the Hærens Flyvertroppen and the Marinens Flyvevæsen into a single new air force branch in our nation. The organisation of this new branch will bring an unprecedented reduction in bureaucracy and help secure our place as a country with a high-quality air force."
 DEN_expand_the_bomber_regiments: "Expand the Bomber Regiments"
 DEN_expand_the_bomber_regiments_desc: "Our army would be left astray if there were no suitable bombers to destroy enemy logistics positions, unleash strategic bombing, or carry out attacks on columns of infantry platoons or tank brigades. While there is little in the way of large bombers that can be produced, expanding the potential of light bombers to increase their output will work wonders."
 DEN_intensify_defenses: "Intensify Defences"
 DEN_intensify_defenses_desc: "Danish defence cannot solely rely on building land fortifications to create a static defence, which is why the utilisation of Danish railways to support mobile artillery bombardments, harrying forces around the clock, is a necessity. The creation of such railway artillery will prove useful in aiding our troops abroad, or in defending home territory."
 DEN_self_defense_fleet: "Self Defence Fleet"
 DEN_self_defense_fleet_desc: "The Danish fleet has gone largely underfunded for far too long, and Admiral Rechnitzer has agreed that something should be done. Under his plan, the budget needed for the navy would not be as drastic as once thought. The plan in mind is to create a fleet of screens which would aid in defending our shores, as well as escorting and raiding convoys that come in close proximity."
 DEN_seaworthy_fleet: "A Seaworthy Fleet"
 DEN_seaworthy_fleet_desc: "To reconfigure the Danish fleet to combat the German or British ones would be suicidal, but projecting power beyond our coasts towards the Baltic Sea or the North Atlantic would prove to aid in solidifying Danish naval prowess once again. With careful budget increases, Danish dockyards will start to produce cruisers, both light and heavy, at an all-time rate, filling the role of combat vessels for our use."
 DEN_modernize_Sovaernet: "Modernise the Søværn"
 DEN_modernize_Sovaernet_desc: "The Danish navy, Søværnet, has not been updated in a while, yet it becomes ever more necessary because of the rising global tension. We should invest in the modernisation of our ships and perhaps pursue the construction of new vessels in order to maintain the integrity of our territorial waters."
 DEN_proper_surface_fleet: "A Proper Surface Fleet"
 DEN_proper_surface_fleet_desc: "The Danish fleet needs to operate properly at the surface level; otherwise, we will not be able to compare with the enemy. A fleet not focused on destroying the enemy fleet will intimidate or deter no potential foe from invading Denmark."
 DEN_modern_naval_warfare: "Modern Naval Warfare"
 DEN_modern_naval_warfare_desc: "Ingenious investment by our admirals has led to the Danish fleet engaging in tactics that come toe to toe with the British or German seafaring fleets. While we have a long way to go, considering our limited history in naval warfare, applying techniques our admirals have learned on the high seas alongside studies will herald successes to come."
 DEN_proper_screening: "Safeguard the Pride of Our Navy"
 DEN_proper_screening_desc: "Our new vessel is the pride of our navy and must be nurtured: imagine the morale hit if something were to happen to it. Fortunately, the existing Danish navy, composed of smaller ships, is available to defend our pride, but reinforcing their numbers can never hurt."
 DEN_fleet_armament: "Fleet Armament"
 DEN_fleet_armament_desc: "At present, dockyard capacity is minimal, and creating new designs is quite difficult due to a lack of naval experience in recent decades. Thus, Admiral Rechnitzer has facilitated the creation of new designs which will see a drastic improvement in our capabilities while also being within the realm of production. Scrapping older designs and refocusing dockyard capacity will have these ships in the water in no time."
 DEN_anti_air_improvements: "Anti-Air Improvements"
 DEN_anti_air_improvements_desc: "Naval bombers, fighters, and general bombing runs of our ships will become a serious issue should we hope to prepare our navy to fight, whether it is across the sea or to defend Denmark proper. While our own air force is lacking, and land placements of anti-air will aid ships in port, ships operating near enemy coasts will require drastic improvements in anti-air capabilities."
 DEN_fleet_bulwark: "Bulwark of the Fleet"
 DEN_fleet_bulwark_desc: "Our fleet will have a mix of combatant and non-combatant ships, as any fleet does. However, creating a true bulwark for our fleet to follow is an important step. Naval staff will work closely with the Admiralty in outlining the exact doctrine our navy will follow in order to streamline the efficiency of our fleet."
 DEN_battle_ready_fleet: "Battle Ready Fleet"
 DEN_battle_ready_fleet_desc: "Once war begins, our fleet will need to be ready to react around the clock and serve within hundreds of kilometres of our shores effectively and efficiently - this applies to our naval staff as well. By ensuring that every ship is properly battle-ready, with trained seamen and properly loaded ships with all the required fuel and ammunition, we will not be caught off guard by the professional navies of our major neighbours."
 DEN_danish_way_of_warfare: "Danish Way of Warfare"
 DEN_danish_way_of_warfare_desc: "Our native-born and bred naval tactics, even if influenced by the Great Powers of our time, will prove fundamental for decades to come. The Danish way of warfare may not be as unique or critically solely found in Denmark, but patriotism goes hand in hand with combat efficiency, and all will soon know of the unique Danish prowess for ingenuity and invention."
 DEN_danish_admiralty: "Danish Admiralty"
 DEN_danish_admiralty_desc: "The Danish Admiralty has come a long way since the start of the century, and while our limited prowess has disallowed the advancement of other higher-ranking naval officers, credit must be given to Aage Helgesen Vedel and Hjalmar Rechnitzer for their efforts in rearming and modernising the Danish navy. Their tactics, techniques, and studies have paid off; Denmark's admiralty is as well versed as the ships it can steer."

 DEN_constitutional_crisis_desc: "The desire to amend the Danish constitution in favour of the wishes of [GetSecondInCommand] has been interrupted by the illegitimate scheming of our king. With no choice but to deal with this unfortunate set of circumstances, Denmark's future hangs on the precipice. Radical forces could overturn our precious democracy, or the king could finally have his way and appoint a government of his liking - only time will tell."

 DEN_kings_cabinet_desc: "It is the king's right, no, duty by the constitution to protect the Danish people when their democratic government is about to make a mistake that will destroy the nation. If Germany were to be defeated, Denmark would find itself doomed to fall to the zealots in France and Britain - everyone knows they will come here to subject the Danes to syndicalist tyranny!"

 DEN_rearm_danish_industry: "Rearm Danish Industry"
 DEN_rearm_danish_industry_desc: "One major issue in the cause of preparing Denmark for war is its industry. Plenty of factories need to be retooled and reconfigured after the successful recovery from the economic crisis, and put to better use creating munitions for the army."
 DEN_appeal_to_our_powerbase: "Appeal to Our Powerbase"
 DEN_appeal_to_our_powerbase_desc: "Many in the KF have felt disillusioned since the collapse of its predecessor parties during the first Weltkrieg. In order to maintain our popular rule, we must look towards appealing to those that supported our predecessors, as well as those who see KF as the future of Denmark."
 DEN_reinvest_in_the_army: "Reinvest in the Hæren"
 DEN_reinvest_in_the_army_desc: "The Hæren, or the Royal Danish Army, has seen its ranks diminished during these many decades of prolonged peace. With war on the horizon, we must drastically expand recruitment and dedicate key resources to encourage enlistment."
 DEN_pursue_unicameralism: "Pursue Unicameralism"
 DEN_pursue_unicameralism_desc: "Unicameralism is a long-time goal of both Møller and the KF as a whole. Møller's dream of pursuing true parliamentary democracy in Denmark can wait no longer, and passing such a referendum will go a long way in legitimising the KF to the people of Denmark."
 DEN_sideline_parliament: "Sideline Parliament"
 DEN_sideline_parliament_desc: "The Rigsdag, or the current bicameral parliament of Denmark, has long been a thorn in the side of many in the autocratic wing of the KF, but especially Westergaard. Bypassing such a key tenet of Danish democracy will be nearly impossible... though should an occasion arise, Westergaard will surely take advantage of it."
 DEN_subdue_the_opposition: "Subdue the Opposition"
 DEN_subdue_the_opposition_desc: "With our rule secure for the near future, it is finally time to crack down on the opposition, which has started country-wide riots in protest of the cabinet's actions. The king has utilised his rightful powers, and our rule is just - all that is left is to silence them."
 DEN_invest_in_the_funktionaerer: "Invest in the Funktionærer"
 DEN_invest_in_the_funktionaerer_desc: "The Funktionærer are the lifeblood of our voter base, made up of mostly middle-class workers across Denmark such as business clerks. By reinvesting into that which propels our support, we can see decades of continued KF rule to allow true Danish prosperity."
 DEN_enforced_constitutionalism: "Enforced Constitutionalism"
 DEN_enforced_constitutionalism_desc: "Enforcing the constitution to its full effect will renew faith in our government, which has been quite unpopular after King Christian X appointed us following the fall of the Madsen-Mygdal cabinet. Furthermore, restoring the KF-Venstre coalition will help us maintain a majority in parliament for years to come."
 DEN_danish_trade_protectionism: "Danish Trade Protectionism"
 DEN_danish_trade_protectionism_desc: "Protecting the Danish markets is one of our main concerns, as they were interfered with during the recovery from the devastating economic crisis many years ago. Austerity may have saved the Danish economy, but the mistakes of Stauning's economic policy should be corrected."
 DEN_empower_the_konservative_ungdom: "Empower the Konservative Ungdom"
 DEN_empower_the_konservative_ungdom_desc: "The ranks of the KU have increased dramatically following Westergaard's rise to power, and he is now allowing members to enlist in the army. The brave young men joining Danish ranks will both bolster the front and add a degree of loyalty to our troops."
 DEN_increased_executive_power: "Increased Executive Power"
 DEN_increased_executive_power_desc: "Westergaard does not hold total power over the country, but this can be alleviated slowly through the passing of several laws to further bolster his rule. Westergaard is constantly frustrated by the moderates in the KF as well as the King's wishes, but this will not stop him from ensuring Danish democracy stays crippled indefinitely."
 DEN_right_wing_coalition: "Right-Wing Coalition"
 DEN_right_wing_coalition_desc: "Westergaard's ideology suits the radical wings of the KF, but to ensure their government does not collapse, Westergaard has announced cooperation with the DS and DKF. Max Arildskov has lukewarmly pledged support, while the DS has pledged its full support for Westergaard's government. A broad right-wing coalition will aid in stabilising the country and legitimising Westergaard's rule."

We should emphasise that we only have the best intentions and that loyalty is in their best interest."
 DEN_secure_military_loyalty: "Secure Military Loyalty"
 DEN_secure_military_loyalty_desc: "We need to ensure that the Danish Hær supports our actions, lest they side with the Rigsdag in this dispute and force us to comply.

 DEN_restore_democracy_question: "Restore Democracy?"
 DEN_restore_democracy_question_desc: "The question has arisen now that Denmark finds itself at peace whether or not democracy should be reinstated following the collapse of Thorvald Stauning's government in the face of the constitutional crisis. King Christian X appointed a suitable prime minister to rule, so it is by his decree whether or not he shall restore free democracy or simply continue this single-party rule."

 DEN_increased_recruitment: "Increased Recruitment"
 DEN_increased_recruitment_desc: "In order to maintain Denmark's fighting force, the king has ordered his citizens to further enlist in the armed forces. Denmark's smaller population leaves little room to expand our army further, but the king will ensure that the Danish army will be a force to be reckoned with. Unfortunately, expanding conscription to such an extent will put a strain on our industrial capacity."
 DEN_reichspakt_cooperation: "Reichspakt Cooperation"
 DEN_reichspakt_cooperation_desc: "Following agreements with the German Kaiser, the Danish Hær shall receive some much-needed up-to-date German rifles to bolster our armed forces.

This military and industrial aid is exactly what Denmark needs to aid Germany in their fight."
 DEN_danish_panzer_corps: "Danish Panzer Corps"
 DEN_danish_panzer_corps_desc: "Starting today, Germany has approved the rollout of reserve light tanks and motorised equipment, which will allow for the creation of the first-ever Danish panzer corps. While our army is woefully inept at utilising these divisions to their maximum capacity, there is no question that Denmark needs more than just legged infantry to aid in upcoming battles.

 DEN_develop_welfare_state_desc: "To further develop the Danish Welfare State, proposals have been made to increase the berth of public works projects which were enacted to aid in economic recovery. While Denmark does not suffer from its initial loss in jobs and unemployment, increasing funding towards these types of projects will bolster the strength of Danish industries and make sure every family with a working man has a job."

 DEN_matter_of_militarisation: "Matter of Militarisation"
 DEN_matter_of_militarisation_desc: "A contentious issue within the two parties that make up this coalition is how to handle the ever-present issue of militarisation. The world is heating up, and even if the major powers have avoided conflict, a second world war seems increasingly likely. As such, whether or not Denmark throws its hat into the ring, the antimilitarist elements of each party should be appeased, or at worst, expelled in order for Denmark to survive."
 DEN_welfare_bureaucracy: "New Welfare Bureaucracy"

 DEN_halted_reforms_desc: "Socialdemokratiet has gone too far, the state budget has collapsed into the red and rampant spending has further diminished the lives of Danish citizens across Denmark. These so-called welfare reforms, as well K.K. Steincke's New Social Laws, have brought nothing but unrest and unease - Denmark shall receive reform at a steady pace, so the brakes must be applied before Denmark spirals into an accident."

 DEN_venstre_denmark: "Right-Liberal Denmark"
 DEN_venstre_denmark_desc: "Venstre has survived the constitutional crisis, and now a question arises: with whom shall we continue to govern? The conservative KF has been our natural ally, but the now disgraced Socialdemokratiet has lost an ally in Radikale Venstre. Some in our party are proposing a reconciliation of the liberals, but that may be too radical of an idea."
 DEN_maintain_kf_coalition: "Maintain the KF Coalition"
 DEN_maintain_kf_coalition_desc: "The Konservative Folkeparti are our natural allies, and appeasing their demands for rearmament and further recruitment to expand our army can be dealt with easily. It will upset those in our party hoping to sit out future conflicts, but this is a sacrifice we are willing to make to survive the next election."
 DEN_reconcile_radicals: "Reconcile with Radikale Venstre"
 DEN_reconcile_radicals_desc: "A controversial offer has been made to Radikale Venstre to restore the liberal coalition, made slightly ironic by the fact that our two parties originally were one. There have been no plans to reconstruct Det Forenede Venstre thus far, but their support could prove useful, though it will alienate our former partners in the KF."
 DEN_moderated_rearmament: "Moderated Rearmament"
 DEN_moderated_rearmament_desc: "To continue our generous agreement with the KF, they have demanded that we continue some form of rearmament. By diverting some of our industrial output towards the construction of new war materiel, we will be able to meet the demands of our coalition partners, and in turn, their support for the Venstre-KF coalition will be cemented."
 DEN_limited_labour_reforms: "Limited Labour Reforms"
 DEN_limited_labour_reforms_desc: "The introduction of a subset of labour reforms, spearheaded by Radikale Venstre ideologue Peter Munch, will no doubt cause some measure of unrest across the party. However, by limiting the scale and expenditure of these reforms, we can both appease the majority of Venstre supporters while also maintaining this newfound liberal coalition."
 DEN_venstre_survives: "Venstre Survives"
 DEN_venstre_survives_desc: "The art of compromise and negotiation is as old as time itself, and whether through ventures with the conservative KF or new ventures with Radikale Venstre, Venstre itself will thrive for the near future. While the semblance of our continued governance is reliant on the support of the right or left in a coalition, Venstre will nevertheless continue its hold in Denmark."
 DEN_appeal_to_farmers: "Appeal to Farmers"
 DEN_appeal_to_farmers_desc: "Our traditional voter base in the Danish farmers has been in decline since the rise of industrialisation and the push for urbanisation across modern Denmark. However, our agrarian sector is still thriving and will continue to support us should we make some serious agricultural investments."
 DEN_resumed_recruitment: "Resumed Recruitment"
 DEN_resumed_recruitment_desc: "Resuming recruitment to outfit an army befitting of Denmark is no easy task, especially due to Danish inexperience in the ways of modern warfare. One thing is certain, however: expanding our ranks will do wonders for military campaigns across Europe and aid our allies towards victory."
 DEN_unity_propaganda: "Unity Propaganda"
 DEN_unity_propaganda_desc: "Ensuring that the whole of Denmark is united behind the idea of opposing the dangerous forces of Russia and the Internationale will take a significant amount of effort to execute. We will hold rallies across the country and hang posters in every major city centre to ensure that every good Danish citizen is motivated to enlist or aid in the war effort in other ways."
 DEN_centre_right_dominance: "Centre-Right Dominance"
 DEN_centre_right_dominance_desc: "The KF and Venstre coalition now dominates the political landscape of Denmark, having been ushered in after King Christian X decided to push for greater Danish involvement in European affairs. The coalition's continued tenure will ensure the freedoms of each Danish citizen are protected, and that Denmark will not fall to radicalism."
 DEN_push_to_equality: "Push to Equality"
 DEN_push_to_equality_desc: "The push towards equality will be a hard-fought and tenuous battle, especially among those in Venstre who still hold disdain towards Radikale Venstre for their conformity to labour reforms and upholding more rights for the Danish peoples. Reining in the far reaches of the party will be for the best, while modifying our reforms to suit this coalition will ensure that Danish liberalism can continue to endure."
 DEN_rehabilitate_antimilitarists: "Rehabilitate Antimilitarists"
 DEN_rehabilitate_antimilitarists_desc: "A campaign to rehabilitate with the far-reaching left wings of Radikale Venstre will prove to be an arduous task, especially as our alignment with the German sphere alone has caused Radikale Venstre itself to nearly shatter in two. By providing concessions towards wayward supporters of Radikale Venstre, and proving that modern military reform will only ensure Danish peace in the future, we can bring them to our side."
 DEN_reunite_liberals_question: "Future of Danish Liberalism"
 DEN_reunite_liberals_question_desc: "The future of Danish Liberalism will be settled through extensive negotiations between Venstre leadership and those in Radikale Venstre. The restored coalition between the two parties has ushered in a force in politics not seen for several decades, but acquiescing to the demands of the likes of Peter Munch does not come easily."
 DEN_pure_democracy: "Pure Democracy"
 DEN_pure_democracy_desc: "In times of trouble, we must remember 'Samfundssind' - the idea of community-mindedness and solidarity for one another. Tensions in the world are bubbling and the proud Danish country may not be able to stand at the sidelines for much longer. It is necessary for every good Danish citizen to stand for the pure democracy which has been reinforced throughout the decades."
 DEN_entrenched_rights: "Entrenched Rights"
 DEN_entrenched_rights_desc: "The rights of every Danish citizen must be upheld to the greatest extent, and its reinforcement only solidifies what it means to be Danish. Our brave country has survived thick and thin, and will continue to do so provided that the leadership maintains this level of deepened ties with its citizens."
 DEN_defend_our_democracy: "Defend Our Democracy"
 DEN_defend_our_democracy_desc: "Defending Danish democracy will undergo undue strain on the Danish workforce or on the Danish armed forces, so we must choose wisely where to divert our efforts. Only through intelligent planning shall we succeed in our goals, and faltering to do so will only inhibit the will of our state."

 DEN_the_first_statsraad_congress_desc: "Finally, the time has come to call the first ever Statsraad Congress, a tenuous union between socialist reform and Thorvald Stauning's attempts at pluralism. A much more socialist wind shall now blow through Denmark, but the varying factions within Føderationen have entirely separate goals for the future of Denmark, and this congress will decide the fate of our nation."
 ## radical socialist
 DEN_true_danish_socialism: "True Danish Socialism"
 DEN_true_danish_socialism_desc: "Føderationen-DVSP has won in the latest congress, with Aksel Larsen being swept in as Denmark's first Prime Minister-President. His visions for Denmark collide with the Føderationen-Enhedspartiet, as Larsen has denounced the influence of the trade union movement. Socialism cannot be brought to Denmark through importing revolutionary ideals from our comrades - we must spread the roots ourselves so that Denmark will flourish in the coming years."
 DEN_councilist_destiny: "Councilist Destiny"
 DEN_councilist_destiny_desc: "The destiny for Denmark, prescribed by the DVSP, is one akin to workers' councils. While this concept is not entirely new and many have accused Aksel Larsen of betraying his ideals of a truly Danish socialism, his response is that workers' councils are merely a tool to achieve the end goal. Councils will be a means in which every worker across the spectrum will be encompassed and is the only way that the Danish worker can truly find representation."
 DEN_socialism_untouched_by_foreign_influence: "Socialism Untouched by Foreign Influence"
 DEN_socialism_untouched_by_foreign_influence_desc: "Larsen has decried, as to not let Denmark become another pawn of French or British influence, that Denmark shall steer its own course. The Danish spirit is all-encompassing and powerful, nationalist but also truly free and unable to be broken by no matter the source. Let the foreign-backed Komminarder clique denounce us - Danish socialism will remain Danish."
 DEN_crush_trade_union_monopoly: "Crush Trade Union Monopoly"
 DEN_crush_trade_union_monopoly_desc: "The Danish plan to accompany a strong party-state with workers' councils will first need the absolution of the trade union dominance, especially within the party. Many have fallen prey to the lies spoken by Enhedspartiet leader Christian Christensen and their strong trade unionist ties, which will only lead to the oppression of the Danish worker. This will not stand, and the monopoly of trade unions across the country will be disfigured and dismantled immediately."
 DEN_danish_mass_party: "Danish Mass Party"
 DEN_danish_mass_party_desc: "The DVSP, while a party in its own right, has submitted its independence to the coalescing Føderationen. While our alliance is paramount and the means by which Denmark can continue as a socialist nation, it is fair to accept that our comrades must be sidelined in the face of achieving a true mass party which will encompass the entirety of workers across the spectrum."
 DEN_end_rural_urban_divide: "End Rural Urban Divide"
 DEN_end_rural_urban_divide_desc: "One of Larsen's plans to truly unite the Danish workers across the country is to end the rural and urban divide which has been plaguing the nation since the inception of industrialisation. Everyone in Denmark shall embrace the industrial and agricultural programme plans which will change the landscape of the country, brimming with jobs and opportunities."

 DEN_enhedspartiet_wins_desc: "'Enhedspartiet', or the Solidarity Party, has triumphed within the first ever election to the Statsraad Congress. Divided between the Young Guard led by Richard Jensen and the Old Guard led by Christian Christensen, it is agreed that the trade union monopoly of the former Fagoppositionens Sammenslutning will take prominence in Denmark."
 DEN_solve_party_schism: "Solve Party Schisms"
 DEN_solve_party_schism_desc: "Since the victory in the Statsraad Congress, the question of who should become Prime Minister-President is still up for debate, and Enhedspartiet is coming to a vote to decide on their leader. On one hand sits Richard Jensen, a vibrant agitator and chairman of Søfyrbødernes Forbund, and on the other sits longtime FS leader Christian Christensen, and both are close in the running to becoming the leader of Enhedspartiet and Denmark."
 DEN_growing_rhubarbs_aplenty: "Growing Rhubarbs Aplenty"
 DEN_growing_rhubarbs_aplenty_desc: "The title of Christian Christensen's yet unpublished and unfinished memoirs goes into detail about his youth and his upbringing in the countryside, where his family worked as farmers. Christensen calls on all citizens of Denmark to yearn to rise up and answer the call when their home is under threat; those in poverty should not sit still when it is them and their families' livelihood under oppression."
 DEN_danish_workers_first: "Danish Workers First"
 DEN_danish_workers_first_desc: "Christian Christensen has long decried the divide between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat in Denmark and has declared that in all measure of wit and will, the Danish worker will come first, and nothing shall stop progress. His commitment to the cause of the workers being ushered into regional trade unions governed by the FS will trounce any and all opposition and coalesce the pureness in the Danish working class."
 DEN_no_industry_untouched: "No Industry Untouched"
 DEN_no_industry_untouched_desc: "One of the founding fathers of Danish syndicalism, Christian Christensen has long advocated to end the divide when it comes to the treatment of industries across Denmark. Many had fled from the rural countryside to work in the city due to the betterment of conditions for urban workers, but for a long time, our rural workers have felt the struggle. Therefore, no industry will go untouched, and every Danish worker, no matter where they reside, shall receive better treatment."
 DEN_sexual_liberation: "Sexual Liberation"
 DEN_sexual_liberation_desc: "Further developing on the prevalent theme of the past few decades in regard to sexual liberation, and attempting to implement much of what was in Christian Christensen's book Arbejderne og børneflokken, Denmark shall spearhead the movement for sexual liberation in Scandinavia. Arbejderne og børneflokken was the first book to tackle this subject in Denmark, and Christensen has made it clear that it is bar none a controversial and important topic, which we should not ignore."
 DEN_exemplary_trade_union_power: "Exemplary Trade Union Power"
 DEN_exemplary_trade_union_power_desc: "Coalesced around the Fagoppositionens Sammenslutning, the Union of Trade Unions, Christensen has long advocated in the fight for Solidarity alongside his syndicalist comrades in Enhedspartiet with the idea of trade union supremacy. The party is at the behest of the trade unions, governed and managed by the executive FS in a manner in which every worker gains guidance and purpose throughout Denmark."
 DEN_reconcile_old_guard: "Reconcile the Old Guard"
 DEN_reconcile_old_guard_desc: "Much of the old guard, friends and allies of Christian Christensen, have supported his rise to power since as early as the turn of the century and should be rewarded as such. Positions in the FS will be handed out both based on competency and loyalty to the cause, so appeasing much of the old guard in Enhedspartiet will be most beneficial to support for our faction."
 DEN_reformed_union_bureaucracy: "Reformed Union Bureaucracy"
 DEN_reformed_union_bureaucracy_desc: "The reformed union bureaucracy under the FS will serve as a guiding hand to the entirety of Denmark, moving to finalise and polish the structure as it exists already. The Danish citizenry can breathe a sigh of relief and continue to work and relish in their goodwill now that the trade union bureaucracy has been reformed and refitted to efficiently serve Danish needs."
 DEN_everyone_to_par: "Everyone to Par"
 DEN_everyone_to_par_desc: "Much like Christian Christensen, Richard Jensen had an impoverished youth, and has declared in a speech following his election that everyone in Denmark will be brought up to par. The chains that bind some in the working class to poverty while others enjoy lavishly will not come to pass, and every Danish citizen will enjoy equal rights when it comes to liberty, freedom, and the ability to live comfortably."
 DEN_fuel_to_the_fire: "Fuel to the Fire"
 DEN_fuel_to_the_fire_desc: "Richard Jensen has long declared that the revolution is not over with the abolishment of the monarchy and much of the structure of the old bourgeoisie constitution being signed away. No, there is much to go to achieve true equality and true freedom for the Danish worker, and to do so, we must arm ourselves and equip ourselves to fight the constant revolutionary battle."
 DEN_empower_sofyrboderne_forbund: "Empower Søfyrbødernes Forbund"
 DEN_empower_sofyrboderne_forbund_desc: "Søfyrbødernes Forbund is the shipping association in which Prime Minister-President Richard Jensen became chairman of at the age of 25, and so it shall be empowered so that loyal sailors can finally achieve the retribution of the hard work invested in them, that they've slaved away at for decades. The association shall provide fairer wages, especially to our brave sailors, as they are the lifeblood towards an industry long neglected by the Danish government."
 DEN_help_each_dane: "Help Each Dane"
 DEN_help_each_dane_desc: "Richard Jensen calls on the people of Denmark to look out for each other; the revolutionary struggle will not entirely engulf the men, women, and children who bravely rally to its cause. However, much of Denmark still remains unemployed or impoverished after the horrifying economic downturn many years ago, and Richard Jensen shall not stand for this. To create a community in which every Dane helps each and every other Dane, only then shall Denmark find greatness."
 DEN_constant_revolutionary_struggle: "Constant Revolutionary Struggle"
 DEN_constant_revolutionary_struggle_desc: "Denmark may be a small country with a limited population and an industry that is not as representative as it is in France or Britain, but the struggle has not and will not end, especially as many other nations seek to retribute the abolition of our monarch. As is the case, procuring arms and conscripting men to fuel the fight is a necessity, and our citizens will feel the effects of our efforts for decades to come."
 DEN_sailor_socialism: "Sailor Socialism"
 DEN_sailor_socialism_desc: "The sailors that manage every ship perform hard and hot work, shovelling coals day in and day out to let each ship navigate their course.

Børge Houmann, leader of BOPA (Civilian Partisans), is the primary successor, but perhaps the old caretaker isn't ready to retire just yet. The Kommunard victory ushers in a displeasing leadership, bound for mobilising Denmark for an immediate war and to act as the Internationale's arm in the north."

 DEN_kommunard_caretaker_reigns_desc: "Surprisingly, the old caretaker, Martin Andersen Nexø, has decided not to retire and shall continue to lead the Kommunarder clique for the years to follow. The wisdom he brings with his age is welcomed, and his presence is well-liked by much of the party. The author of the well-received and well-read book Pelle Erobreren, Nexø is a popular figure within the party and leads a cadre of younger communists. He is both able and ready to guide Denmark to greatness."

The leader of BOPA (Civilian Partisans), Houmann has big shoes to fill now that Nexø has retired. His deputy, Alfred Jensen, has taken over BOPA in his absence, with the goal of transforming Denmark into a nation ready for war."
 DEN_springboard_of_revolution: "Springboard of Revolution"
 DEN_springboard_of_revolution_desc: "Denmark should, in essence, become a springboard for the revolution into the north, and especially with easily accessible striking positions into the south. While the border with Germany remains tenuous and easy for Denmark to collapse should German panzers approach, control over the straits will provide the Internationale with possible invasion angles across the entirety of the north German coast."
 DEN_foster_next_generation: "Foster the Next Generation"
 DEN_foster_next_generation_desc: "Many in the Kommunarder Clique have a strong tenet of fostering the younger generation; Nexø is especially particular in following in the footsteps of the revolutions in Britain and France and raising the next generation properly so they shall lead us free of corruption and sin. France and Britain represent the 'Socialist Dream' that he has affectionately labelled, though other veteran party members in Føderationen have mocked his idealism."
 DEN_undisputed_internationale_loyalty: "Undisputed Internationale Loyalty"
 DEN_undisputed_internationale_loyalty_desc: "Denmark must profess a strong loyalty to the Internationale; without France nor Britain, there would be no free Denmark, and Denmark will do service to ensure that the Internationale leadership knows truly of Denmark's proud loyalty. The Danish army shall have the strength and devotion of French soldiers, as well as the cunning and ingenuity of the British, crafting a newer and better Danish armed forces."

 DEN_import_revolutionary_ideals_desc: "Denmark is a fledgling country, having only found its calling after recent heinous acts have led the brave Thorvald Stauning to force King Christian X to abdicate once and for all. Knowing this, Denmark relies heavily on the Internationale's ideals for world revolution and should embrace what France and Britain have taught us. We have come far, but the struggle to liberate our neighbours is an endless and arduous goal, so we must not lose ourselves and forget the path to victory."

 DEN_decimate_reactionary_traitors_desc: "Festering in the midst of major cities, we must call for the arrest and disentanglement of major political leaders from power. It is not enough to declare them a part of the 'official opposition.' This shows weakness on the part of the revolution, and important figures leading the constitutionalist and autocratic wings of KF, as well as Venstre, shall be imprisoned posthaste."

 DEN_first_domino_of_many_desc: "Denmark is the first domino to fall, perhaps in Scandinavia and perhaps in such close proximity to Germany. We are the first nation directly fostered with leadership close to France and Britain and will serve as an example that the syndicalist ideals of France and Britain are here to stay and shall spread beyond our borders.

 DEN_state_subverted_socialism_desc: "The actions of the workers, the people of Denmark, shall be subverted not only to the state but to socialism in its purest form. The Kommunarder Clique may not be as overwhelming of a force as the Maximists in Britain to serve as a vanguard for the revolution, but in name alone, that shall be the goal.

 DEN_call_on_militias_desc: "Denmark does not have a formal home guard or militia system, so one must be drafted, as the threat of German invasion is a national emergency.

Since Thorvald Stauning's declaration that Denmark is better be off as a republic than as a monarchy, the head of state has been the Prime Minister-President.

The loss of Denmark's primary trade partner and a series of ineffective governments have made economic recovery slow and difficult.\nFor most of the past decade, Thorvald Stauning's Socialdemokratiet have been in power, yet the changes he and his cabinet wish to implement have been consistently challenged by a deeply entrenched opposition.\nAs Denmark enters a new era, the question remains: will it be Stauning, or will it be chaos?"

 DEN_country_intro_background: "GFX_DEN_intro"
 DEN_country_intro_header: "Denmark during the Weltkrieg"
 DEN_country_intro_content: "During the Great War, Denmark, along with its Scandinavian neighbours, maintained a §Yposition of neutrality§!. Its neutrality, however, was not uncontested. Denmark was forced to comply with §LGerman demands§! to mine its territorial waters—an action tacitly accepted by Britain. Despite avoiding direct involvement in the conflict, Denmark's territorial sovereignty was compromised.\n\nThe war also had severe domestic repercussions. Like the Central Powers, Denmark was heavily affected by the §tblockades of the Entente§!. Essential goods became scarce, and the economy began to buckle under the strain. Within Prime Minister §YCarl Theodor Zahle§!'s coalition government of the §lRadikale Venstre§! and §SSocialdemokratiet§!, Foreign Minister §YErik Scavenius§! worked to maintain Denmark's neutrality, and Minister of the Interior §YOve Rode§! spearheaded economic regulation, imposing measures similar to those in Germany. Critics accused the Zahle government of being overly sympathetic to Germany, especially as these regulations cut into many Danish companies' profits, while others profiteered from exports to Germany.\n\nAmid the turmoil of war, Denmark still adopted a §Ynew constitution§! that made elections more proportional and granted women the right to vote. By the end of the war, however, the tide of popular opinion had turned against Zahle and his cabinet. His wartime economic policies were deeply unpopular, and the scarcity of goods fuelled widespread unrest. The situation worsened when the Central Powers emerged victorious from the war: Denmark now found itself hemmed in by a dominant §LGerman Empire§!, while the §tEntente Cordiale§!, once a balancing force, was in disarray."

 DEN_country_intro_header_1: "An Economy in Tatters §P(1921 - 1924)§!"
 DEN_country_intro_content_1: "In the 1921 elections, the liberal §mVenstre§! party returned to power under the leadership of §YNiels Neergaard§!, forming a coalition with the §cKonservative Folkeparti§!. Neergaard's government promised to dismantle the 'oppressive' systems put in place by the Zahle government and assured the Danish people that his government would restore 'peacetime stability'.\n\nWith Denmark's main trading partner, the §tUnited Kingdom§!, slow to re-establish economic links, the §Yeconomic situation§!, however, remained turbulent, and Neergaard's approach to governance created additional friction within the government. This tension reached a breaking point in mid-August 1922, when one of Venstre's key figures, §YJ.C. Christensen§!, resigned. His departure severely weakened party unity, with much of Venstre rallying around Christensen's protégé, the Minister of Agriculture, §YThomas Madsen-Mygdal§!.\n\nNow battered, Venstre found itself engulfed in a series of government crises. The most significant crisis came with the §Ycrash of Landmandsbanken§!, Denmark's largest bank and the financial cornerstone of the agricultural sector, which made up the bulk of Venstre's support base. Although the §cKonservative Folkeparti§! managed to save the bank through emergency measures, the damage to Neergaard's government was done. His administration muddled through the following years, its mishandling of the financial crisis fuelling widespread dissatisfaction. This economic mismanagement became a powerful campaigning tool for §YThorvald Stauning§!'s §SSocialdemokratiet§!, which capitalised on the public's frustration in the run-up to the next election."

 DEN_country_intro_header_2: "Re-alignment towards Mitteleuropa §P(1924 - 1926)§!"
 DEN_country_intro_content_2: "The formation of §LMitteleuropa§! presented Denmark with an opportunity. As Germany's economy flourished, Denmark saw a chance to benefit by aligning itself with the Mitteleuropa system and tapping into the expanding German market, and so the year of 1924 marked a pivot for Denmark under §YThorvald Stauning§!'s newly-elected §SSocialdemokratiet§!: by  strengthening Denmark's §Yeconomic ties§! with §LGermany§! and officially §Yjoining§! the §LMitteleuropa§! bloc, he promised to embrace the economic realignment already underway, fully acknowledging Denmark's growing dependence on Germany as its main trading partner.\n\nAfter the election, Stauning and his cabinet in coalition with §lRadikale Venstre§!, set out plans to secure Denmark's economic future and heal its social divisions through a series of reforms spearheaded by Justice Minister §YKarl Kristian Steincke§!. These plans would evolve over the next decade, laying out the foundation for a more prosperous and equitable nation.\n\nStauning's first term, however, was soon to be marred by challenges. His efforts were continuously stymied by the §mVenstre§!-§cKF§! majority in the upper house, or Landstinget, and this political gridlock grew worse with the eruption of the §tBritish Revolution§! across the North Sea, an event that stirred anti-leftist sentiment throughout Danish society. Even §YKing Christian X§! publicly voiced his concern about the '§tatrocities§!' committed by the British revolutionaries in his 1926 New Year's Address, the first of its kind to be broadcast on the radio, which only deepened the political divide and triggered what became known as '§tNytårskrisen§!' or the New Year's Crisis. Despite rumours that the King might dismiss the government, this never came to pass."

 DEN_country_intro_header_3: "A Decade of Compromises §P(1926 - 1936)§!"
 DEN_country_intro_content_3: "Stauning's §SSocialdemokratiet§!, now increasingly isolated, struggled to maintain its momentum. Unable to pass a budget for 1927, the government was forced to call a snap election in December of 1926, which saw a §mVenstre§!-§cKF§! coalition return to power, this time under the leadership of the fiscally conservative §YThomas Madsen-Mygdal§!. Yet this coalition, too, was plagued by internal discord, particularly over the §Ymilitary budget§!. While the §cKF§! pushed for increased defence spending due to rising revolutionary tensions across Europe and even in neighbouring Scandinavia, §mVenstre§! was more hesitant. The lack of consensus resulted in a largely ineffective government.\n\nIn the 1929 election, Stauning's §SSocialdemokratiet§! once again returned to power. Since then, Stauning has governed continuously, albeit with only marginal reform efforts held back by the need to compromise. The enduring §mVenstre§!-§cKF§! Landstinget majority has blocked many of Stauning's proposals, particularly those aimed at establishing a comprehensive welfare state. While Stauning remains committed to his vision, the road to realising his dream has been fraught with obstacles.\n\nMany now wonder what the future holds for Denmark. Will the country remain bound to the §cconservative§! §Yupper house§! and its willingness to fight §tSyndicalism§! abroad?

### Events ###
 denmark_events.2.t: "'Black Monday' Hits Denmark"
 denmark_events.2.d: "The stock crisis on the Berlin Stock Exchange has rapidly rippled throughout Europe and has naturally hit Denmark as well. Investors are panicking at Børsen, and the crisis is hurting other sectors as well. Unfortunately, a large part of the Danish economy is based on agriculture, which means the sudden crash will have lasting effects on Landmandsbanken (The Farmer's Bank), Denmark's largest bank.\n\nAs the crisis continues to spiral out of control, Thorvald Stauning has met with his cabinet on ways to try and mitigate the initial shockwave, and ongoing negotiations with Radikale Venstre leader Peter Munch will continue for weeks. Unfortunately, this has allowed the opposition to lobby complaints at the government for its entry into the German economic sphere, and this tie has allowed the Danish economy to fall further, faster."
 denmark_events.2.a: "We need a plan, and fast!"

 denmark_events.3.t: "Workers Strike"
 denmark_events.3.d: "In response to the hardships the Danish economy has been hit by, lots of people were laid off. Worrying for their own jobs, workers in one of Denmark's major companies have started a strike, seeking an arrangement with the bosses to ensure job security. Many have suspected that Føderationen may be supporting and inciting turbulent action amongst the workers, but there has been little conclusive evidence so far."
 denmark_events.3.a: "Let them strike!"
 denmark_events.3.b: "Compromise!"
 denmark_events.3.c: "Drive them back to the workplaces!"

 denmark_events.4.t: "Unrest from Føderationen"
 denmark_events.4.d: "Large marches have been held today by the so-called 'Kommunistisk Føderation', a big tent party coalescing many far-left organisations. This collection of socialist factions and cliques stands for the overthrow of the king, with many of its leaders affiliated with the infamous 'storm at Børsen' assault on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange, who are directly being supported by Paris. Following the fallout of the 'Black Monday' stock market crash, they happily point out how in the Commune, there is no crisis, arguing for a syndicalist system in Denmark.\n\nAlthough there have been a few instances of violence where the police could intervene, especially where the Totalist wing of this organisation, the Kommunarders, led by Martin Andersen Nexø and Børge Houmann, was involved, most marches remained peaceful, possibly in the hope of provoking police action where it wasn't needed. Within the boundaries of the constitution, there is little we can do."
 denmark_events.4.a: "Syndicalism? In Denmark?"

 denmark_events.5.t: "The Clash between DS and the ND"
 denmark_events.5.d: "Ever since the establishment of Det Nye Danmark (The New Denmark) by Max Arildskov after his personal friend Boris Savinkov's SZRS, the far-right of the Danish political spectrum has been hopelessly divided. Prior to the establishment of the ND, the Dansk Samling (Danish Unity) ruled here, but as much as their policies may seem similar, they could hardly be more divided; where the DS also holds an anti-parliamentary stance, the ND accepts no compromise over the idea of a foreign monarch ruling over Denmark. Dansk Samling was founded by Arne Sørensen after disdain from the increasingly pro-German stance held by the Danish government as well as growing parliamentarisation, and especially abhorrent of the joining with the German economic sphere.\n\nIt is clear that Arne Sørensen, the leader of DS, could've torn open this fringe part of the Danish political scene, but considering the size of the pond they're fishing from, these events are more likely to harm the Danish far-right than to do it any good."
 denmark_events.5.a: "The DS remains in the lead here."
 denmark_events.5.b: "The ND is rising..."

 denmark_events.6.t: "Arildskov Visits the Vozhd"
 denmark_events.6.d: "Max Arildskov, former volunteer fighter in the Russian Civil War and so-called 'Fører' of the Savinkovite Det Nye Danmark (The New Denmark) party, has visited his colleague Boris Savinkov in Moscow. In his meeting, he congratulated the 'Vozhd' on his newfound greater power in the Russian Republic and used the opportunity to harden his stance on the German and syndicalist influence in Denmark.\n\nWhile it may not amount to much, some people do seem susceptible to his words and his Russian ally's success, and we do see a small growth in his movement, even if it is still barely enough to win a seat or two in the Folketing in the coming elections. The Dansk Samling is probably worried, however, being the main pool of support for the party of the 'Fører'."
 denmark_events.6.a: "'Fører'? It sounds so dumb..."

 denmark_events.7.t: "Troubling Reports at the Farms"
 denmark_events.7.d: "Danish agriculture is the backbone of the Danish economy, and while this may have limited the effects of the stock collapse, troubling reports are surfacing. Contrary to our expectations, the free economies of Europe have not recovered from the shock of the 'Black Monday' stock market crash, and consequently, food prices are much lower than usual. As a result, a lot of food remains either unsold or is sold at a loss, meaning that many farmers risk an inability to pay for their mortgages and therefore are liable to foreclosure of their farms.\n\nThorvald Stauning has begun negotiations with Venstre on a solution to the failing Danish economy, but due to conflicts in cabinet policies, little progress has been made. While the government squabbles and a solution is unable to be reached, Danish workers, farmers, and businessmen alike suffer under the toil of increasing unemployment."
 denmark_events.7.a: "This might be bad..."

 denmark_events.8.t: "Wake-Up Call for Recovery"
 denmark_events.8.d: "The evolution of the economic crisis from its initial shockwaves has blown a hole through the entirety of Denmark; urban citizens are losing jobs at an alarming rate, and farmers have begun to auction off their unprofitable farms, which has led to a decimation of Danish agriculture. Stauning's negotiations with his cabinet and then with Venstre have met at an impasse, and with elections scheduled for later this year, a plan has to be made. Concessions will have to be set aside to appease Stauning's coalition partner, Radikale Venstre, but also to convince Venstre leader Thomas Madsen-Mygdal of a plan for recovery.\n\nOn the table for recovery, Stauning has outlined a clear plan for success which will tackle talks with KF, handling the banking crisis, tackling the inflation of workers' wages, dictating the fate of the krone, and dealing with the shockwave of decline in Danish businesses. Stauning's success in these talks may prove vital for Socialdemokratiet's success in the upcoming election in September."
 denmark_events.8.a: "Now that we have a plan of action, let's get to work."

 denmark_events.9.t: "Farm Foreclosures"
 denmark_events.9.d: "As expected, many farmers can no longer keep up with their loans, forcing the bank to sell their farms in impromptu auctions that are usually bought up by large landowners who have the reserves to buy these plots of land, making the whole deal even more painful for the farmers. Many voices are rising in the government to relieve the farmers, but can we afford to do it? Should we relieve the farmers, it would be a boon to the opposition and could aid in economic recovery, but it would hurt the stability of the coalition; we could instead forego relief and focus our efforts on the urban workers in trouble."
 denmark_events.9.a: "Relieve them as soon as possible!"
 denmark_events.9.b: "Refocus our efforts to urban hardships."

 denmark_events.11.t: "General Farmer's Strike"
 denmark_events.11.d: "Across the country, farmers have entered into a farmers' strike. Fomented nominally by the Danish Venstresocialistiske Parti, as part of Føderationen, these strikes are another formal reminder that Føderationen will use any opportunity to aid the workers and farmers in these crises. Recognising that the low prices are forcing them to sell their farms, they hold off on selling their produce to force the prices to rise again. While this initiative is commendable, it hurts non-farmers immensely, who have often been hit by the crisis by now as well, and who can't afford to buy their bread anymore."
 denmark_events.11.a: "Give concessions to stop the strike!"
 denmark_events.11.b: "We'll just have to tire them out!"
 denmark_events.11.c: "Break this 'farmers' strike'!"

 denmark_events.12.t: "Farmer's Strike Stands Fast"
 denmark_events.12.d: "Despite our unwillingness to give them further relief, the farmers are resilient. They don't budge and still hope to force the food prices up so they can maintain their farms."
 denmark_events.12.a: "It is time for us to give in!"
 denmark_events.12.b: "It's almost done, I assure you!"

 denmark_events.13.t: "Farmer's Strike Subsides"
 denmark_events.13.d: "As a result of the farmers' strike, the food prices have risen somewhat, but not nearly as much as the farmers would have liked. They probably also hoped that the government would give them relief, but neither did this come. As more and more farms are expropriated by the banks, more and more farmers give in and sell their goods at the new market price that has stabilised. And since this has caused it to shrink again, this process is only being accelerated."
 denmark_events.13.a: "That's good, I guess..."

 ### New Pre-Kanslergade Agreement Recovery Events

 denmark_events.14.t: "Negotiations with KF"
 denmark_events.14.d: "The Konservative Folkeparti, or the Conservative People's Party, are the dominant conservative right-wing force in Denmark. However, troubles in their party led to a schism, where the constitutionalists under John Christmas Møller have entered into a coalition with Venstre, whilst the autocratic wing remains nothing more than a hub for radicalism. In order to have a chance to convince Venstre, aligning with Møller and the KF on issues will serve us well. A lot of the voter base of KF originates within the Funktionærer, or the middle class made up of mainly clerks, and as goodwill, we could offer concessions and invest in relief post-haste.\n\nStauning has organised his cabinet for this, and many are advocating an exchange, where a higher income tax could be levied, but such demands could scare off the KF from agreeing. Investing in KF could not only aid in popularly bringing over their allies in Venstre to our side, but we could also have them agree to drop their coalition in the upcoming election race, solidifying our victory."
 denmark_events.14.a: "Fine, we'll make concessions to them as well."
 denmark_events.14.b: "There are more important citizens in need of our aid and investment; decline."

 denmark_events.15.t: "Position of the Krone"
 denmark_events.15.d: "The Danish krone, introduced in 1875, serves as the currency of Denmark. Apart from the decade between 1914 and 1924, it has always been on the gold standard, which has ensured confidence in its viability as a means of payment. Today, however, the current economic crisis has placed its value into a tenuous spot, and politicians across the spectrum have differing views on where it should stand.\n\nVoices from the opposition, conservative-minded politicians are quick to propose good old-fashioned austerity politics to boost the value of the krone, which, they argue, would not only help restore confidence in our currency and curb inflation, but would also ensure that goods remain affordable for the common citizen in Denmark.\n\nVoices within the ruling coalition, however, have argued for abandoning the gold standard again, if only temporarily, as we did during the hardships of the Weltkrieg years, in order to be more flexible in how we handle inflation - an approach which is more in line with modern economic theory and which would give us an edge in Mitteleuropean trade if we regulate our inflation in such a way that our Danish goods become cheap enough to gain an edge on the German market but expensive enough to make a good profit for Denmark."
 denmark_events.15.a: "Let us try this new scheme."
 denmark_events.15.b: "The gold standard is kept."

 denmark_events.16.t: "A Demand for Decisive Action"
 denmark_events.16.d: "The right to strike in Denmark is guaranteed by the 'Standard Rules for Handling Industrial Disputes', drawn up in 1907 and rarely amended. It sets out the rules for declaring collective action by both sides, with the basic requirement that there must have been an attempt to settle the dispute through negotiation, first at the local level between workers and employers, and then at the national level between trade unions and employers' organisations, such as the Dansk Arbejdsgiverforening.\n\nThe rate at which things are happening means that both trade unions and employers' organisations are struggling to keep up with the action on the ground. A third of Danish workers have lost their jobs, and many strikes are being attended by seemingly unconnected people, some of whom are former employees, and some of whom are allegedly 'foreign agitators'. Some employers have resorted to locking workers out of their factories altogether, and some who didn't manage to do so in time claim that their factories are now being occupied by militant strikers. At the same time, we are seeing an unprecedented number of sympathy strikes across entire industries, which are legal under the 1899 September Compromise, but in the current situation, almost anything could reasonably be argued to be a 'sympathy' strike.\n\nFrankly, the situation in and around Denmark's factories is a mess, and it's probably impossible to make a fair and balanced judgement at the moment. If we do what the major employers' organisations are urging us to do, we run the risk of violating a lot of people's right to collective action, and if the situation is as bad as reported, the ensuing struggle could cause more material damage than has already been done."
 denmark_events.16.a: "Storm the factories and crush the strikers, lest they bring our industry to its knees."
 denmark_events.16.b: "It is their right to strike, but make them come to the negotiating table."

 denmark_events.17.t: "Act on Measures for the Protection of the Danish Currency"
 denmark_events.17.d: "At the instigation of none other than Thomas Madsen-Mygdal, though not without controversy within his own party, a new law is to re-establish the Valutacentral, or the 'Exchange Control Office', and task it once more with monitoring domestic monetary affairs and the import and use of foreign currency in Denmark.\n\nThis time, however, additional functions are being considered, namely the correction of the balance of trade and the regulation of the economy through import controls. A radical initiative, it has alienated the more classically liberal-minded within Venstre and most of the KF, but is welcomed by Socialdemokratiet.\n\nWhat has prompted Madsen-Mygdal to take this radical step is nothing other than Germany's own import control measures; a temporary doubling of import duties on butter, applying to imports exceeding 5,000 tonnes, is expected to leave some 25,000 tonnes of Danish butter without a German buyer. Cynical observers might note that the forthcoming elections would also be of concern to Madsen-Mygdal, whose main constituency is made up of farmers.\n\nOpponents to the proposed import controls were quick to rally behind a counter-proposal: the imposition of wide-ranging protective tariffs through the Valutacentral, they argue, could rectify our reliance on German products in the long run and lead to a projected increase in revenue in the short term; however, doing so would arguably violate Mitteleuropa treaties, and thus could put strain on our relations with the German economic sphere. Stauning and the cabinet are in agreement: abandoning Mitteleuropa would only throw Denmark into further disarray, and say that the German economy, while not exactly 'friendly' and in tatters just like ours, is our best hope for survival."
 denmark_events.17.a: "Our responsibility is to implement policies that will work for the common Dane."
 denmark_events.17.b: "Let's see how far we can rock this boat."

 ###Events

 denmark_events.18.t: "Kanslergade Agreement"
 denmark_events.18.d: "This morning, representatives from the Venstre Party arrived at Thorvald Stauning's apartment at Kanslergade 10, meeting with Stauning and representatives of the ruling coalition. It has become clear that the resolution of this crisis will require a greater effort than just buying up stocks to stabilise the Børsen exchange. Now that Denmark's agriculture has been hit, the government does not have the mandate in the Landsting, meaning no measures would ever come through without an agreement with the liberals. The whole day was spent viciously arguing over the details, but in the evening..."
 denmark_events.18.a: "... the Venstre representatives signed."
 denmark_events.18.b: "... it was concluded no agreement could be reached."

 denmark_events.19.t: "The [GetMonth] Folketing Elections of [GetYear]"
 denmark_events.19.d: "The Kanslergade Agreement, though thoroughly planned out, failed to win the support of the liberals and conservatives. The ensuing parliamentary deadlock forced Stauning, whose cabinet had been rendered inoperable, to call an early election. Barely a year after the 1935 elections, which Stauning's coalition had easily won, he was now fighting for his political survival. The last few weeks have been full of accusations about who is to blame for this turn of events, but ultimately it is now the Danish people's turn to decide which path the country will take on its road to recovery. The vote has now concluded and the result is clear:"
 denmark_events.19.a: "Madsen-Mygdal leads Venstre to victory."

 denmark_events.20.t: "Establishment of Rigspolitiet"
 denmark_events.20.d: "Today, Rigspolitiet (the National Police) started operations. This new organisation will serve henceforth as the uppermost level of Danish police, being under the command of a single national chief of police. This reform will be sure to streamline the Danish police apparatus for years to come, aiding the efficiency of our law enforcement and securing the law with an additional layer."
 denmark_events.20.a: "... in addition, it creates jobs."

 denmark_events.21.t: "Birth of Princess Margrethe"
 denmark_events.21.d: "Joyous news from the royal family today. Crown Prince Frederick and his wife Ingrid of Sweden announced that their first child has been born: Margrethe. The Danish constitution does not allow for women to inherit the throne; however, experts consider it unlikely she will someday be queen of Denmark. For now, however, it is time to feast, for the royal family has received its newest member."
 denmark_events.21.a: "Hurrah!"

 denmark_events.22.t: "Opening of the Storstrøm Bridge"
 denmark_events.22.d: "After 4 years of construction, the Storstrøm Bridge has been opened by [DEN.GetLeader]. The bridge connects the island of Falster with the island of Masnedø, which itself had been connected to Sjælland in 1935 with the Masnedsund Bridge. Now the island of Falster can be reached by train from Copenhagen. Additionally, with the Guldborgsund Bridge, Lolland can be reached by train without the need for a ferry now as well."
 denmark_events.22.a: "Next station: Langeland... Though that might be a bit trickier."

 denmark_events.23.t: "Hans Niels Andersen Died"
 denmark_events.23.d: "Entrepreneur and adventurer H.N. Andersen reportedly died today. Andersen was the founder of the so-called 'East Asiatic Company', the largest company in Denmark today. Not only in Denmark, the 'East Asiatic Company' reached worldwide fame as being one of the largest companies to serve routes between Europe and Asia.\n\nIn addition to his business ventures, he also served diplomatically, having unsuccessfully tried to initiate peace negotiations during the Weltkrieg and as Danish Consul General in Siam. As a Knight of the Elephant, a title awarded for his good work, he will surely be missed!"
 denmark_events.23.a: "Most definitely!"

 denmark_events.24.t: "Norwegian Documents Transferred"
 denmark_events.24.d: "A large number of documents concerning Norway, mostly originating from the time of Denmark-Norway, are about to be shipped to Oslo from our national archives, the Royal Danish Library, and the University Library. Norway will be sure to be pleased that their history will be brought to its proper location."
 denmark_events.24.a: "This is only natural."
 denmark_events.24.b: "Wait a sec, I see an error in the paperwork."

 denmark_events.25.t: "Norwegian Documents Transferred"
 denmark_events.25.d: "A shipment from the Danish national archives, the Danish Royal Library, and the Copenhagen University Library has just arrived. These are documents concerning Norway from the time Norway was part of Denmark. By moving these to our national archives, our history will be just a little bit more complete!"
 denmark_events.25.a: "Thank you, Denmark!"

 denmark_events.27.t: "The Death of Thomas Thrige"
 denmark_events.27.d: "Danish entrepreneur T.B. Thrige has reportedly left this world. Thrige was the founder of the Thrige-Bramsen company, which produced electric motors for agricultural and other purposes. A staunch believer in improving the lives of workers, he founded initiatives such as a housing association and a workers' education centre.\n\nThrige worked in the United States until he returned to Denmark after the war, on which many speculated that he foresaw the harsh years that America would come to face. An avid philanthropist, Thrige donated much of the money he earned to educational institutions, hospitals, and cultural organisations, a man generous and with a bigger heart than most."
 denmark_events.27.a: "Hvil I Fred!"

 denmark_events.28.t: "The Death of Harald Scavenius"
 denmark_events.28.d: "We have been notified that former foreign minister and first cousin of the current cabinet member Erik, Harald Scavenius, has died in The Hague, where he was assigned for foreign service since 1928. Scavenius, who considered himself a conservative and has been known for his strongly antisyndicalist attitude, has died as he lived: a diplomat working abroad."
 denmark_events.28.a: "Indeed..."

 denmark_events.29.t: "The Death of Peder Pedersen"
 denmark_events.29.d: "Engineer Peder Oluf Pedersen has died today in Copenhagen. Director and rector of the Polytechnical College, Pedersen was a visionary engineer who developed within the Danish electrical industry and played a key role in the invention of the Poulsen arc, a sound recorder. Many regarded him as a skilled leader who organised researchers and students around a common goal, having also chaired the Electronic Committee and the Association of Engineers."
 denmark_events.29.a: "He will be missed."

 denmark_events.30.t: "The Death of Thorvald Stauning"
 denmark_events.30.d: "Thorvald Stauning, one of the most influential statesmen of Denmark ever, has died today. Stauning, longtime chairman of the Social Democrats, brought his party to power and then to a share of the popular vote that before him no one could have conceived. Stauning [DEN_get_stauning_death_loc]"
 denmark_events.30.a: "Nothing less than a state funeral will do!"

 denmark_events.32.t: "Trouble in the KF"
 denmark_events.32.d: "The Danish Conservative People's Party, formerly known simply as the Right, are the third-largest party in the Folketing. Recently, however, they have been the victim of in-fighting: witnessing our system of government, the party is hopelessly divided by its democratic wing, led by John Christmas Møller, who also leads the party's parliamentary faction at the moment, who stand for the healthy democracy we enjoy in Denmark today, and Victor Pürschel, who, aided by Jack Westergaard and his Conservative Youth, desires a return to the more traditional Højre stance with a lot of support from the radicalised youth of today, aiming to retain the reserve powers which exist as a thorn in our side to this day.\n\nThe radicalism of the right has not only cemented distrust in the KF, but criticism has been lambasted towards John Christmas Møller over his desires for continued cross party support, opposing the king in the matters of 1926. He argues that Danish conservatism must be one with national unity, and for many to flock to the cause of dismantling this carefully crafted democracy that has been cemented over the course of several decades would lead Denmark to ruin. Though much of KF disagrees with Møller's stance, there is something to be said about the tenuous nature of Danish democracy in this day and age."
 denmark_events.32.a: "Though fragile, Denmark's democracy shall not shatter in the face of radicalism."

 denmark_events.34.t: "Denmark Petitions to Join the Reichspakt"
 denmark_events.34.d: "Wisely seeking to fight along our forces, the Danish government has petitioned us to join us in our struggle against our enemies. There is seemingly little reason to not have them join, especially since their ascension in the pact would lock down the Baltic Sea in our favour, safeguarding our flank there."
 denmark_events.34.a: "Willkommen!"
 denmark_events.34.b: "No, thanks!"

 denmark_events.35.t: "Germany Agrees"
 denmark_events.35.d: "Germany has agreed to let us into their faction. Together we shall crush our enemies and scare away our foes!"
 denmark_events.35.a: "Når tysken kommer her."

 denmark_events.36.t: "Germany Rejects Us"
 denmark_events.36.d: "Germany has rejected our application to join the Reichspakt, referencing their need to protect us and that they can't spare the troops to do that."
 denmark_events.36.a: "The implication is what hurts the most."

 denmark_events.37.t: "The King Fires [GetSecondInCommand]"
 denmark_events.37.d: "Unexpected news arrived from the palace: King Christian X has dismissed [GetSecondInCommand] and his ministers and replaced him with Victor Pürschel, the leader of the authoritarian (royalist) wing of the KF, citing concerns over the cabinet's incompetence, unchecked rampant corruption, and the risk this brings to the continued prosperity of Denmark. It is highly questionable, however, if the king's resolve will stay this strong if significant resistance grows to these actions. Already, the Kommunistisk Føderation has called on the workers to launch a general strike against the newly conservative installed government, even declaring that the king be deposed for such an act of authoritarianism. The army so far has split itself in terms of its allegiance, and it will take time for KF's radicals and Victor Pürschel to quell dissent and cement their rule over Denmark.\n\nWith the radicals of KF able to follow through on their every wish and desire, Denmark will now formally align itself with the German hegemon."
 denmark_events.37.a: "Should we have allowed these reserve powers to persist?"

 denmark_events.38.t: "Stauning Shows His True Colours"
 denmark_events.38.d: "After his disastrous fall from grace, as one of the leading popular Prime Ministers of Denmark, Thorvald Stauning has announced some shocking news regarding the continuation of his leadership of Socialdemokratiet. Seeing as Denmark has taken a drastic turn in politics after his failure to secure the government during the Constitutional Crisis, Stauning has decided to throw his hat in with the Kommunistisk Føderation. Stauning may not be a committed socialist, which raises questions about his decision, in which he addressed much of Denmark that to preserve the last hope for democracy, one must make sacrifices.\n\nWith the king's seemingly total control over politics taking a turn for the worst, it is not surprising that the largest thorn in his side has had sympathies for the left who are more willing to cooperate with his once proposals for truer Danish democracy. He has joined their side not out of desire for Denmark to become a socialist dictatorship, instead being encouraged by radical former members of Socialdemokratiet.\n\nDisgraced from the crisis and now party leadership, not everyone in Socialdemokratiet is convinced by Stauning's claims and has largely soured their attitude towards supporting a popular uprising. Vilhelm Buhl takes on new leadership of the party and shall guide Socialdemokratiet from here on out, though a small loss of membership and the fallback of Danish democracy since the crisis has soured their popularity. It is unlikely that they will return to prominence anytime soon, for that matter."
 denmark_events.38.a: "A wolf in sheep's clothing."

 denmark_events.39.t: "Dealing with the Welfare State Reforms"
 denmark_events.39.d: "Tirelessly, Pürschel has been working hard to cement his government's legitimacy after having been appointed in the face of Stauning's defeat. This involves tearing down every last relic of the old government, which has spent an overwhelming amount of the budget on state reforms. Many of these reforms coalesce into Stauning's concept of the 'Welfare State' and involve drastically diverting the efficiency of our industry in favour of the people.\n\nHowever, there is no room for excess government spending for reforms such as these, and many in the KF are demanding that we pass laws to backslide them. The King has stood firmly in favour of Pürschel's best judgement on such a matter. If we decide to accede to these demands, it will no doubt create unrest broadly across the population, but it will adhere to appeasing supporters of the KF overall. Instead, we could always choose to keep them intact and divert their legacy to our own."

 denmark_events.39.b: "Deal with only the most egregious reforms, and keep some intact."
 denmark_events.39.c: "Leave them alone."

 denmark_events.40.t: "The King Fires [GetSecondInCommand]"
 denmark_events.40.d: "Unexpected news arrived from the palace: King Christian X has dismissed [GetSecondInCommand] and his ministers and replaced him with John Christmas Møller, the leader of the conservative (constitutionalist) wing of the KF, citing concerns over the cabinet's incompetence, unchecked rampant corruption, and the risk this brings to the continued prosperity of Denmark. It is highly questionable, however, if the king's resolve will stay this strong if significant resistance grows to these actions. Already, Venstre has called on its party's supporters to back their new coalition leaders as their cabinet has been forcibly pushed out of power.\n\nJohn Christmas Møller has publicly declared his intentions to maintain Denmark's fragile democracy, but only time can tell if he will fulfil these promises. With the king having appointed an adequate government suited to his liking, Denmark can now formally align itself with the German hegemon."
 denmark_events.40.a: "Should we have allowed these reserve powers to persist?"

 denmark_events.41.t: "Westergaard on the Move"
 denmark_events.41.d: "Despite only having recently entered office, Møller received notice that fellow Konservative party member, Jack Westergaard, has challenged his position as Prime Minister. Jack Westergaard, the current leader of the Konservative Ungdom (Young Conservatives), has been nothing but outspoken about his views on KF's party line. Aligning with ideologues in the autocratic wing of the party, such as Victor Pürschel, Westergaard is undoubtedly unsatisfied with Møller and the constitutionalists.\n\nMost of the party is aligned with Møller, however, especially with the King's appointment legitimising his rule as Prime Minister. Westergaard is ambitious and garners attention from across the spectrum as a young upstart who seeks to drastically dismantle our precious democracy."
 denmark_events.41.a: "Young and unwieldy, yet he'll still spell trouble."

 denmark_events.42.t: "Westergaard Holds a Rally"
 denmark_events.42.d: "Westergaard gathered alongside a large crowd today in Copenhagen, meeting with thousands of his supporters. The Konservative Ungdom, made up of both young conservative supporters as well as student conservatives, hold signs and chant to the beat of Westergaard's drum. While this rally is not necessarily violent, many in the KF have displayed concerns about the effects of having such a large, organised protest remain active throughout the week.\n\nIn response, Møller has denounced Westergaard and has called on the police to maintain order. It remains unseen, however, as to whether or not this situation will erupt into violence, but the situation in Copenhagen remains tenuous."
 denmark_events.42.a: "Nothing more than a legionary copycat."

 denmark_events.43.t: "Westergaard Meets with King Christian"
 denmark_events.43.d: "The situation since Møller's appointment has reached a fever pitch, and in light of the ongoing tension, Westergaard has decided to request an audience with Christian X. Pandering towards the king's disdain towards the democratically elected governments over the past two decades, and his willingness to utilise his reserve powers, Westergaard has presented his plans to quell the opposition's protest and bring stability back to Denmark.\n\nAlongside Westergaard stands Carsten Raft, the prior leader of the Konservative Ungdom and staunch advocate for taking influence from popular right-wing movements across Europe, such as the Legionaries in Romania or Savinkov in Russia. If his plot succeeds, Westergaard's plan to end democracy in Denmark may truly come to fruition."
 denmark_events.43.a: "The traitors squabble amongst themselves."

 denmark_events.44.t: "Westergaard Delivers an Ultimatum!"
 denmark_events.44.d: "Chaos has erupted in Copenhagen! Møller and the constitutionalist wing of the KF met today after Westergaard, with the backing of the autocratic wing of the KF, presented an ultimatum demanding Møller resign from office. Taking to the streets with Carsten Raft, the Konservative Ungdom has stepped up from his rally last month and has begun organising columns by the thousands throughout the major streets in Copenhagen.\n\nWestergaard and his youth wing have decided to pick fights with those who aligned themselves with the opposition, while rallying many supporters to the KF to join them on their crusade. Møller has yet to respond to the demands and accusations of the opposition, having preferred to conjure a legitimate plan through conferences with the constitutionalist wing of the KF. King Christian X is watching the situation carefully and informs Møller that he must make a decision quickly in order to contain the situation.\n\nHaving debated with his ministers, Møller decides to..."
 denmark_events.44.a: "Call on loyal army units in Copenhagen to maintain order at all costs."
 denmark_events.44.b: "Resign, there is no other option."

 denmark_events.45.t: "The Konservative Ungdom Disperses"
 denmark_events.45.d: "Army units under General With received Møller's call to action and quickly dispatched units of the army to aid in quelling the protests. Westergaard and the Konservative Ungdom eventually stood down in the face of With's forces and withdrew from the city centre. Having secured his rule over the party and its leadership, Møller dismissed Westergaard as leader of the Konservative Ungdom and placed Aksel Møller in charge. Møller is now free to properly assess the country's situation and deal with the opposition."
 denmark_events.45.a: "With that minor interruption out of the way, time to deal with the situation at hand."

 denmark_events.46.t: "Westergaard Appointed Prime Minister"
 denmark_events.46.d: "In the face of Møller resigning, King Christian X had no choice but to accede to Westergaard's demands to be appointed Prime Minister. Many in the KF who backed Møller found his choice to be extremely distasteful, and have announced their own resignations in the face of Westergaard's appointment. Despite this, Westergaard has made a public announcement declaring that Denmark shall no longer be led astray, and under his paternal guidance, as well as loyalty to the monarchy, Denmark shall be guided into a new golden age.\n\nFollowing this address, Westergaard has appointed Carsten Raft as leader of the Konservative Ungdom in his stead, hoping to model the youth wing into a true paramilitary under Raft's guidance. Westergaard's radical transformation of Denmark has only begun..."

 denmark_events.47.t: "The Unicameralism Referendum of [getYear]"
 denmark_events.47.d: "After a heated session in parliament, and the votes of over 60% of Danes across the country, news has finally come in of the recent referendum passed by John Christmas Møller in an attempt to finally end majority rule over the country. Møller's referendum dictates that Denmark would be better off without the Rigsdag, their bicameral parliament which was made up of the Folketing (Lower House) and the Landsting (Upper House). This move comes as a popular response to finally clarify Danish bureaucracy and improve the government's abilities to pass laws and bills without having to pass through the Landsting, which at this point only seemed to serve as a rubber stamp.\n\nClearly inscribed within the changes this referendum will hold towards the constitution include Møller's long-desired Parliamentarism of Denmark, which ensures that no government will have a majority of members in opposition. Apart from this, with the abolishment of the Landsting, the Folketing will now comprise of 179 members. Finally, the office of the Ombudsman has been added to the Folketing, which will further aid in safeguarding Danish democracy forevermore."
 denmark_events.47.a: "A triumph for Møller and the KF!"

 denmark_events.48.t: "Riot in Copenhagen!"
 denmark_events.48.d: "Disturbing news has reached Westergaard's office late last evening after the Konservative Ungdom clashed with members of the Kommunistisk Føderation. The Kommunistisk Føderation, after having long organised against their very existence, has finally turned to violence after receiving arms from an unknown source. Many in the KF suspect that the French or British syndicalists may have provided these arms through a secret channel, however, Westergaard has decided to use this opportunity to hatch a plan to secure power once and for all.\n\nWestergaard has quickly dispatched members of the army, as well as some recently armed brigades in the Konservative Ungdom to help secure order. With the balance of Copenhagen hanging on by a thread, all eyes are on Westergaard."
 denmark_events.48.a: "Westergaard must solve this crisis, one way or another!"

 denmark_events.49.t: "Passing of the Bemyndigelseslov"
 denmark_events.49.d: "The tumultuous situation in Copenhagen has reached its timely conclusion as Westergaard has pushed through a law that will help to settle things once and for all. King Christian X met with Westergaard late last night, demanding an answer towards the sudden uprising in Copenhagen, and Westergaard presented evidence that Stauning and Socialdemokratiet have been cooperating with the syndicalists in France to overthrow their fragile regime. While many of the documents presented were clearly forged, the king's bias towards them, as well as the mounting pressure to settle this crisis, has overturned any means of logic or clear thinking present.\n\nWith overwhelming support from the KF, the Rigsdag was eventually pressured into signing away their power towards Westergaard, who they see as the only means left capable of settling this crisis. Therefore, Westergaard has decided to invoke the 'Bemyndigelseslov' (Enabling Act), providing extraneous power centralised within the role of the Prime Minister and his party, while still maintaining the reserve powers of the king. Utilising this law, Westergaard has pushed to crush this uprising and ban the Kommunistisk Føderation once and for all, while also cancelling elections for the time being.\n\nThe opposition, led primarily by Peter Munch after Stauning's ungraceful fall from prominence, has protested this act, calling it truly undemocratic and an authoritarian power grab, but due to the faltering of Socialdemokratiet, it seems he is falling on deaf ears. In a speech given days after this act came to pass, Westergaard has announced that the 'National Rebirth' of Denmark is at last, and announced his plans to replace the faltering parliamentary democracy with what he dubs 'Social Nationalism'."
 denmark_events.49.a: "Westergaard is truly the man Denmark needs!"

 denmark_events.50.t: "The Future of Danish Liberalism"
 denmark_events.50.d: "With the war in Europe coming to a close, [GetSecondInCommand] has announced a meeting among delegates within Venstre and Radikale Venstre to discuss the future of the two parties. The wartime coalition, having rehabilitated much of Radikale Venstre, has created a new front for liberalism in Denmark, one that hasn't been seen since the party shattered several decades ago leading to the original division in the first place. However, [GetSecondInCommand] and Peter Munch of the Radikale Venstre have been discussing the possible return of Forenede Venstre as a single party, which would no doubt alienate the unique identities of the two parties but cement a united liberal party once more.\n\nOne key issue in the possibility of returning to the glory days of 1872 and a majority in parliament once more is the continued military alliance with Germany. Peter Munch has agreed to all but continuing to fight in wars dragged on by the German hegemon, going as far as to say that Germany could encroach on Danish independence should we nestle too closely with the Kaiser and his lackeys. [GetSecondInCommand] now has a choice: maintain the separate parties within this coalition as well as our alliance with Germany, or perhaps reinvigorate Danish neutrality with a polite request to exit the military alliance."
 denmark_events.50.a: "The status quo is satisfactory, don't bother."
 denmark_events.50.b: "Present our request to the German foreign minister at once!"

 denmark_events.150.t: "Denmark Requests to Leave the Reichspakt"
 denmark_events.150.d: "Following the defeat of the Internationale and Russia to our east, our small ally to the north has delivered a request to our foreign minister, requesting that they be allowed a safe exit from our military alliance, as well as guaranteeing their neutrality. Some in our government have expressed their concerns about allowing Denmark to restore neutrality, citing the need for access through their straits as well as cooperation in future wars as a necessity.\n\nThe Danish foreign minister has alleviated some of our concerns, having agreed to maintain membership in the Central European Customs Union, as well as strong trading ties. Shall we enforce their ties within our alliance or simply allow them to depart?"
 denmark_events.150.a: "Enforce our will upon Denmark, they shall remain."
 denmark_events.150.b: "Show some benevolence, allow their departure."

 denmark_events.250.t: "Germany Refuses our Request!"
 denmark_events.250.d: "Unfortunately, Germany has refused our request to exit the military alliance, citing concerns about the need for a continued military presence within our country, as well as access to our straits. While this news does not come as a large surprise, considering the aims of the German hegemon, Peter Munch has discarded plans to pursue the restoration of Forenede Venstre. Danish liberalism will continue to endure despite this slight hitch in our plans, at the behest of Germany, who seems to have greater plans than to appeal to our request."
 denmark_events.250.a: "Unfortunate circumstances..."

 denmark_events.350.t: "Germany Agrees to our Request"
 denmark_events.350.d: "Joyous news has arrived from the German foreign minister as our request for a safe departure from their military alliance has been approved, at the behest of those who grew to see Denmark as just another dominion in the German sphere of influence. With this proposal having succeeded, Peter Munch and [GetSecondInCommand] met in Copenhagen to announce the restoration of Forenede Venstre (United Left), which tore itself apart several decades ago. This sudden news has propelled the likes of former Prime Minister Carl Theodor Zahle to make a speech to those formerly in Radikale Venstre, reconciling much of the antimilitarists, given that Denmark has returned to a position akin to nearly 50 years ago.\n\nWith parliamentarism entrenched, social liberal reforms being applied in moderation, and Peter Munch and [GetSecondInCommand] working together, the future of Denmark looks exceptionally bright."
 denmark_events.350.a: "United once more into an unbreakable and unshatterable party!"

 denmark_events.51.t: "The Arrival of King Christian"
 denmark_events.51.d: "Christian von Glücksburg, former king of Denmark, has arrived in Berlin following a worrying development in his home country: in his attempt to bring the country in line with Germany, seeking to influence it into joining the Weltkrieg, he caused a scandal that ended in him losing the Danish throne, with the former Danish government now in a state of crisis.\n\nThe German foreign minister rejected any immediate declarations of war against Denmark, knowing full well that an escalation could push the Danish into the Internationale. Despite Christian von Glücksburg being staunchly aligned with our cause, there is some measure of goodwill in opening negotiations with the Danish government. The pen is mightier than the sword, and skilful diplomacy could aid in restoring relations with Denmark while also demanding some concessions, which would prove useful if an all-out military alliance is out of the picture."
 denmark_events.51.a: "Open negotiations with the new Danish government."
 denmark_events.51.b: "Demand the reinstatement of Christian von Glücksburg at once!"

 denmark_events.52.t: "Outrageous German Demands!"
 denmark_events.52.d: "The Germans have sent a demand on behalf of King Christian X, who had abdicated in the wake of the past crisis. [GetSecondInCommand] had already begun provisions for the next steps, but the German government has forced his hand, and now war looms on our doorstep. We stand no chance of combating Germany on our own, with an army a hundred times as large, we would barely last a day. One option remains open, though much of the government, including Radikale Venstre and moderate members of Socialdemokratiet, would be unhappy with it: contacting the Internationale for aid. This is a last-ditch effort, and [GetSecondInCommand] knows that France would demand critical socialist reform of our government, including adapting a socialist system in exchange for aid against Germany.\n\n[GetSecondInCommand] sat down with his cabinet and debated, deciding that the only answer was..."
 denmark_events.52.a: "The Internationale is our last hope... send an envoy at once!"

 denmark_events.53.t: "Denmark Wants Our Help!"
 denmark_events.53.d: "The Danish government has sent an urgent envoy, declaring that the government in Berlin has demanded the reinstatement of their king, and has threatened war over it. Thorvald Stauning has personally expressed that they are willing to reform their government in doing so and take on a revolutionary outlook, which would conform to membership in our alliance. They will open a solid northern front if they can hold out long enough. Already, negotiations are beginning between the Danish government and the primary socialist party in Denmark, the Kommunistisk Føderation, two members of whom had signed the Maximist Charter several years ago: Martin Andersen Nexø and Børge Houmann.\n\nShould the Danish government agree to this demand and adapt their government to a syndicalist system of sorts in the following months, their membership in the Internationale is only a boon towards crippling the wings of the German eagle."
 denmark_events.53.a: "Agree to their request, on the condition that they follow through with reform."
 denmark_events.53.b: "Crypto-syndicalists do not belong in our alliance, reject them."

 denmark_events.54.t: "The French Agree"
 denmark_events.54.d: "The French have come back to our request, requiring significant reforms moving Denmark to a syndicalist system. It may not be the most appealing option, but the reality is Denmark stands no chance in a war against Germany on our own. Føderationen has replied positively towards being invited to form a government, decisively dissolving Socialdemokratiet as a major party, with much of the party splitting. Half of the party, the moderates, will join Radikale Venstre and form the official opposition to a new government run by the Kommunistisk Føderation, with the other half joining in a new 'Stauningerne' wing.\n\nThorvald Stauning has declared too that a new congress will come, elected by members of parliament, to a 'Statsraad Congress', which is a fusion of his pluralist ideals and socialist reform. For now, though, Stauning has been ushered in as provisional Prime Minister-President before this congress can be called. Not all is well amongst the military, with much of the old guard coalescing around the opinions of Erik With and William Prior. Catastrophically, both men turned in their resignation, declaring that despite Stauning's claims, democracy is officially dead in Denmark."

 denmark_events.55.a: "Welcome, brothers!"

 denmark_events.56.t: "Formation of the New Government"
 denmark_events.56.d: "The entry of our nation into the Internationale has rigorously disrupted the natural order of Denmark, with the country having been transformed into a syndicalist republic from that of a monarchy in mere weeks. Significant amounts of backlash, as well as riots, have broken out, especially amongst supporters of KF, and the Konservative Ungdom (Young Conservatives) led by Jack Westergaard. The Danish police and significant military support have been dispatched in the wake of this crisis. However, it is the least of our problems as the war with Germany is on our doorstep. Føderationen leaders have met with Thorvald Stauning, including Martin Andersen Nexø and Børge Houmann of the Kommunarders, Richard Jensen and Christian Christensen of Enhedspartiet, and Aksel Larsen of the DVSP.\n\nHastily organising a congress of this size is no easy feat, but over the next few weeks, we shall determine who will guide us through these turbulent times."
 denmark_events.56.a: "The congress shall be held soon."

 denmark_events.57.t: "Reactionary Backlash Engulfs Copenhagen!"
 denmark_events.57.d: "Disastrous news has been reported from the streets of Copenhagen. Leaders of the opposition, in particular the autocratic wing of the People's Conservative Party, have launched protests across the capital city today. While constitutionalist leader, John Christmas Møller, has objected to the violence, calling the party to bide its time and await the revolution to snuff itself out, Jack Westergaard has instead sent the Konservative Ungdom (Young Conservatives) to incite the government and demand the arrest of syndicalist traitors. These riots, in combination with tacit support from the far-right leaders Arne Sørensen and Max Arildskov, have transformed the city into a battleground, with a serious effort required to put down this insurrection.\n\nWhile banning these parties and outright jailing their leaders is out of the picture, our country now sits in turmoil as we begin to combat this threat. Amidst the chaos, military leaders loyal to the cause with sympathies towards our plight have been hastily promoted and the position at the head of our command now sits with Marshal Svend Wagner. Generals HJC Andersen and Villy Fuglsang were promoted not long after, fleshing out our sorry state of military command following the retirement of our most influential generals."
 denmark_events.57.a: "Traitors, a threat to the revolution, dissidents against the republic..."

 denmark_events.58.t: "The Question of the Monarchy"
 denmark_events.58.d: "Successful negotiations have left Denmark at a standstill, having not officially declared a republic, and standing so far without a king. There are two main options with popular support, though by different individuals in government. The first option is simple: Frederik shall inherit the throne as Frederik IX and Denmark shall continue as a constitutional monarchy. Frederik is a pliable and agreeable king and would accept reduced power over the throne. He will bolster Denmark greatly as he is also popular with the people. Crowning Frederik as king would also appease the conservative opposition, as the second option would likely drum up unrest.\n\nThe second option is to abolish the monarchy altogether and declare Denmark a liberal, democratic republic, bound within Stauning's clauses of the Statsraad reforms. Such a move is supported by radical members of Socialdemokratiet and much of the party and coalition, which would essentially transform the Danish political scene into that of a two-party system, locked between Socialdemokratiet and Radikale Venstre. The idea of abolishing the monarchy and also sidelining their ability to run in government through unpopularity has driven a divide in the opposition, calling us no better than the syndicalists. Many high ranking generals including Marshal Prior may resign in protest as well, citing distrust in a republican future for Denmark.\n\nThe final decision rests on Stauning's shoulders, what should he present to his cabinet?"

 denmark_events.64.d: "Three-quarters of a century ago, the wretched Germans took the Duchy of Schleswig-Holstein and claimed it for their own, leaving many Danes under German rule. Unsurprisingly, Danish radicals, primarily Det Nye Danmark, but to an extent also the Dansk Samling and the Kommunarder Clique of Føderationen, have ratcheted up their rhetoric on this day.\n\nThe ND has even organised a large feast 'to celebrate the impending liberation of Slesvig'. This growth of revanchism is most worrisome."

 denmark_events.70.d: "Exactly 20 years ago, disgruntled anarchists and syndicalists raided the Copenhagen Stock Exchange, also known as 'Børsen'. Among syndicalist circles, it is fondly remembered as the day Denmark came closest to the revolution, and unsurprisingly, with this questionable anniversary, they are organising several activities in remembrance of those who were arrested there. Many in Føderationen have boycotted such celebrations, not wanting to incite a riot in the capital but some famed syndicalists were remembered for this raid. Figures such as Christian Christensen and Thøger Thøgersen were arrested during this raid which followed a large scale protest of tens of thousands. Many received fines while only several were arrested, today known as one of the most ridiculously underpunished crimes in recent history."

Many politicians hold speeches today, and most people have half the day off. This day marks a significant step towards Danish democracy and the establishment of the Danish monarch as a constitutional one. Across Denmark, many families have gathered for picnics and spent their half day off with their loved ones, as well as gathering in parks and on beaches across the country. The Danish flag flies proudly, though much of the far-right and far-left within Denmark have remained silent; today is a day for celebrating and not for fighting."

Henceforth, the Rigsdag's functions will be taken over by the new Statsraad, which will be elected by the Rigsdag. This system will conform itself to the French model of governance; however, disagreements are erupting within Føderationen. Today the vote will be held on the handling of Danish relations towards the Internationale: the Kommunarders stand for strong relations with the Third Internationale, while the syndicalists have offered a compromise and are rallying for a normalisation of efforts to reconcile Denmark with the Internationale. On the other hand, Stauning and Larsen stand in agreement that the alliance is a necessity, and strong ties to France and Britain are unnecessary, rather a means to an end for Denmark's survival.\n\nAt the end of the day, the victor in this debate is..."

Lines have been drawn across the delegates, with a few major parties backing several ways to handle this issue, led by the surprise DVSP-Enhedspartiet agreement that Denmark should adapt a syndicalised economy posthaste and immediately bring freedom to the workers with a transition that holds their best interests. Opposed to this lie the Kommunarders, who have staunchly advocated for a state-owned economy, one with direct influence and control, which could rapidly militarise the Danish industry for war. Unsurprisingly, the Stauningers have petitioned for a slower, scaled transition into a syndicalised economy, hoping at best to remain with a mixed-market economy until Denmark is ready for this type of reform.\n\nAt the end of the day, the victor in this debate is..."

Devoutly, the Kommunarders and Enhedspartiet are in agreement: the reactionary traitors must be purged and arrested, their parties banned, and much of their leadership jailed if they do not acquiesce to these demands. Unsurprisingly, this has caused quite a lot of unrest in Føderationen, where the DVSP have announced that a softer hand and the building of Føderationen's popularity rests on governmental goodwill, yet has held in agreement that these parties serve no purpose in this syndicalist system. Stauning and his supporters have argued vehemently against the thorough suppression of selected parties, instead welcoming Peter Munch to lead an official opposition made up of Radikale Venstre and the other parties in a subverted coalition.\n\nAt the end of the day, the victor in this debate is..."

Standing across from them are the DVSP, who have announced plans for the formation of a mass party, one that would lead to increasing control over the state itself. The Kommunarders, unsurprisingly, have declared their support for a centralised government with power resting at the very top of party leadership, around the Prime Minister-President and a cadre of trusted officials.\n\nAt the end of the day, the victory in this debate is..."

It was not easy for Stauning to come to such a decision, and in the end, he may forever regret betraying his party line and ideals in favour of protecting Danish sovereignty. Prior to the election, Stauning gave one final speech, declaring that Danish citizens should relish the newfound stability and certainty provided by such elections, and that whoever becomes Prime Minister-President of Denmark shall wield that power responsibly.

Having switched between being a member of the government, primary leader of the opposition, and even prime minister, he has surely pressed his mark onto Danish politics. Venstre has been swift to announce Knud Kristensen as the new leader of the party; it will surely be challenging for him to match this illustrious leader of the Danish right."
 denmark_events.85.a: "Politics aside, we wish him well."

 denmark_events.86.t: "Denmark Offers an Economic Deal"
 denmark_events.86.d: "Our small neighbour Denmark has been hit hard by the same economic crisis that has hit our nation. In an attempt to soften the blow, the Danish government seeks to make the import of Danish goods more attractive. To that end, they want to lower the exchange rate of the Danish Krone to our Mark, two currencies that are pegged to each other within the Mitteleuropa system. In return for our cooperation, the Danish state offers to buy additional German goods as compensation."
 denmark_events.86.a: "A sensible deal, go ahead!"

 denmark_events.87.t: "Germany Accepts Our Deal"
 denmark_events.87.d: "The German government has accepted our offer to buy additional German goods from the market if they'll cooperate in our endeavour to lower the Krone in value compared to the Mark, which has been pegged to the Krone since the Weltkrieg."
 denmark_events.87.a: "Good, this will aid the recovery!"

 denmark_events.89.t: "The Founding of 'Lego'"
 denmark_events.89.d: "The woodworking shop of Billund carpenter Ole Kirk Christiansen had been going through a rough time during the last year: due to the economic crisis that hit Denmark, fewer customers ordered furniture in the once-prospering carpentry workshop. Christiansen therefore decided to focus on smaller projects and started to produce toys for kids. While the process has not been extremely profitable, with most customers paying in kind, it has allowed the workshop to stay afloat, and the toys - now being shipped under the brand 'Lego', a contraction of 'Leg godt', 'play well' - are growing in popularity throughout Denmark as well as in Schleswig-Holstein, and profits are rising."
 denmark_events.89.a: "Shall it be called 'Lego' or 'Legio' perhaps?"

 denmark_events.91.t: "Seeking German Protection?"
 denmark_events.91.d: "Disturbingly, both Norway and Sweden have shortly after each other fallen to Syndicalism, and undoubtedly they are now looking at destroying our status quo as well, together with those in Denmark sympathising with their cause. King Christian X has met with [GetSecondInCommand] declaring that they should immediately join into an alliance with Germany posthaste, lest Denmark fall to revolutions such as theirs. However, [GetSecondInCommand] reassured King Christian X, declaring that Denmark shall take no urgent action and in its neutrality should Denmark find prosperity, with little evidence that socialist movements in Denmark have close to the support that they do in Sweden and Norway, and that Denmark is in itself without crisis.\n\nDisturbingly, this has caused King Christian X to meet with members of the autocratic wing of KF, announcing support for a cabinet led by Pürschel should things understandably come crumbling down. While the king is in no position to utterly dismiss the government over this event, this should cause some caution for our governance should a weakness be displayed in the future."
 denmark_events.91.a: "Foreign policy is to be determined by a responsible government, not by nepotism!"

 denmark_events.92.t: "August Uproar"
 denmark_events.92.d: "Riots have started to take place as exhaustion about the prolonged state of war Denmark has found itself in keeps dragging on. This month especially, the unrest has been growing: starting in Odense, the demonstrations have spilled over to other cities in Denmark, including Funen, Esbjerg, Aalborg, and Aarhus. Fortunately, Copenhagen seems to be calm, but it is clear that the appetite for war is running out."
 denmark_events.92.a: "We have almost won, I assure you!"

 denmark_events.93.t: "Syndikalistloven"
 denmark_events.93.d: "The 'Law no. 349 on Prohibition of Syndicalist Associations and against Syndicalist Trade Unions' will be voted on in the Folketing, calling for the complete prohibition of syndicalist activities, specifically those of the 'Kommunistisk Føderation', on the grounds that this hurts state security and that these trade unions support our enemy.\n\nDespite the circumstances at hand, the law is controversial, as some jurists have called out the law as a violation of the freedom of association as enshrined in our constitution."
 denmark_events.93.a: "The law passes despite the controversy."
 denmark_events.93.b: "The law fails, letting syndicalists still operate."

 denmark_events.94.t: "The Danish Statsraad System"
 denmark_events.94.d: "The question of Danish neutrality came to a head recently, as the pro-German King Christian X was forced to abdicate by the Stauning cabinet. This prompted German threats which would have practically led to the end of Danish neutrality regardless.\n\nIn an unlikely twist of fate, this has prompted Denmark to seek protection from the Third Internationale - a request that Paris and London have accepted, in exchange for Denmark formally adopting a socialist system. For now, this has safeguarded Danish independence, but it has also put them on an inevitable collision course with their more powerful southern neighbour."
 denmark_events.94.a: "A stab in the back like no other."
 denmark_events.94.b: "They'll regret this when German boots march into Copenhagen."
 denmark_events.94.c: "The beginnings of a truly free Denmark are at hand."

 denmark_events.940.t: "Proclamation of the Danish People's Republic"
 denmark_events.940.d: "After the abdication of King Christian X, many looked to Frederik to take the throne and reign, but instead Thorvald Stauning has announced the creation of the Danish People's Republic and has announced the end of the constitutional monarchy in Denmark.\n\nA new election is being held to determine the new Prime Minister-President of Denmark, with the likely candidacy of Thorvald Stauning aiming to win this election and secure his rule over a moderate Danish republic. Many onlookers have criticised Stauning's decision; however, with the upheaval that led to Christian X's abdication, Stauning has openly declared that Danish democracy shall function as fair and as free as ever without a monarch interfering in its politics."
 denmark_events.940.a: "Stauning or chaos, Denmark is in good hands."
 denmark_events.940.b: "Very moderate, this revolution is."
 denmark_events.940.c: "Idealism has reached the Jutland peninsula at last."

 denmark_events.95.t: "Resurgence of Danish Conservatism"
 denmark_events.95.d: "As war in Europe looks increasingly likely day by day, the small Reichspakt-aligned nation of Denmark has been in a crisis of its own. The Danish parliament has been ousted after investigations of corruption and misuse of power. Fed up with the inability of his government to reach a satisfactory conclusion, King Christian X, with the backing of the Konservative Folkeparti, dissolved the democratic institutions of Denmark and has thrown the full weight of Danish society behind the Reichspakt's interests.\nWidespread protests have taken place all across the nation as the newly appointed conservative government cements its rule. While this decision comes as a shock to almost all who have been watching the Danish situation, there is no question now where the loyalties of the Jutland peninsula lie."
 denmark_events.95.a: "Denmark pivots to the right, once more."
 denmark_events.95.b: "No matter, the Danish revolution shall be at hand soon enough."

 denmark_events.96.t: "The Constitutional Crisis Erupts"
 denmark_events.96.d: "[GetSecondInCommand] has made the headlines in the papers today after presenting a referendum to be voted on by the Danish populace in the next few months. [DEN_get_crisis_pov_loc] While news of a referendum has spread across the country, King Christian X has decided to use this opportunity to demand the changes made in this referendum include that of closer German alignment.\n\n[GetSecondInCommand] decidedly objected to such an amendment; however, King Christian X leveraged his reserve powers to threaten the government into acting. For the government to survive this tenuous situation, they must decide whether or not to oblige the king, lest risk his wrath."
 denmark_events.96.a: "Support the king, Denmark must prepare to fight alongside Germany."
 denmark_events.96.b: "We must resist this pressure; Denmark shall not be subservient to the Kaiserreich."

 denmark_events.97.t: "The Question of Democracy"
 denmark_events.97.d: "Victor Pürschel has met with King Christian X today discussing the issue of democracy which has recently re-entered the public consciousness following the success of Denmark and their allies in the Weltkrieg. Utilising his royal authority, Victor Pürschel was appointed to lead Denmark alongside the autocratic wing of the KF following a disastrous display of governance in [GetYear], and his rule has been legitimised both by the king and the looming European war. However, now that the war has ended and Denmark finds itself safe and at peace, many in the KF and in the opposition are requesting a return to free elections.\n\nCiting the precedence of past crises solved by the king appointing a suitable Prime Minister, elections resumed at a comfortable pace; however, things are different now compared to then. Stauning showed his true colours by betraying the country and joining the vile syndicalists, with many in Victor Pürschel's camp agreeing that a period of continued authoritarian rule until Denmark can be prepared for democracy would be necessary. Thomas Madsen-Mygdal, on the other hand, has argued for a restoration of democracy but only under government-approved parties, disallowing even the moderate left of what remains within Socialdemokratiet.\n\nTo further this regime, Victor Pürschel has announced the creation of an entirely new party, the Nye Højre or New Right. He has cited that his movement has gone beyond simply being a wing of the KF, and in order to strengthen his position, a full reorganisation of the party must begin to cement right-wing rule over Denmark. This decision has been met with great displeasure from the KF, but these past years have seen a rise in support for Pürschel and there is little opposition to this move.\n\nAll eyes are on the king and Victor Pürschel's cabinet to decide the fate of Denmark."
 denmark_events.97.a: "Elections shall remain suspended... for now."
 denmark_events.97.b: "Møller is right; elections will be held once more."

 denmark_events.98.t: "Elections of [getYear]"
 denmark_events.98.d: "The time has come for Danish elections once more and three parties have organised to run to rule Denmark for the next three years as per the constitution states. King Christian X has approved for Venstre to run in coalition with Radikale Venstre, having restored a 'liberal coalition' of sorts after Stauning's disgrace and the fall of their coalition. Also in the running is the newly reformed KF spearheaded by Møller, with Venstre as their junior partner should he win the election in order to form a majority in parliament. Having spearheaded the push for the restoration of free elections, Møller has become a popular choice for the people.\n\nLastly, Victor Pürschel has decided to run in these elections as well, stirring unrest from the far left and the opposition as this unorthodox entry pleases many who fell in support of him and the autocratic wing of the KF following the constitutional crisis. Victor Pürschel announced that this election would be 'free and fair' amongst the participating parties, but many have criticised his decision to run, especially since he has faith from the king to rule.\n\nThe ballots are in, and the winner is..."
 denmark_events.98.a: "A Liberal Coalition led by Venstre."
 denmark_events.98.b: "Unified KF with Venstre as a junior partner."
 denmark_events.98.c: "Pürschel and the Nye Højre."

 denmark_events.99.t: "Expanded Public Works Projects"
 denmark_events.99.d: "[GetSecondInCommand] has met with the combined cabinets of the left and the right to discuss the increase of investments towards funding Public Works Projects across Denmark. This initiative, which spearheaded the recovery from the economic crisis several years ago, performed admirably, and [GetSecondInCommand] has presented several increases in these projects towards the next annual budget. While not an entirely unreachable cost, such increases will put a slight strain on the Danish economy but will benefit both its growth and continued endurance into the coming decades. The opposition has proposed its own version of the budget, which compromises on much of [GetSecondInCommand]'s proposals by a moderate amount. At the end of the day..."
 denmark_events.99.a: "...the Radical Proposal passes."
 denmark_events.99.b: "...the watered-down Compromise Proposal is passed."

 denmark_events.100.t: "Focus on Healthcare Improvements"
 denmark_events.100.d: "Today, [GetSecondInCommand] has met with the combined cabinets of the left and the right to discuss the issue of healthcare, which has grown in awareness the past 2 decades within debates concerning equity and quality of care. [GetSecondInCommand] has presented the need for a new Childcare Act, which will finally solidify the issue of the need for maternity care and child health programmes. Mother's Aid Centres would be further expanded across the country and provide aid to families who are struggling after the weight of the economic crisis to raise their child or children. [GetSecondInCommand] has also proposed entire new acts regarding increased vaccinations for children, sanatoriums for patients with tuberculosis, and an investment into schooling for training healthcare professionals.\n\nThe opposition fired back, declaring that much of the improvements, while helpful, will be such a drain on government funding, and the removal of superfluous acts and restriction of adding only the necessities should be enough. At the end of the day..."
 denmark_events.100.a: "...the Radical Proposal passes."
 denmark_events.100.b: "...the watered-down Compromise Proposal is passed."

 denmark_events.101.t: "Expansion of Pensions"
 denmark_events.101.d: "[GetSecondInCommand] has met with the combined cabinets of the left and the right to discuss the increase of pensions across the board as advised by K.K. Steincke's New Social Laws. This set of laws includes the implementation of expanded pensions for old age and those who are sick or unfit to work, and would be a massive boon to support for Denmark's welfare state programme. Opposition leader Thomas Madsen-Mygdal has denounced such a radical increase in the investment for pensions, claiming that the state budget will be reduced too far and they will only accept a proposal in which the increases are minimal and scale with the current state budget, as to not overextend oneself. At the end of the day..."

 denmark_events.102.t: "Dealing with Antimilitarists"
 denmark_events.102.d: "[GetSecondInCommand] has met with the combined cabinets of the coalition to discuss the issue of antimilitarists, which are ever present in both parties. Peter Munch and the Radikale Venstre stand quite poised against any expelling of those elements or toning down their influence in the party, as they were a key issue which led to the dissolution of their alignment to Venstre, and as such have outright threatened to leave the coalition should [GetSecondInCommand] propose radical purges. To gain their support in the event of a war, [GetSecondInCommand] has proposed a radical plan to slightly limit the number of young Danish men to be recruited into the army, with further compensation provided. This proposal is tacitly approved on by the opposition, but heavily vetoed by those who support Munch's rhetoric. At the end of the day..."

 denmark_events.103.t: "The New Welfare Bureaucracy"
 denmark_events.103.d: "[GetSecondInCommand] has met with the combined cabinets of the left and the right to discuss an expansion towards or possibly a brand-new bureaucracy for the up-and-coming welfare state in Denmark. Particularly the matter of those staffing the bureaucracy and the percentage of politicians from each party being committed has caused an issue with the opposition, who seek to limit the state budget expansion towards the welfare state, declaring that it will throw the nation into chaos. [GetSecondInCommand] and Socialdemokratiet are at a crossroads: shall they push on with majority control and greatly expand into a streamlined large bureaucracy, or give in to the coalition for the sake of compromise...? At the end of the day..."
 denmark_events.103.a: "...the Radical Proposal passes."
 denmark_events.103.b: "...the watered-down Compromise Proposal is passed."

 denmark_events.104.t: "Oppositional Pressure Surmounts the Coalition"
 denmark_events.104.d: "Disturbing news has reached the desk of [GetSecondInCommand] as Venstre and KF have officially announced the vetoing of the upcoming year end budgetary vote, as well as withdrawing all support for the government, as they feel Stauning's spending for welfare reforms has gone too far. While they do not hold an official grip in the Rigsdag, Venstre-KF leadership have demanded Stauning's resignation in the face of yet another impending coalition defeat due to a failed budgetary vote. King Christian X summoned [GetSecondInCommand] and has declared that the government could not continue on its own, and lest they hold snap elections, a crisis may erupt yet again.\n\nAlready, Stauning's leadership has come under question and many in the coalition are seeing an oppositional resurgence in a snap election as detriment to the development of the welfare state. Instead, perhaps Peter Munch's renewed leadership over the coalition may appease the opposition."
 denmark_events.104.a: "It seems we are in for a repeat of 1926."

 denmark_events.105.t: "The Deadline Looms"
 denmark_events.105.d: "Days have passed since the crisis in cabinet has surfaced and many across the spectrum have proposed wild solutions. The radicals within Socialdemokratiet are strongly denying Stauning's resignation and instead want to double down, which would only further incite a combative response from the opposition. On the other hand, Radikale Venstre has declared that with support from Socialdemokratiet, they could chair the coalition with Peter Munch taking over as Prime Minister which would cool tensions, but ultimately draw back support for driving towards the envisioned welfare state. Negotiations are being held across the coalition, and there seems to be only one conclusion in mind..."
 denmark_events.105.a: "Perhaps we should entrust faith in Peter Munch"

 denmark_events.106.t: "Stauning Announces Resignation"
 denmark_events.106.d: "In the face of pressure from the opposition and even the king whose watchful eye has always been over Stauning for the past decade, long-time running Prime Minister Thorvald Stauning has announced his resignation. Popular support from the opposition has bottomed out his dreams for a steady approach towards a domineering flagship welfare state, and this repeat on failures to negotiate bipartisan support has cost him. Following this exchange, foreign minister Peter Munch has taken the reigns as Prime Minister and has announced levying back several of the reforms in favour of a slow and steady approach, one that has netted oppositional support for the upcoming year end budgetary vote.\n\nWhile Peter Munch's stewardship marks a return for Radikale Venstre dominance in the moderate left coalition, it also represents a worrying resurgence for opposition support, who may drive to win the next election off of the backs of this failure."
 denmark_events.106.a: "If only we had been more careful..."

 denmark_events.107.t: "Germany Wants to Negotiate"
 denmark_events.107.d: "Germany has acquiesced to hearing us out and ignoring the demands of our former King Christian X. Stauning and his cabinet breathe a sigh of relief, with Germany listening to reason. Hopefully, the German demands will not be too harsh, but seeing as how the ball is in their court, it is almost likely that, outside of directly joining the war on their behalf, Germany will dispense severe demands upon the Danish nation. Stauning has met with his cabinet and they are preparing to receive and agree to however many demands that exist, as long as they do not impede on Danish independence."
 denmark_events.107.a: "Let us hope the German demands are reasonable."

 denmark_events.108.t: "Demands over Military Access"
 denmark_events.108.d: "The first round of negotiations has begun, and the issue of Denmark as a strategic military outpost has come up for debate. Denmark sits at a very strategic position, with the Internationale and the Russian alliance having easy access through their straits, should Denmark remain absolutely neutral. This proves to be a great security risk for our northern flank, leaving our vulnerable northern coast ripe for invasion and raiding by the enemy submarine fleets.\n\nTwo possible demands have surfaced on either end of the spectrum: Firstly, we could demand Denmark give up access for German troops to cross as well as letting the Kriegsmarine dock and use Danish ports, a reasonable demand considering the war that is to occur on either side of them. Secondly, we could demand that Denmark formally join the Reichspakt, though creating limits on their participation in the war. This would guarantee that the Russians and the Internationale would be prevented from crossing through the Danish strait.\n\nWhich demand should we levy towards the Danish government?"
 denmark_events.108.a: "Demand Military Access, and nothing further."
 denmark_events.108.b: "The Straits are too valuable... betray their wishes for neutrality."

 denmark_events.109.b: "Absolutely not, veto these negotiations at once."

 denmark_events.110.t: "Demands over Diverted Trade and Economic Control"
 denmark_events.110.d: "The second round of negotiations has begun, and many are calling to place strategic control over Danish trade and their economy, though the latter is heavily up for debate. There are those who see Denmark as small and insignificant, but also prone to act should their independence be called into question, as we have witnessed with the ousting of King Christian X due to his scandal. Therefore, a moderate proposal has been drafted in which Denmark would allow goods to be purchased at a lower cost, as well as diverting a significant amount of trade to German markets, in a way that still maintains their trade ties to other nations but at a steeper cost.\n\nOn the other end, many are debating the lease of several Danish factories, though such a demand would come with the concern that it would alienate the Danish even further. While several factories would do little to add to the German war machine and booming industry, this demand would be partly symbolic, to show that the Danes are not wholly privy to be perfectly neutral once more.\n\nWhich set of demands should we levy towards the Danish government?"
 denmark_events.110.a: "Demand redirected trade."
 denmark_events.110.b: "Demand redirected trade... as well as lease of many Danish factories."

 denmark_events.111.a: "We accept these demands."
 denmark_events.111.b: "Absolutely not, veto these negotiations at once."

 denmark_events.112.t: "Success of Negotiations"
 denmark_events.112.d: "With the primary issues out of the way, the Danish have agreed to each and every one of our demands. While it is unfortunate that Denmark cannot militarily join our alliance, lest we force their hand and likely alienate them, we have gained significant amounts of economic control and military access to Denmark, and we can breathe a sigh of relief as relations with the new Danish state normalise once more."
 denmark_events.112.a: "The pen is indeed mightier than the sword."

 denmark_events.113.t: "Negotiations Have Succeeded"
 denmark_events.113.d: "Stauning and his cabinet met, after Stauning gave a speech in Copenhagen announcing that Danish sovereignty has been protected, in a treaty that signs Danish neutrality in the face of several demands. Most citizens have responded jubilantly, and antimilitarists in both parties have been sated severely, having feared that Denmark would be brought into the war in some form or way."
 denmark_events.113.a: "Denmark's neutrality has been secured."

 denmark_events.114.t: "Negotiations Break Down"
 denmark_events.114.d: "Negotiations have taken a turn for the worse, whether or not the demands we levied were too harsh or not, the Danish government has spat in our face and vetoed the negotiations as a whole. They have publicly declared us to be tyrants seeking to turn Denmark into another German puppet state like those we have established in the east, and have decried that Danish neutrality and sovereignty is non-negotiable. There is nothing else for us to do but demand Denmark submit and acquiesce to Christian's demands prior; it was a mistake to open negotiations with our small neighbour."
 denmark_events.114.a: "The sword wins out in the end, demand the reinstatement of King Christian!"

 denmark_events.115.t: "Jensen vs Christensen"
 denmark_events.115.d: "Enhedspartiet's victory in the congress has come about a serious question: who shall be chosen to lead the country as Prime Minister-President of Denmark? Christensen has taken formal standing, though with the party split along lines divided between the Young Guard led by Richard Jensen and the backbone of the party in the Old Guard led by Christian Christensen, a new vote has taken place to determine who shall lead Denmark. Richard Jensen took the podium first, and with the backing of Søfyrbødernes Forbund, has riled the crowd up with declarations for a call to arms and for a reinvigoration of the Danish shipping industry which calls for increased rights and wages for our fellow seamen. On the other podium stood Christian Christensen, nominally supported by the FS, who has declared that every worker shall receive equal and better treatment under the expansion and establishment of the Union of Trade Unions, staffed by loyal and capable members of his Old Guard.\n\nThe race has been tight, and the two figures have an even chance of coming out on top. Jensen and Christensen share a commonality in an impoverished childhood, which has bolstered their friendship as well as camaraderie. At the end of the day though, only one man can win this vote, and the winner is..."

 denmark_events.116.t: "Opening of the Moderate Statsraad Congress"
 denmark_events.116.d: "In accordance with plans made to transform Denmark into a liberal republic, elections to the Statsraad Congress have begun. The Rigsdag shall elect members of the new Statsraad Congress, which in turn will settle on deciding the new Prime Minister-President of Denmark. Staffed with electing mainly members of Socialdemokratiet and Radikale Venstre, as proportional representation looks down on the opposition's chances, the upcoming election will prove to be a tumultuous one. On one hand, Thorvald Stauning is almost certain to win this election, having navigated the past crises with a high degree of charisma and political manoeuvring, though one must not count out Peter Munch of Radikale Venstre.\n\nWithin days, both delegates will meet to debate several issues which will shape their campaigns."
 denmark_events.116.a: "This marks the birth of Denmark as a republic."

 denmark_events.117.t: "Welfare Reforms Debate"
 denmark_events.117.d: "The first debate which has entered the public consciousness is to do with the welfare state reforms. Both Peter Munch and Thorvald Stauning are present, and have formerly agreed on the continuation of said reforms in Stauning's vision, but division has just broken now that the two stand on either end. Peter Munch has denounced Stauning's plans to continue implementing the Danish welfare state for many reasons, and those in Radikale Venstre agree most that the rate at which Denmark accelerates is far too fast and the Danish economy will suffer as a result.\n\nCounter to this, Thorvald Stauning has decried that without his plans and public works programme, as well as reforms to healthcare to make it universal, Denmark could never have escaped the economic crisis as well as it had done several years ago. Stauning's plans are popular and numerous, but the cautious opposition has been reinvigorated with supporters who formerly supported Venstre and the KF, and have strengthened Munch's resolve. Who will come out on top?"
 denmark_events.117.a: "Stauning's ideals are too great."
 denmark_events.117.b: "Munch's cautious optimism wins them over."

 denmark_events.118.t: "Militarisation in the Public Conscious"
 denmark_events.118.d: "Militarisation is a hot budget issue, and though Thorvald Stauning and Peter Munch already hold pretty similar views, the degree in which Denmark demilitarises is up for debate. Peter Munch is staunch in his views that the Danish military should be defunded, and up until abolishment, disentangled from being viewed as a necessity. 'Hvad skal det nytte' or 'What is the use of it all' is a famous slogan inspired by Peter Munch on this issue, and has comically been noted by the general staff.\n\nAgainst this issue, Stauning has not notably dismissed much of Munch's points but has decried that Denmark should have armed forces in turbulent times such as these simply to protect itself in case of intervention from the other radical powers, such as the eastern bloc around Russia, or should the Internationale decide to betray Danish neutrality as a launch point for invasion. Both men make good points in regards to their campaigns, but only one man can come out on top..."
 denmark_events.118.a: "Stauning is right, we must be wary."
 denmark_events.118.b: "'Hvad skal det nytte', Munch's motto holds true."

 denmark_events.119.t: "Role of the Prime Minister-President"
 denmark_events.119.d: "Concerning the role of the newfound leadership spot, the Prime Minister-President, is not a wholly contentious debate, and has not sparked such significant discussion as the prior two issues have done. Instead, Peter Munch has proposed offering the role some sort of veto and extended power within law-making, citing that in times of trouble for the new republic, decisive action must be made. Thorvald Stauning has all but turned down this suggestion, reminding Munch that the king held powers not too dissimilar from these, and that those powers remained a steady threat by the king who kept wary of their governance, and almost led to the fall of his very own cabinet.\n\nThe Prime Minister-President is a representative not only of the Statsraad Congress but also of the parliament, and shall adhere to it, is what Stauning has proclaimed and has won more than enough popular support to win this debate. However, the people may sway to the emergent thought of Munch and his concerns. Who should win this debate?"
 denmark_events.119.a: "Stauning rallies the people with his charisma."
 denmark_events.119.b: "Munch's concerns shine through."

 denmark_events.120.t: "Final Results of the Election"
 denmark_events.120.d: "After many debates and days of voting, as well as a meeting between Thorvald Stauning and Peter Munch in preparation for the announcement of results, the tallies are finally in. Should Thorvald Stauning win the election, the continuation of reforms shall prove fruitful and Denmark shall spiral forth into possibly becoming the shining example of a welfare state. However, if Peter Munch wins, Stauning will have to wait many more years, perhaps up to more than a decade, to see this dream of a welfare state come to life. At the end of the day, the results are in and..."
 denmark_events.120.a: "Thorvald Stauning is victorious!"
 denmark_events.120.b: "In a surprise victory, Peter Munch!"

 denmark_events.121.t: "The Future of Danish Neutrality"
 denmark_events.121.d: "With the fall of the German sphere, the Kaiser has fled far beyond our radar, and a new government has been propped up in Berlin by a foreign power. We are now at odds against the world and many questions have been raised about what we could possibly do. We could try to parlay with the socialists, ask for protection against them by aligning us towards Moscow, or perhaps a friendly neighbour would allow us mutual defence. The final alternative, should we have no other choice, is to fortify our neutrality, turn Denmark into an impregnable fortress, and exert more than a little instability on our quaint nation by introducing a state of alertness which would require hefty conscription and militarisation that would prove unsavoury towards the antimilitarists in our nation.\n\nThe choice is ours alone; what shall we do?"

 denmark_events.121.e: "Sweden is in a similar position to us, send a petition."

 denmark_events.122.t: "The Danish Request"
 denmark_events.122.d: "After having conquered the German sphere and liberated its territories as well as those of its allies and subjects, an envoy has just arrived from Copenhagen, Denmark. They have requested protection, now that their neutrality has run them between our forces and that of a possible threat to their continued livelihood. While we have no pressure to give in to their request, the Danish government has presented the offer of access through their straits and the ability to stage military and naval positions across Denmark, should we respect their independence. This offers a tough choice, as Denmark is weak and our forces overwhelm theirs.\n\nConsidering their offer, is Denmark worth wasting valuable attention that we could be relocating towards the rest of the world?"
 denmark_events.122.a: "Agree to their request; they are not worth our time."
 denmark_events.122.b: "Refuse, Denmark's liberation is at hand!"

 denmark_events.123.t: "Back to Square One"
 denmark_events.123.d: "Our envoys have failed and negotiations have broken down. For whatever reason, it seems we must reconsider our options."
 denmark_events.123.a: "Back to the drawing board..."

 denmark_events.124.t: "The Danish Request"
 denmark_events.124.d: "Surprisingly, a request from the small Nordic nation of Denmark has arrived with a request to join our alliance. Having upheld their neutrality through a political crisis which led to the abdication of King Christian X, Denmark has come out of the Weltkrieg with their neutrality intact but their position vulnerable. There is little reason to deny their request, as allying Denmark blocks our enemies from accessing the Baltic Sea and also provides a strategic military base. However, the choice is ours, and perhaps inviting Denmark would incite our enemies into further conflict."
 denmark_events.124.a: "Accept."
 denmark_events.124.b: "Refuse."

 denmark_events.125.t: "An Envoy from Copenhagen"
 denmark_events.125.d: "As the world collapses around us, with the German collapse and the new world order being established, it seems that our small neighbour has sent a petition regarding the defence of our two nations. While history may have been cruel in the past centuries, relations with Denmark have warmed to a point in which a treaty of mutual defence against the east and the west could be on the table. Should our nation be threatened, Denmark will come to our defence and vice versa, helping to ensure the survival of our two nations in a world that may seek our destruction. How should we reply to their petition?"
 denmark_events.125.a: "Agree, it is in our best interest to."
 denmark_events.125.b: "Refuse, Denmark isn't worth the trouble."

 denmark_events.1250.t: "The Internationale Accepts"
 denmark_events.1250.d: "It seems our envoy to the Internationale has borne fruit, and for now our security will be maintained, though this agreement is not permanent and should the tide of the revolution come to us, we should remain ready. For now though, a momentary calm has touched upon many in regards to our status in Europe."
 denmark_events.1250.a: "A tenuous friendship."

 denmark_events.1251.t: "Russia Accepts"
 denmark_events.1251.d: "Our envoy to Moscow has come back with agreement, Russia and Denmark shall now be aligned, and already Russian troops have been given leave in Copenhagen and several other cities. While this means we have a commitment to fight alongside Moscow in their upcoming wars, their protection will be greatly appreciated against any enemies threatening us in Europe and abroad."
 denmark_events.1251.a: "Better the devil you know..."

 denmark_events.1252.t: "Sweden Accepts"
 denmark_events.1252.d: "Sweden has graciously accepted our offer, and our two democracies will stand against the beasts of Europe ready to pounce on our pure Scandinavian neutrality. While our two armies alone may be little in terms of size and modernisation, together, we can strive to watch each other's backs in times of war."
 denmark_events.1252.a: "For our survival, we can put old feuds behind us."

 denmark_events.126.t: "Nordslesvig Joins Denmark"
 denmark_events.126.d: "Our decision to pursue neutrality has borne fruit in several ways, allowing our people to once again cherish neutrality. However, it seems that the protective sphere of the German Kaiserreich is on its last legs, and as such, the state of North Slesvig has turned itself over to our side. Danish troops crossed the border as soon as local regiments in North Slesvig signalled to border guards that a local referendum had been conducted, with a majority in favour of unity with Denmark to prevent their fall to foreign enemies. While Germany is likely to respond in kind, there is little to be done with the complete collapse of the German government and military in their ongoing war.\n\nA parade has been organised in Copenhagen to celebrate the overturning of the Treaty of Vienna which had separated Denmark from lands such as North Slesvig, and while a celebration is in turn, many look onto the possibility that Danish neutrality may end in the face of a new world order by hostile foreign powers."
 denmark_events.126.a: "Freden i Wien... finally overturned."

 denmark_events.127.t: "Nordschleswig Defects to Denmark"
 denmark_events.127.d: "Terrible news has arrived from the north. To make matters worse, Denmark has illegally accepted a local referendum in the state of Northern Schleswig and has nominally annexed the territory. Diplomatic ties have been cut with the neutral Danish state, which through negotiations formerly had agreed to several concessions in regards to their continued neutrality. This marks the end of all treaties concerning the Danish state, and short of an invasion, Northern Schleswig has slipped from our grasp. An invasion would only put matters far worse for our state of affairs, so there is simply nothing we can do."
 denmark_events.127.a: "Our country collapses bit by bit."

 denmark_events.128.t: "BOPA and Danmarks Frihedsråd Strike"
 denmark_events.128.d: "BOPA (Borgerlige Partisaner, Civil Partisans) and Danmarks Frihedsråd (Danish Freedom Council) have launched one of many attacks within the Copenhagen City Centre today, causing an uproar amongst the civil populace. [GetSecondInCommand] has met with the king in accordance with the latest efforts to seemingly overturn the Danish alliance with the Kaiserreich, one that they call enslavement to the German Kaiser and their war effort. On the mantra of so-called occupation by foreign forces, Børge Houmann, with primary support from the Kommunarder clique of Føderationen, have begun clandestine raids against armouries and have even begun acts of seemingly random terror across the civil populace.\n\nJoined to them is the Danish Freedom Council, an organised group of disgruntled politicians, military officials, and civilians alike across Denmark hoping to 'free' Denmark from German occupation, with the goal of joining the Internationale to the west or the Russians to the east, depending on who you ask. As of now, reserve units as well as the Danish military police have been deployed in tow, but BOPA and the Danish Freedom Council will serve as a serious thorn in our side as long as we remain at war."
 denmark_events.128.a: "Denmark will persevere!"

 denmark_events.129.t: "Marshal Prior Presents a Solution"
 denmark_events.129.d: "Marshal William Prior has met with [GetSecondInCommand] to discuss a suitable solution to the issue of BOPA and the Freedom Council's activities. Already, police units have been dispatched in order to attempt to quell the threat, round up ringleaders, and imprison these saboteurs, but with little success so far. Prior has led discussions about and organised an end to this threat to Denmark, and has presented two plans of action.\n\nThe first plan is to centralise the reserve units and police under army leadership. Prior has suggested General Ebbe Gørtz to handle this, which would, in time, be able to circumvent the problem before it gets any worse. The second plan is for Marshal Prior to take the reins himself. He would temporarily resign from duties fitting to him and lead a personal division of regiments he has handpicked and will crack down on any and all syndicalist traitors plaguing Denmark.\n\nThe choice is up to [GetSecondInCommand]. The former option would be far less damaging and would lead to far less civil unrest but take a considerable amount of time, while the second option starves Denmark of its Chief of Army for a time and will also cause significant unrest amongst the left. Føderationen may be enraged by this sudden clamping down on their activities, and it may only instigate further retaliation, but Marshal Prior would be able to handle this threat in a shorter amount of time. At the end of the day, which plan is chosen?"
 denmark_events.129.a: "Plan A: Organise Police and Reserve Units under Gørtz."
 denmark_events.129.b: "Plan B: Deploy Marshal Prior, Denmark's enemies shall fall!"

 denmark_events.130.t: "BOPA Ringleaders Apprehended"
 denmark_events.130.d: "Some BOPA and Danish Freedom Council ringleaders have been apprehended, which will put a toll on the effects of their resistance towards our government. This does not mark the end of armed resistance in Denmark, nor shall the conflict calm itself until the movement is utterly quelled and Denmark can look once more abroad. The efforts of our brave men hard at work will soon bear fruit, but for now, the fight rages on."
 denmark_events.130.a: "Soon we will escape this nightmare."

 denmark_events.131.t: "City Centre Attacked"
 denmark_events.131.d: "Disturbing news has arrived from Copenhagen as units under police supervision and reserve army command clashed with members of BOPA who launched an attack on the major city centre this day. Their goal seemed to be purely causing unrest and rallying the citizenry to their side, but they have been, insofar, unsuccessful in rallying locals to aid in their strike and protest. Unfortunately, many civilians were caught in the crossfire and several of our own men perished that day as conflict escalated, though it appears they were at least successful in ceasing violence at the end. Attacks like this will continue all over Denmark until we can finally catch and arrest these terrorists."
 denmark_events.131.a: "Terrible."

 denmark_events.132.t: "Factories Sabotaged"
 denmark_events.132.d: "Reports have arrived that BOPA has targeted several major factories across Denmark today. It seems that their plans caught the police team off guard and the saboteurs made off with severely damaging operations over a war materiel factory and a civil industrial complex. Reports of eyewitness accounts and from the workers at said factories confirmed that BOPA were the culprits, but there has been no luck in apprehending any of these criminals yet. Police units have been deployed to watch major routes and to try and prevent any future attacks."
 denmark_events.132.a: "Terrible."

 denmark_events.133.t: "Armoury Raided"
 denmark_events.133.d: "Today, BOPA has made off with several hundred rifles after launching multiple assaults on armouries across Denmark. Many of these raids failed, but their bait and switch tactics allowed them to divert police and reserve unit attention away from high-profile targets to assault lesser-defended targets with no real opposition. While our overall stockpiles may not feel the weight of this impact, letting hundreds of rifles fall into the hands of these criminals will definitely prove troublesome. Reserve units are currently being redeployed to military depots and armouries across major city centres to try and prevent another attack."
 denmark_events.133.a: "Terrible."

 denmark_events.134.t: "Conflict with BOPA Ends"
 denmark_events.134.d: "With the end of the war and Denmark finally returning to peace, the time has finally come for BOPA and the Danish Freedom Council. Their luck has bottomed out as major army units have returned and a decided effort to finally quash their reign of terror, sabotage, unrest, and raids. BOPA leader Børge Houmann has officially announced an end to activities, and many ringleaders have been arrested or have fled Denmark to meet an unknown fate abroad. Denmark can finally return to peace and prosperity."
 denmark_events.134.a: "All our worries aside, let's return to matters at hand."

 denmark_events.135.t: "Conflict with BOPA Ends"
 denmark_events.135.d: "Marshal Prior has returned with a full report on his efforts to quash BOPA and directly contend with Føderationen's efforts to dismantle the Danish state and overturn its stability. While his pursuits have garnered a greater loss of life and an increase in civil unrest, he has brought BOPA leader Børge Houmann to justice, which has nailed the resistance efforts led by BOPA and the Danish Freedom Council. With their leader arrested, much of the organised resistance has ceased, and Denmark can continue to invest in the war effort without any worry from within. Marshal Prior has returned to full active duty following this and will prove a great asset in organising aid against enemies from east and west."
 denmark_events.135.a: "Though messy, Marshal Prior has been a boon to our cause."

 denmark_events.137.t: "Supporting the Danish Revolution"
 denmark_events.137.d: "Denmark's hasty entrance into our alliance has brought about a question, Denmark's military staff has seen recent retirements due to loyalties to the old regime, thus perhaps we should send a general to help advise their troops. General Louis Buisson has suggested departing for Denmark to provide expertise and to aid in coordinating their military towards our owns. However, some in our staff have noted that beyond troops and rifles, Denmark is in good hands already. What should we do?"
 denmark_events.137.a: "Let General Buisson depart for Denmark."
 denmark_events.137.b: "Denmark has things under control, let's not."

 denmark_events.138.t: "Arrival of an Internationale Advisor"
 denmark_events.138.d: "Armour specialist and Internationale advisor from France, General Louis Buisson, has just arrived in Copenhagen. Alongside several thousand men and what corps could be sent to our cause from across the North Sea, General Buisson has been assigned to oversee and coordinate our military efforts to their own."
 denmark_events.138.a: "Wonderful!"

 denmark_events.141.t: "The Prior Affair"
 denmark_events.141.d: "Nearly a week has passed since Stauning made his bid to secure Denmark's independence and his rule, yet no reply has been received from France. Many in the army, such as Marshal Prior, have expressed concern that should too much time pass, Denmark could be on the receiving end of a German howitzer. Marshal Prior already had concerns about allowing Denmark to fall to socialism but had stayed on board due to the notion that it would be a sort of fusion of systems and that Thorvald Stauning was likely guaranteed an electoral victory, though serving the country was his first and main duty, after all.\n\nThis all changed after Stauning made a public address attempting to soothe the nerves of citizens in Copenhagen, leaving Marshal Prior to receive word that France had outright rejected Stauning's willing compromise on his ideals and would refuse to offer assistance to Denmark in this critical hour. With little time to react and the German army seemingly ready to invade from Nordslesvig into Denmark proper, Marshal Prior took matters into his own hands. He gained the backing of many other loyal generals and performed a coup against the Stauning government while leaking to the press his plans to syndicalise Denmark and turn the country over to the hands of the French.\n\nPublic outrage ensued, and Thorvald Stauning's resignation was all but inevitable, with Marshal Prior appointing Victor Pürschel to lead a new government. He sent a telegram to then-in-exile King Christian X, declaring that the syndicalist revolution had been thwarted and that he could return to take the crown. Not all in Denmark are happy about this new state of affairs, but Denmark has avoided a looming German invasion at the cost of its democracy."
 denmark_events.141.a: "The game was rigged from the start."

 denmark_events.142.t: "Plans for Demilitarisation"
 denmark_events.142.d: "Peter Munch has announced to the cabinet that he will be once again attempting to pass another Disarmament Bill next year. This controversial bill, maintained in our coalition known as the 'Pacifist Accord', is a means championed by Radikale Venstre leader Peter Munch to ensure Danish neutrality. However, with escalations across the world, including unrest in the United States and several other parts of Europe heating up, our neutrality may be called into question once more. Munch has assured the cabinet that should it come to war, Germany will once more assume its rightful role as a European policeman of sorts and allow Denmark to maintain its neutrality.\n\nSuch comments are at the behest of King Christian's desire to remilitarise in accordance with the opposition's view on the matter, but only time will tell if we can get our way this time. The last Disarmament Bill several years ago failed after the Conservatives in the Landsting vetoed it, as they have always done in the face of disarmament."
 denmark_events.142.a: "Our desires for neutrality may come to a head."

 denmark_events.143.t: "The Disarmament Bill of [GetYear]"
 denmark_events.143.d: "The time has come for Peter Munch to once again rally much of the antimilitarists and supported pacifists to push through his aforementioned Disarmament Bill through parliament. However, Peter Munch, instead of presenting the bill to parliament or to the cabinet, has made an emergency address dictating his as a failure to realise the priorities at hand. Much of the antimilitarist wing of Radikale Venstre threatened Peter Munch to step down, but his guiding hand in explaining that with the backing of [GetSecondInCommand], Munch has been convinced that a new Disarmament Bill is not what Denmark needs.\n\nIn a heartfelt speech, Peter Munch thanked his supporters and reinvigorated trust in the government to handle affairs, declaring that, perhaps beyond his time, there would not be a need for an army. Thus, the Disarmament Bill never reached parliament and died as it lived, idealism fuelled by ignorance and lack of self-awareness to the world at hand, much to Munch's chagrin."
 denmark_events.143.a: "One step at a time, Denmark shall be revitalised."

 denmark_events.144.t: "Syndicalism in Denmark"
 denmark_events.144.d: "In a surprise turn of events, the king in Copenhagen has abdicated and Thorvald Stauning has approved a socialist government to take power, and in turn, the country will flip to a syndicalist system of sorts in hybridity with the ideals of Statsraad. While normally mainland affairs hold little value to us, the Danish ambassador to Reykjavik has announced a choice for Iceland. Either we convert to a syndicalist system as well, as an independent member of the Third Internationale, or gain full independence instead and decouple fully from Denmark. The choice is ours to make, and whichever we choose will drastically change the landscape of Iceland to come."
 denmark_events.144.a: "Invite the People's Unity Party to form a government."
 denmark_events.144.b: "Decisively, the Independence Party gains fervour, and we shall decouple fully."

 denmark_events.145.t: "Preparations for the [GetYear] Referendum"
 denmark_events.145.d: "[GetSecondInCommand] has addressed his cabinet today to present what he feels are necessary additions to the constitution, in which a referendum will be held by the people of Denmark in the coming months. [GetSecondInCommand] has proposed that the age to vote should be lowered from 25 to 23 years and has presented plans to replace the upper house of the Rigsdag, the Landsting, with the Rigsting. While this move is largely uncontroversial, many members of KF have lambasted the contents of the plan to replace the Landsting with the Rigsting, which would largely dissolve the majority they've enjoyed carrying for almost a century. As such, leaders of the KF, including Victor Pürschel and Jack Westergaard, have met with the King on a solution to the Danish malaise.\n\nSurely the King wouldn't intervene and use his long overdue powers to dismantle the democracy we have carefully protected? Only time can tell, and the cabinet holds onto this referendum with uncertainty for the future."
 denmark_events.145.a: "This referendum's conclusion may be a critical turning point for the country."

 denmark_events.146.t: "King Christian Meets with [GetSecondInCommand]"
 denmark_events.146.d: "Shortly after King Christian X announced his bid for the government to rally its forces with the Reichspakt and prepare for its entrance should a war break out in the east or the west, King Christian X met with [GetSecondInCommand], putting hefty pressure on the government to comply. King Christian X wields executive reserve powers, which he can use to veto a bill and dismiss any government of his choosing without requiring just cause. However, no monarch in the history of our nation has dared to even use these powers.\n\n[GetSecondInCommand] has come to an impasse, declaring that the government itself shall decide foreign policy and not the king, to which King Christian X left extremely displeased. Following this meeting, the king has made several appointments, to Marshal Prior as well as to conservative leader Victor Pürschel, discussing the possibility of an overthrow with army support. Fortunately, Marshal Prior has decried the king's request, declaring that his wishes would be most undemocratic, and has declared neutrality in the matter. This crisis can and will have destructive consequences for Denmark should its government fail to manoeuvre out of it correctly."
 denmark_events.146.a: "We'll do our best to prepare the country as the king sees fit."
 denmark_events.146.b: "He'll choke on his words once we're through with him."

 denmark_events.147.t: "Rally Turned Violent Shut Down"
 denmark_events.147.d: "While matters concerning this upcoming referendum have largely seen apathy from the Danish people, with the press reporting on limited responses based on their opinion towards the issues at hand, Peter Munch has taken the initiative to publicly declare that Denmark shall absolutely not stray from its path of neutrality. Challenging this rally, Jack Westergaard marched his Konservative Ungdom (Young Conservatives) through the crowd, effectively throwing the rally into disarray following the military's orders to crack down on the rabble-rousers through any means necessary.\n\nIt is hard to tell who fired the first shot, though regardless, nearly a dozen lay dead on either side as the conservatives accuse several soldiers of being responsible for igniting this conflict. This bloody rally and its poor handling by the government have increased discontent, and many are doubting whether or not [GetSecondInCommand] should even continue as Prime Minister."
 denmark_events.147.a: "A terrible tragedy."
 denmark_events.147.b: "Where we're going, people like Westergaard won't be tolerated any longer."

 denmark_events.148.t: "Germany Applies Political Pressure"
 denmark_events.148.d: "If matters surrounding the constitutional crisis weren't already bad enough, the German Ambassador in Copenhagen has levied a series of demands, having expected Denmark to commit to an alliance sooner, considering the state of the world. As preliminaries to full integration into the Reichspakt alliance, the German Ambassador has instructions to demand unrestricted military access to further cement prevention of a sudden Internationale invasion, restriction of straits access to the Internationale, as well as a full trade embargo on both the Internationale and Russia.\n\nThe suddenness of these demands has pushed the ruling government into a difficult position, which could entirely decimate chances for survival should they respond rashly. Making matters worse, King Christian X has met with the German ambassador and discreetly mentioned his support for every single demand, and this has put significant pressure on our governance. At the end of the day, the cabinet's response is..."
 denmark_events.148.a: "...vague but positive, Denmark shall push towards such a goal in due time."
 denmark_events.148.b: "...dismissive and negative, we are not the Kaiser's puppets."

 denmark_events.149.t: "Victory in the Constitutional Crisis"
 denmark_events.149.d: "[DEN_concrisis_win_loc]"
 denmark_events.149.a: "Neutrality aside for now, we have a war to win."
 denmark_events.149.b: "Danish liberalism endures, as it should."
 denmark_events.149.c: "We trust the Germans to be reasonable, hopefully."

 denmark_events.1000.t: "Death of King George V"
 denmark_events.1000.d: "News has reached Copenhagen regarding the recent death of the king of the British exiles in Canada. While such a death may not concern us personally, perhaps we should send a personal message of our condolences, seeing as our king, Christian X, is a cousin of his. However, not many in the current ruling government share the same remorse that the liberals and conservatives do about this tragic loss of life of once emperor over half the planet."
 denmark_events.1000.a: "Let us send a private message at once."
 denmark_events.1000.b: "Don't bother."

 denmark_events.1001.t: "Denmark Sends their Regards"
 denmark_events.1001.d: "Since the death of King George V, we have received word of condolences from [FROM.GetSecondInCommand] and his cabinet on behalf of King Christian X. Matrilineal members of the House of Oldenburg, they were cousins, and while our two states particularly do not share noteworthy customary relations, such words are always welcome on behalf of the royal family. It is enlightening that those across the Atlantic, even a small nation such as Denmark, look fondly upon us in our darkest hour."
 denmark_events.1001.a: "A polite gesture."

 denmark_events.1003.t: "Børge Houmann and Martin Andersen Nexø Sign Totalist Charter"
 denmark_events.1003.d: "After departing for London, members of the Føderationen's Kommunarder branch, namely Børge Houmann and Martin Andersen Nexø, formally signed the Totalist Charter being drafted by Oswald Mosley and other interested parties. Both men studied and were trained in socialist ideas overseas. Nexø, a writer especially famous for his novel Pelle Erobreren, maintains ideals unbefitting of the comfortable Danish democracy, which still endure to this day. The degree to which he fosters the young members of Føderationen has earned him the charming nickname of 'Kommunard Vicevært' or 'Communard Caretaker' amongst those in the party.\n\nBørge Houmann, too, has extreme beliefs about the future of Denmark. He is a younger member of the Føderationen, a part of the next generation of communists that Nexø has been preparing."
 denmark_events.1003.a: "When we see each other again, maybe you'll have a home to return to."

 denmark_events.1005.t: "Arne Sørensen Announces Support for BOPA"
 denmark_events.1005.d: "Surprising news has arrived from the Danish far right, who have thus far been nominally silent about affairs after Denmark has entered the war on Germany's side. With BOPA and the Danish Freedom Council up in arms across the country, DS leader Arne Sørensen has voiced support for their cause and has drawn a large crowd after a speech in Copenhagen declaring that the Danish government has drawn the last straw in regards to alignment with Germany and mobilisation of Danish forces. A long critic of the growing Danish parliamentary system and the way that the government has bent over backwards to suit the demands of King Christian X, Arne Sørensen has gone as far as to declare that side by side with the efforts of BOPA, Dansk Samling will support their cause.\n\nUnrest has risen, both in support of Arne Sørensen's speech as well as against it, though the Danish Freedom Council happily accepted the support from a legitimate party in some prominence. Arne Sørensen and his supporters wield little support in overturning Denmark's commitment to the war effort, but he will be yet another thorn in our side."
 denmark_events.1005.a: "It seems this war has gotten the left and the right in agreement, to our detriment."

 denmark_events.1006.t: "Little Schleicher"
 denmark_events.1006.d: "News from our small ally to the north in Denmark is rarely noteworthy, but a particular letter reached the Chancellor's desk late this afternoon about a regime change for the better in Copenhagen. It seems that KU and now KF leader Jack Westergaard has triumphed over Danish parliamentary democracy and factionalism in his party by passing a law not dissimilar to the Enabling Act passed by Schleicher himself. Although Westergaard governs with all of the bark and none of the bite of a rabid dog, defanged by much of the KF who intend to obstruct his vision, much praise can be allocated towards his successes.\n\nMany in the Foreign Office have affectionately dubbed Westergaard 'Little Schleicher' in reference to the way his work towards cementing his regime has emulated our own policies. Our two nations are now closely aligned and shall forever stand against the syndicalist traitors in our midst, and that fact remains important above all else."
 denmark_events.1006.a: "I have fans abroad now? How cute."

 denmark_events.1007.t: "King Christian X's 70th Birthday"
 denmark_events.1007.d: "Thousands across the nation celebrate and witness as [GetSecondInCommand] meets with King Christian X on the steps of Amalienborg Palace, following the awarding of King Christian X's 70th birthday. Having reigned as the Danish king for 28 years and continuing to do so for the inevitable future, and having guided Denmark through several crises and drastic wars such as the First Weltkrieg, leaves a bittersweet taste in the mouths of many as his push for participation in the next war came at quite the cost. Nevertheless, celebration is in the air of many cities across Denmark, as sales for the Kongemærke, or the King's Mark, broke over 1.5 million in just a month.\n\nThe Kongemærke is both a symbol of the king, having been designed with sterling silver and red enamel, displaying both the letters CX and the Danish national flag. This edition sold at 5 kroner, though a special edition made with 14-carat gold was priced at over a hundred kroner. Festivities and delight aside, the war ongoing is a focus for many, but this event remains a solid morale boost for the troubled nation."
 denmark_events.1007.a: "Happy Birthday Konge Christian!"

 denmark_events.1008.t: "Freden i Wien Overturned"
 denmark_events.1008.d: "It has been nearly a century since Denmark was stripped of land to the south, the Duchy of Slesvig was seized by dual ownership of Prussia and Austria, and Denmark would face the humiliation of such a loss for decades to come. Today has overrode that national disgrace, with the fall of the German Empire and the rise of Danish ownership of what still remains a significant Danish population; celebrations are being held across the country about this reunification of states. While much of what was controlled by us a century ago now holds a significant German population, such as those living farther south in Slesvig-Holstein and Hamburg, many Danes in Nordslesvig are happy to return to their rightful homeland."
 denmark_events.1008.a: "Never shall we be separated again."

 denmark_events.1009.t: "Bornholmerskolen Flourishes"
 denmark_events.1009.d: "The tiny island of Bornholm has received hundreds of guests these past months, all due to the influx of civilians fleeing the ongoing war or the onslaught of war abroad towards neutral Denmark. Our decision to remain neutral came at a cost, but the reward is a flourishing nation that does not have to contend with the death, destruction, and magnitude of conflict. On this small island in the midst of the Baltic Sea contains Bornholmerskolen or the Bornholm School of Painters, established in the late 19th century; it has picked up traction for exhibits by famous artists such as Karl Isakson and Edvard Weie.\n\nThese two painters and several dozen more now reside on the island as artists around the world come to experience the natural beauty of Bornholm, which has inspired hundreds of works of art this past year. Visitors have noted that painters often paint in a distinct classic modernist style, utilising experiments with colour, abstraction, and cubism."
 denmark_events.1009.a: "A true Danish gem."

 denmark_events.1010.t: "Frederik Supports Det Kongelige Kapel"
 denmark_events.1010.d: "Det Kongelige Kapel, or The Royal Danish Orchestra, is one of the oldest orchestras in the world, having performed for King Christian I in the 15th century. Thus, the Royal Danish Orchestra became an important part of Danish culture and life, performing for many kings over the centuries and being the cause for the introduction of many renowned works of composers such as Mozart into the country. Renowned Danish composer Carl Nielsen served as its conductor for many years until his untimely death in 1931, and since then, a renewed sense of funding and interest has been placed by the recently crowned King Frederik IX.\n\nFor over a decade now, Frederik has enjoyed visiting concerts and supporting the orchestra, and at times he has been allowed to conduct in their honour. A special announcement was made this day, however, that King Frederik IX would be conducting a movement from Carl Nielsen's Fourth Symphony, which was greatly influenced by the fighting in the First Weltkrieg, in which Denmark watched on the sidelines. Much of the nation is overjoyed with this extra special performance, and tickets sold out within days of its announcement."

 denmark_events.1011.d: "BOPA, or Borgerlige Partisaner, and the Danmarks Frihedsråd, or Danish Freedom Council, have held a massive rally just outside of Copenhagen, attracting members from across the spectrum for a protest against the ruling government. The police kept the situation from getting violent, but it is clear that unrest against the ruling government, and specifically against the king, is rising these past few years. Tying our country to Germany's economic sphere of Mitteleuropa may have only been the first straw, but the king's indignance towards the maintenance of neutrality is well and clear. Therefore, those across the spectrum have coalesced into a solution should Denmark be forced to fight alongside Germany in war.\n\n[GetSecondInCommand] addressed the Rigsdag this day, declaring that any foreign policy will be handled by the government and not by the king, but this has not done much to soothe protests. These organisations, which have seen clandestine support from the Kommunarder Clique of Føderationen and across the spectrum to the recently founded Dansk Samling, much of the fringes of society are uniting under a common goal, to our demise. While there is little now that they can do to challenge our efforts, it is clear to see that should Denmark find itself at war, there is as much to fear internally as well as externally."

Pan is the Greek god of music, and it is well fitting for the symbolism between this Greek god and her late husband; many onlookers have noted that the face has some semblance of Carl Nielsen's face as well. Fonden til Kunstneriske Formaals Fremme commissioned Ann Marie to design this monument, having written, 'I wanted to take the winged horse, eternal symbol of poetry, and place a musician on its back. He was to sit there between the rushing wings blowing a reed pipe out over Copenhagen.'"

Presenting what has been coined as a soft party-state, with revisions made towards the votership to prioritise the strength of local workers' councils, Larsen has effectively the tools to continue to reign without challenge.\n\nSuch a move has been greatly battled against, especially by Thorvald Stauning who has decried these undemocratic actions, but there is little he can do but shout, even if this proposal is passed. On the other hand, a healthy socialist democracy could endear supporters across the spectrum and aid in Denmark's revitalisation, and much of the plan could be downscaled."

Among these changes include the rebranding of political parties now that the Danish monarchy is history. Most importantly, the Konservative Folkeparti, or KF, has fractured, leading to divides held across the prior notion of increasing power towards the king.\n\nVictor Pürschel has announced the creation of Nye Højre, or New Right, as a breakaway party, deeming reconciliation with the KF impossible. Following this move, KF leader John Christmas Møller has seen reinvigorated support, now uncontested in leadership and able to truly argue for broad support for the new Danish republic. While many in the right disagree with this newfound republicanism, Møller has begun to reach out across the spectrum and called for interparty support for the government.

Since the socialist takeover of Denmark, much of the youth have been poisoned with the idea that under a socialist state, Danish youth will become indoctrinated and will become mere drones of the government. Much of that rhetoric has resulted in several minor incidents, involving Jack Westergaard's fiery speeches and organisation of the Konservative Ungdom as if it were his own paramilitary.\n\nPetersen, with the permission of the Prime Minister-President, has organised a rally to counter this reactionary rhetoric and to also educate these youths on the true goals of the state. Democracy and socialism are not mutually exclusive, and Petersen holds this vested electoralism to a strong degree. While Petersen is a member of the DVSP, and Aksel Larsen has spouted dreams of transforming the DVSP into the guiding mass party atop Føderationen, Petersen has largely thrown his weight behind trusting that Larsen will do what is best for the country."

While this news is not particularly noteworthy besides the surprising loss of German control in the region, ND leader Max Arildskov announced that he would be pledging a state visit to Estonia, and joining with him are Iver de Hemmer Gudme and Richard Gustav Borgelin, both military men in their own right.\n\nMax Arildskov fought the Bolsheviks in Estonia's war for independence just over a decade ago, having joined his father to fight from southern Estonia to the Daugava River. Arildskov, Gudme, and Borgelin would fight in the only volunteer corps to leave Denmark, Compagnie Borgelin. Their desire to celebrate Estonia's newfound independence is not overtly shocking, given the rise of the autocratic leader Artur Sirk within Estonia's government, of which the men hold ideological leanings towards.\n\nArildskov, a right-wing leader who founded Det Nye Danmark in accordance with Savinkov's own party, met with and befriended the Vozhd while fighting in Archangelsk.

Leader of Det Nye Danmark, Max Arildskov, followed by Iver de Hemmer Gudme and Richard Gustav Borgelin, docked in our capital earlier this day, following a journey over the sea. While our country is in little state for tourism, following the Forest Brothers' uprising and proclamation of Estonia as a free country once more, a company of two hundred fought for our independence over a decade ago. These men, alongside others, fought in Compagnie Borgelin, the only Danish company to leave Denmark and fight for Estonia and Latvia in their time of need.\n\nArtur Sirk personally met with these men, many of whom share similar ideological views with the man and declared their support for his regime, as long as he remains in power. Surprisingly, opposition leader Otto Strandman also arranged a meeting, having personally met with them over a decade after their march to Tallinn within a victory parade.

Having earned the rank of rear admiral in the past decade, Frederik serves not only a critical task for caring for our fleet, but is also a popular figurehead amongst the navy. He was instructed by Admiral Vedel when he was a cadet and has seen a close relationship with the Admiral over the past decade. It is customary for the king's duties to come first, and as such for Frederik to retire from the navy; however, Frederik himself has come forward with a proposal.\n\nFrederik has long desired to break the tense distance between the king's position and the people of Denmark, so perhaps managing some role in the navy while also being king would do great in severing that distance. On the other hand, Frederik could retire gracefully from the navy and retain his position of being an influential Konge-Admiral, both inspiring the young naval staff and admirals alike to further develop Denmark's fleet proudly."

He has announced that Socialdemokratiet, as a party must undergo change and modernisation as the world shifts around them; thus, he has unveiled a new programme dedicated to transforming Socialdemokratiet into a true party for the Danish people. This year's party congress for Socialdemokratiet was abuzz with attention as a new committee was founded to review the programme of principles first set in stone in 1913. This committee consists of party members, the trade union movement, and the cooperative, hoping to craft several principles and programs that will both secure Danish democracy and effectively aid in bringing Denmark out of this economic crisis.\n\nStauning declared in a speech that growing revanchism from the east and west—from the International's syndicalist militias to the once dominant Russian hegemon now crushed under the German thumb for decades—will only push for the destruction of harmony in Europe. As such, a Denmark under Stauning and Socialdemokratiet will seek to unite the workers and peasants, as well as the capital and workers.

As expected, Westergaard and his supporters have seized all means of the state and have begun to push ahead with reforms that draw back on the modernisation of the state, withdrawing welfare support and many liberal economic reforms, with the backing of business leaders such as A.P. Møller. However, not all is secure for this quasi-dictatorship, as today John Christmas Møller has made headlines across the country, decrying Westergaard's rule and calling on many to further resist his governance.\n\nUpon hearing of this news, Westergaard immediately rushed to call on the KU to suppress this organisation, but with the Copenhagen revolt fresh in the minds of many, there were few wishing to support drastic action. Westergaardist minister Ole Bjorn Kraft instead instigated a propaganda offensive to oppose Møller, but the damage had been done as several unruly KU members raided a peaceful protest outside Amalienborg Palace. Citing the leagues of violence by this paramilitary group, Møller and leaders from Socialdemokratiet, Venstre, and Radikale Venstre have met to organise a plan of action to save Denmark from within."

Many youths have joined John Christmas Møller's cause in a joint statement with Aksel Møller and have formed Ungdomssamvirket as their own youth group to combat our own. The former youth organisations of several other political parties joined together with Ungdomssamvirket to create a popular youth front for the restoration of democracy, and have begun protests against our rule which has led to many defections amongst our ranks.\n\nCay Lembcke delivered a speech rousing nationalist fervor to try to win back some support, but the damage has been done, and it seems that many do not tolerate our rule since our takeover. They rally to the cause of protecting parliamentarism, sovereignty, democracy, and freedom, asserting that these ideals constitute Danishness. These ideas were mainly advised by theologian Hal Koch, who has played a major role in the movement to resist Westergaardist rule, which appears to be an enduring thorn in our side."

Today, Dansk Samling has been incorporated into a broad Westergaardist wing, while Nye Danmark has been reorganised into a nationalist Savinkovist wing. Democratic opposition only solidified in response to the invitation of known radicals plotting Denmark's parliamentary demise, but their resolve is only in alignment with Westergaard's own. Westergaard gave a speech in Copenhagen declaring that Nye Højre shall be reformed beyond the point of a political party into a front for all Danish people, and shall become one with the state. It will take time for this 'New Right' front to solidify itself over Denmark, but with power all but secured for the near future, it seems as if Westergaard's plans are all coming together."

Today, Jack Westergaard, Victor Pürschel, Ole Bjorn Kraft, and several other high ranking members of Westergaard's clique met to form a brand new party, Nye Højre (New Right). Claiming the legacy of Højre which dissolved in 1915, popularly struggled to regain momentum after the fall of the J.B.S Estrup government at the turn of the century, is now reborn into a brand new party for the right in Denmark. NH's power is cemented in an analogous set of laws which effectively have dissolved the Rigsdag and emboldened power within those few at the top.\n\nA fusion of nationalist rhetoric, the desire to reclaim Danish greatness, and promising an end to liberal modernisation as well as decades of parliamentary reform which dismantled true Danishness, Westergaard and co. sit at the top of this new hierarchy. With a new party to represent the goals and desires of Westergaard's ideals unleashed, the landscape of the Danish right is forever changed."

Characterised by their studies abroad in Britain and France, the Kommunarder Clique is a select faction of older communist figures, including Nexø as well as figures such as Børge Houmann and Alfred Jensen. Their ideals develop around the idea that Denmark should be transformed into a means for the Scandinavian revolution to flourish and that Denmark should transform itself into an outpost for the revolution. Alongside this, the Kommunarder Clique advocates for a centralisation of the state and for the sycophancy of the party to the state to achieve this final solution. Not only will Denmark's workers fight for their own liberation, so too shall they fight to liberate workers across Europe as well. Their views are not shared lightly across the party, and many regard them as Maximalists willing to do whatever it takes to ensure Denmark is converted into a socialist state not too dissimilar to that of France or Britain.§!\n"

The party had initially been led by Marie Sophie-Nielsen as well as Thøger Thøgersen, who broke away from Socialdemokratiet in the wake of the chaos of the tumultuous revolutions across Europe, and is now solely piloted by Larsen, with Thøgersen supporting him heavily. While the party holds in some regard other members who broke from Socialdemokratiet who advocate for republicanism, DVSP has taken on a stance of supporting workers' councils as the primary means for power in the nation. Larsen, though, is not liked by much of Føderationen and has shown signs of wanting to dissolve the party and place the DVSP as the sole mass party for Danish workers and citizens to support.

Christian Christensen, leader of the Fagopposition Samenslutning, and former social democrat, has long led this so-called 'union of unions', wanting to organise trade unions across the country into one big union which would operate and manage the desires and freedoms of workers with great efficiency. Conciliatory and compromising, Christensen and the FS are well liked by most but disliked by Larsen due to his desire for true trade union dominance over the country. On the other hand, young firebrand Richard Jensen emerges, representing the young guard and is held in high regard by those in the navy, especially as he chairs Søfyrbødernes Forbund, the chief union for sailors and seamen. He too came from a poor upbringing, working in the navy, and has represented his desires to elevate seamen for the tough job they perform and for the great disdain for how little attention is placed upon them.

However, it was not until Thorvald Stauning's ascension in 1924, in the wake of Radikale Venstre's failure in government and a caretaker conservative government being appointed, that Socialdemokratiet rose in popularity, also appointing the world's first female minister, Nina Bang. For the past decade, Stauning has alleviated tensions with the left in his desire to create a welfare state, in a coalition with Radikale Venstre, steering the course for Denmark's continued prosperity.

While hardly one of the dominant parties in the 1920s, the KF successfully used its entrenchment in the upper house to block Stauning's more radical policies.

Though this 'red scare' has inspired a resurgence of conservatism in Danish society, the KF is currently far from the levers of power, and even its one-time partner Venstre does not see eye-to-eye with its policy of rearmament 'to take the fight abroad', and so the KF sees itself alone in campaigning against Peter Munch's antimilitarist rhetoric and advocating for the necessary militarisation and investment into the army.§!\n"

Therefore, we must do all that we can in order to express to the people of Denmark that this government is ready and willing to arm the nation for war.\n\nThis does not mean our task will be easy; King Christian X is still watching our every move and can pass a motion to dismiss the government if we handle this situation poorly.

Stauning has opened debate with the cabinet based on these demands, and while they would impede on Danish sovereignty in some part, it would allow Denmark to maintain neutrality, albeit from a 'neutral ally' perspective such as Norway took in the past war. However, there are those in the cabinet that have outright rejected the demands, and as such there is an impasse on the decision. Stauning has the final call to sway either side of the debate; how should we reply?"
 DEN_hard_mil_demand_loc: "first German demand received has been a request for Denmark's outright membership in their military alliance. This comes with complete outrage from much of the party, including coalition leader Peter Munch, declaring that this demand is a call to turn Denmark into nothing more than another Oststaat for the Germans. Much of Socialdemokratiet is in agreement with this consensus, though the alternative of invasion or perhaps striking a deal with the sharks on the other end of the pond doesn't make rejecting the offer any more convincing. However, there are those in the cabinet that believe this demand is a necessity and should be accepted, and as such there is an impasse on the decision. Stauning has the final call to sway either side of the debate; how should we reply?"
 DEN_easy_eco_demand_loc: "second German demand received has been a request for diverting trade towards Germany, and levying a far lower cost on the import and purchasing of Danish goods towards German hands. This agreement would place a small toll on the Danish economy, but would allow Denmark to yet trade with anyone they desire, though much of it throttled towards the German market. Stauning has agreed that these demands would put a bit of a stall on plans towards implementing the greatest extent of the welfare state; however, there are those in the cabinet that have accepted the demands, and as such there is an impasse on the decision.

Such a demand would place a hefty toll on the Danish economy and even call into question how 'neutral' Denmark can even be when a portion of its economy is being leased to Germany. The leasing of factories has also caused an uproar in the cabinet, declaring that this demand subverts Danish independence and forces Denmark into a submissive position to the German government.

This does not come with a sigh of relief, as Denmark watches from the sidelines of what may turn out to be another war across the entire world. Volunteer brigades have been formed from the left and the right, and from the centre, pushing themselves to fight on battlefields across Europe and beyond.\n\nWhile Denmark may have avoided direct alignment with one side or the other, Marshal Prior has cautioned the army to prepare for a scenario in which the Third Internationale exploits their isolation to strike into Germany, but much of the government has rejected overt mobilisation and conscription, citing that it would violate several treaties signed with Germany. For now, all we can do is wait and see whether Europe will fall into turmoil or if Denmark will find itself entrenched between the beasts of the west and east."
 DEN_2wk_start_GER: "[GetSecondInCommand] met with King Christian X after having publicly declared a joint statement for war alongside the German Empire and its allies. Danish troops have been training and mobilising, and the government has done justice in due diligence to prepare the country for war. While Denmark's military prowess may be reduced to either an army for its defence alongside a mobile elite force for use in the German Heer or on the eastern front against the Russian forces, Denmark has made history with its choices to align to fight for the stability of Europe.\n\nHowever, this news has not been received well across Denmark, and many antimilitarists have taken to the streets of major cities in Denmark, especially Copenhagen, to protest the war effort. While they do not present a significant threat, some in our cabinet have expressed worry that insidious groups within the country may take advantage of such sentiment and resist our decision."
 DEN_2wk_start_FRA: "This is Denmark's darkest hour, or perchance one of many in history as Denmark strives to fight against Germany, for the preservation of Danish democracy and the state, though under a newly formed socialist government. Thorvald Stauning has made the biggest risk of his entire career, and what will prove to be a damning pivotal one which will decide whether or not Denmark survives and thrives or plummets to German occupation. Failed negotiations led to this moment, and Stauning's compromise on his democratic ideals to adopt a socialist system has seen great displeasure from his party and much of Venstre, KF, and Radikale Venstre.\n\nHowever, for how bold his actions were, Denmark now finds itself in somewhat of a socialist system, with the backing of troops from France and Britain and a general mobilisation of forces; only time can tell if this gamble was worth the risk."

The Danish military has already begun to mobilise, alongside the readying of the air force and the navy, preparing for a conflict from east to west to determine the fate of Europe and beyond. Stauning's dreams for neutrality may have been dashed, but the continuance of a fair Danish democracy will proceed as desired. From here, Stauning has announced plans to continue the development of the welfare state... and curtail these long unresolved reserved powers the king holds."

He has also addressed that he has uncovered plans of KF collaborating with the king in case of his dismissal as Prime Minister, and the end of the coalition with KF may be on the horizon."

Thorvald Stauning hastily addressed the country, declaring King Christian X a tyrant who was planning his dismissal and the death of Danish democracy in place of an authoritarian one bent on maintaining his power. Already, Stauning has sent a diplomat to Berlin to discuss the terms of the new Danish-German relations, and only time can tell if peace will prevail."
 DEN_marlib_crisis_loc: "Thomas Madsen-Mygdal proposed plans to lower the voting age from 25 to 23 years and has made plans for a series of anti-socialist laws; however, many of them have been cast down by John Christmas Møller. In exchange for rigorous anti-socialist laws as well as continuing the grand liberal economic ambitions that Madsen-Mygdal has been eager to add to his party's programme, Møller has convinced him that a unicameral parliament should be instituted. Despite the dominance of the liberals and conservatives in the upper house, Møller has long clamored for an end to what has been, for decades, a rubber stamp obstructing progress for reform. Unfortunately, their plans have been thwarted by the specter of worldly affairs."
 DEN_socdem_crisis_loc: "Thorvald Stauning proposed plans to lower the voting age from 25 to 23 years and to replace the upper house of the Rigsdag, the Landsting, with the Rigsting. Stauning has received approval for his plans from across the spectrum, with even the chiefly classical liberal-minded Thomas Madsen-Mygdal approving in favour of what has long been a desire for the modernisation of the Rigsdag. Nobody stands in the way of these plans but worldly affairs, which have drawn daggers against these plans ever seeing the light of day for a vote."

 DEN_martin_andersen_nexo: "Martin Andersen Nexø"
 DEN_martin_andersen_nexo_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LJune 26th, 1869, in Copenhagen, Kingdom of Denmark§!\n§YBackground:§! §LBorn to an impoverished and dysfunctional family in the slums of his nation's capital, most of Martin's early life was spent in Nexø, on the island of Bornholm, which the family had moved to when he was eight years old. He was expected to find work and leave home early, toiling as a janitor, cobbler, and mason, until he was able to afford to attend high school in his early 20s. Though drawn to Christian Humanism, Martin also showed sympathies for Socialism and became committed to elevating the voice of the working class as an author. He appended 'Nexø' to the end of his surname, both due to the love of his hometown but also to stand out. During the 1800s, his works saw little purchase outside of the island, and to make things worse, he began to show signs of tuberculosis, which forced him to travel to the Mediterranean to convalesce. There, he saw that the working classes of Italy, Spain, and North Africa were not any different from those of Denmark. Inspired by this commonality, as well as by tales of daring Iberian and Italian revolutionaries, Martin returned to Denmark a committed internationalist and a true socialist. By the turn of the century, he had begun writing his seminal work, 'Pelle the Conqueror', about a young Danish boy who rises to become a labour organiser, while also starting to attend meetings of the Social Democratic Party.\n\nHe wrote often of pessimism and hopelessness as a 'bourgeois disease', but began to personally show doubts over time whether Social Democracy and Reformism were sufficient to elevate the working class. By the late 1910s, the revolutions in Russia and France made him a full-blown Communist. He would later emerge as a Danish delegate to the first meeting of the Third International and for many years as a resident of the French countryside. Even so, he was not a professional politician nor a professional revolutionary; as old age and infirmity wrapped him in their embrace, Martin returned to writing as his principal method for changing the world around him. Though a literary force of nature, the proletarian from Nexø is more renowned as a figurehead due to his connections to Paris and for the political patronage he has offered younger Danish communists, particularly of the radical 'Kommunard' clique.§!"

 DEN_borge_houmann_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LMarch 26th, 1902, in Fredericia, Vejle County, Kingdom of Denmark§!\n§YBackground:§! §LSchooled abroad in England during the Weltkrieg, Houmann returned home and worked at Store Nordiske Telegrafselskab and De danske Statsbaner for several years. Houmann had a devout interest in literature and politics, and often looked to the writings of Kommunard Clique leader Nexø for inspiration. This led to his eventual joining with Føderationen in 1926, having decried that the revolutions ongoing in Britain and France were only the first step, and under their stewardship, Denmark could ascend to that level of freedom from the shackles of reactionarism and capitalism. This fervour, in combination with working alongside Nexø, paved the way for Houmann's rise to a leadership position, at an equivalent rank to the ageing Nexø.\n\nMuch of Houmann's work in the 1930s has alluded to the preparation for what he feels will be an inevitable revolution. As such, he is making contact with and linking the Kommunarder Clique to that of the Internationale, and preparing groundwork for the foundation of movements to resist any push the government makes to undermine Denmark as a whole.§!\n\n§YNotes: Houmann is a prolific writer and editor and has directed many books and pamphlets towards workers and intellectuals alike.§!"

 DEN_christian_christensen_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LJanuary 12th, 1882, in Bandholm, Maribo County, Kingdom of Denmark§!\n§YBackground:§! §LChristensen was born in Bandholm, Lolland, but moved to Copenhagen when he was only five years old. His family stayed within what was known as the rhubarb quarter of the capital; marred by extreme poverty, Christensen's upbringing was characterised by what he felt as a unity amongst the poor. At the age of eighteen, Christensen joined Socialdemokratiet's youth organisation, but soon resigned shortly after. His resignation was due to his alignment with reading on socialist thinkers of the time, such as Marx, but also that of Gersion Trier and Nicolaj L. Petersen. In 1908, Christensen joined the Syndikalist Forbund and became a founding father of the revolutionary trade union movement, Fagoppositionens Sammenslutning. He wrote a book in 1910 titled Arbejderne og Børneflokken, and actively agitated that sexual emancipation and child restraint were essential parts of the struggle of the working class.\n\nDuring the Weltkrieg, Christensen was an editor for the movement's magazine. Towards the war's conclusion, his participation in the Storm on Børsen led to his arrest for a time, but that did not slow down his work. The early 1920s saw the formation of Føderationen, and Christensen was a major joiner, having merged the FS with Larsen's DVSP to form a united party for the left to coalesce under. Into the 1930s, the FS has enjoyed success in recruitment, so much so that the nature of the FS as the superior form to organise the country as a union of unions came under fire, which led to the formation of Enhedspartiet to represent the factions of Denmark from then on. Christensen, as a founding father of the movement, represents the old guard and desires a bureaucratic solution to the problems Denmark faces today.§!"

 DEN_richard_jensen: "Richard Jensen"
 DEN_richard_jensen_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LFebruary 24th, 1894, in Frederiksberg, Frederiksborg County, Kingdom of Denmark§!\n§YBackground:§! §LRichard Jensen came from a poor working-class home; his mother tended to much of the household's duties while his father was often drunk and abusive. Jensen struggled to stay in school, often skipping class, but he gained knowledge living out on the street, as well as the skill and physicality to fight. In the lead-up to the Weltkrieg, Jensen worked as a deck boy and a lighthouse keeper - a job that was endless, work that required a lot out of the sailors of Denmark and for quite little in terms of pay and welfare. Impressed by Christensen's works, as well as having supported the Storm on Børsen in 1920, Jensen joined up with the syndicalists and rose up to the leading role amongst the young guard, declaring he would 'bring fuel to the fire of the world revolution.'\n\nPopular amongst the sailors, Jensen also became chairman of the Søfyrbødernes Forbund, which sought to largely increase wages and decrease working hours for sailors. A strong supporter of an active revolutionary struggle against the capitalist world, Jensen grew popular amongst those disgruntled with participation in the systems at hand, declaring support for its overthrow at any cost.§!\n\n§YNotes: In 1919, Jensen narrowly survived onboard the Korsør train that crashed at Vigerslev Allé.§!"

 DEN_aksel_larsen: "Aksel Larsen"
 DEN_aksel_larsen_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LAugust 5th, 1897, in Odense, Kingdom of Denmark§!\n§YBackground:§! §LBorn into a poor family, Larsen lived from job to job as a child, and, influenced by his family's support for Socialdemokratiet, attended its rallies in his youth. Larsen took part in the violent demonstrations on Grønttorvet in November of 1918 and gradually became more radical in his views. When Socialdemokratiet and De Samvirkende Fagforbund entered a settlement, he resigned from the party and immediately joined the newly founded Left Socialist Party (DVSP), which a year later merged with the FS to form the Kommunistisk Føderation. His popularity was seemingly unknown, as, for the time, popular DVSP founder Marie Sophie-Nielsen stewarded the party from the 1920s, and it was not until her slow retirement that people picked up on the powerful oration of Aksel Larsen.\n\nLarsen visited France and Britain in the late 20s, using his time to study their revolutions - but he was left disappointed and returned to Denmark shortly after. He was dissatisfied with the way that Danes were looking to emulate the French and British model, instead promoting a truly Danish socialism, one with the ideals he gained as a young working-class man. Larsen gained the party leadership of the DVSP shortly after Stauning's ascension as Prime Minister in 1930 and has since promoted both a sense of reunification with the radicals of Socialdemokratiet, but also desires to rally the farmers against the steep crises they faced with ongoing urbanisation.§!"

 DEN_thorvald_stauning: "Thorvald Stauning"
 DEN_thorvald_stauning_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LOctober 26th, 1873, in Copenhagen, Kingdom of Denmark§!\n§YBackground:§! §LThe only child of a family in a working-class household, Thorvald Stauning's mother wanted him to have a good education, and thus his mother got him interested in the growing Danish Labour Movement. He often visited meetings of Socialdemokratiet with his parents as a child, which paved the way for his interest in socialism after reading works by the authors of his time.\n\nThorvald Stauning joined Socialdemokratiet in 1890, at the age of 17, after participating in the May Day protests. Stauning's work in unions developed into his unique ability to negotiate and work with people, and this propelled his rise through the ranks in the following decades. The central leadership recommended his appointment in 1901, but it was not until 1906 that Stauning won a constituency and entered the Rigsdag. Bypassing the syndicalist movements of his time, Stauning utilised his negotiating and orating skills to streamline popularity within Socialdemokratiet, and as leader of the party, fell into coalition alongside Zahle's liberals for much of the Weltkrieg.\n\nOver the course of Zahle's successive governments, Socialdemokratiet had become the stronger party within the coalition, and in 1924, when new elections were held, Stauning's party won them handily. Since then, while having served straight as Prime Minister of Denmark with a small break between 1926 and 1929, Stauning has taken offence with the king's handling of meddling with foreign policy and Munch's clinging desire for the attitude of pacifism.§!\n\n§YNotes: Stauning is not regarded highly in his personal life, with accusations of promiscuity, including outright adultery and alcoholism. While still married to his wife, he has largely escaped punishment due to his political connections with Socialdemokratiet.§!"

Here, he became a student involved with Socialdemokratiet and joined several organisations, including Studentersamfundet and Catilina. In the lead-up to the Weltkrieg, Buhl took his time in law school in order to get a job to become a judge; however, he abandoned this goal in favour of employment by Copenhagen's tax authorities. Here, Buhl was instrumental in working through the legal, political, and economical problems regarding taxation in the city and rose to the role of Tax Director in 1924. Into the 1920s, Buhl worked with CV Bramsnæs to reorganise the workers' cooperative housing association after its collapse, and he became a key figure in the labour movement of the time.\n\nAn official in Socialdemokratiet, and having served studiously with Thorvald Stauning, Buhl is a respected politician focused sorely on finances and has been critical for Denmark to navigate budgeting issues surrounding the construction of the Welfare State as well as concerns based on fiscal policy.

Munch studied dutifully, and seldom did he reserve time for 'amusements' which he felt existed outside of his interests. Afterwards, Munch studied philosophy and became entangled with the works of John Stuart Mill. His work as a historian and philosopher led to a love of studying Denmark's national liberal period, which was half a century from the 1840s to the 1880s.\n\nAt the turn of the century, Munch was finally finding his footing ideologically, as a student he carried right-wing views which were attributed not to social or political means, but in having a strong sense of Danish nationalism. Instead, he was entranced by the famed social liberal, Viggo Hørup, and abandoned his nationalist views in favour of the defence and reform policies advocated by the left wing.\n\nHe followed the stringent belief that 'developing Denmark into a superior culture and community would overtake the militaristic culture of the invading nation, to preserve the Dane's national life until the state could gain its independence.' Munch was a member of Zahle's Cabinet over the course of the Weltkrieg. He worked through the 1920s to reform Radikale Venstre and entered into a coalition with Thorvald Stauning, working towards moderate social reform and a shared lowered defence policy. Munch perceived that Germany would forever serve as Europe's policeman in the years following their victory and gave many vibrant speeches discussing disarmament and ensuring that another Weltkrieg could never happen.\n\nThe years that followed into the 1930s were met with bitter resistance towards demilitarisation; several bills passed through parliament would be quelled in the upper house, and Munch became increasingly frustrated. Stauning had read the writing on the walls and had begun a bid of partial increases towards the budget, which enraged Munch, leading to the establishment of the 'Pacifist Accord' which remains as a tenuous agreement upon the state.§!\n\n§YNotes: Devout advocate for strict neutrality, Munch lives by the Viggo Hørup quote 'Hvad skal det nytte?' or 'What's the use of it all?' referring to the armed forces in Denmark.§!"

He subsequently assumed the role of instructor at Dalum Agricultural School and subsequently served as principal from 1908 to 1920. In a manner similar to his father, Madsen-Mygdal joined the Radikale Venstre party at the outset of the First World War, requesting that he be appointed Minister of Agriculture. However, Prime Minister Zahle rejected this request, and in part due to disagreement with the government's regulatory policy, Madsen-Mygdal subsequently left the party. His desire for pure liberalism within Denmark, alongside the enshrinement of agriculture as Denmark's main industry, propelled his popularity within Venstre, the leading liberal party of the time. Madsen-Mygdal was concerned about the influence of state intervention in the economy and largely advocated for the market to stay as free as possible, decrying trade unions to be abhorrent.\n\nIn 1924, after the defeat of Niels Neergard's right-wing coalition comprising Venstre and KF, Madsen-Mygdal was approved as the official leader of the opposition. Under his stewardship, Venstre approved several trade deals with Germany and paved the way for several agricultural reforms. When Thorvald Stauning's government failed to pass a budget for 1927, snap elections were called in December of 1926, after which Madsen-Mygdal formed a government for the first time, though only for a single term. His term was marred by great resentment from the working class as Madsen-Mygdal sought to empower the Danish Krone by reducing wages and easing up on social costs.\n\nIn 1930, Madsen-Mygdal lost the bid for a second term after a disagreement with the brand new KF leader, John Christmas Møller, who found the subordination of the conservatives to Venstre detestable and vetoed the passing of a new Finance Act. Despite leading from the opposition into the 1930s, Madsen-Mygdal is a pragmatic man willing to support the rural population and address their needs despite the growing labour movement, which has since trounced a lot of his popular support.§!\n\n§YNotes: Madsen-Mygdal popularly said, 'Let fall what cannot stand' in regards to the free market, which sums up his classically liberal attitude.§!"

During the Weltkrieg, with support by his mentoring upperclassman Aage Kidde, Møller founded the Konservative Ungdom and chaired it on two separate occasions. His work for the KU propelled Møller to candidacies for several constituencies, and eventually was elected. Møller rose through the ranks of the mainstay Konservative Folkeparti, eventually replacing Victor Pürschel as KF's parliamentary leader. Following the king's condemnation of the British Revolution in his New Year's Speech in 1926, the conservatives split into two factions, a portion following Victor Pürschel under desires to empower the king, while the remainder stayed loyal to Møller.\n\nPopularity for the KF was weakened over the course of the 1920's, and the party was forced into a coalition with Thomas Madsen-Mygdal, who held little regard for the KF's goals.

While he was at school, Pürschel took an interest in student union politics and eventually became entranced with the ideals of the Højre and, after decades of service to the party, saw himself in a leading position within its successor, the Konservative Folkeparti. When the King broke his silence and publicly condemned the actions of the British revolutionaries in his New Year's Speech in 1926, Pürschel urged support for the King's words and hoped that the King would dismiss Stauning's radical left-wing government. This view was at odds with that of parliamentarist wing leader John Christmas Møller, which created a rift in the party. Pürschel's beliefs stand across restoring the dominance of Højre, which had fallen during the Weltkrieg, and to resist political pressure across the spectrum towards reform. As such, Pürschel has garnered attention across the unpopular right and has rallied support from those who agree that the king's authority must be upheld.\n\nKing Christian X has taken an interest in the party and has often been seen in talks with yet another dismissal crisis should the current government fall, that of which would lead to Pürschel's appointment and consolidation of power. Pürschel desires, as many do, to recreate the hegemony of the right and to dismantle democracy in favour of a government agreeable to the king, in which his powers will be upheld and increased in some circumstances, though the constitutional monarchy will largely remain intact.§!"

His reading of several cultural and philosophical books lead to Sørensen despising social conservatism and socialist and radical movements which were blind to traditional values.

In the years following the war, he remained a constant presence during the country's recovery. However, the rise of the British Revolution and the spread of left-wing politics left him highly critical of such movements, to the point where he publicly denounced them in his widely broadcast New Year's Speech in 1926. Many believed he might dissolve the then ruling Social Democratic cabinet, triggering what is referred to as 'Nytårskrisen', or the New Year's Crisis, but he ultimately refrained from doing so.\n\nFirmly aligned with Denmark's conservative elements, Christian supports a military buildup to protect Danish sovereignty against the rising tide of socialism.

In combination with German theorist Max Planck, Bohr developed an atomic model in which he proposed that the energy levels of the electrons are separated and that the electrons rotate in stable orbits around the atomic nucleus , but can jump from one energy level (or orbit) to another.\n\nIn 1920, Bohr founded the University of Copenhagen's Institute for Theoretical Physics, but most who studied there called it the Niels Bohr Institute. This institute allowed Bohr to carry out his dreams of an international cooperation in science. In 1922, Niels Bohr received the Nobel Prize in Physics in recognition of his pioneering work. Many famous physicians visited the institute including Erwin Schrödinger and Werner Heisenberg, the latter of which served as Bohr's assistant for a time.§!"

The Weltkrieg marked Thørgensen's exit from the party due to conflict over the party's support for military grants. Thøgersen soon joined up with Christensen's FS, a growing syndicalist movement, and gained prominence as an agitator and public speaker. Thøgersen participated in the storm on the Børsen exchange in 1918 where he wound up arrested for 4 weeks. Alongside Marie Sophie-Nielsen, Thøgersen helped to found the Danish Socialist Worker's party which later merged into the DVSP.\n\nParty chairman shortly before Aksel Larsen's rise in the late 1920's, Thøgersen remains a vivid agitator and loyal member of DVSP, often the instigator of conflict and factionalism throughout Føderationen.

A strike agitator at Holmen, Larsen rose through the ranks utilising his organisational skills, noted for his discipline and accurate planning. A member of DVSP's central committee and Føderationen's head of intelligence, Larsen is both a critical and effective informant within the left who has organised several workers' actions through the unrest of the 1920's. His guidance assisted in keeping Føderationen together after the New Year's crisis of 1926 and subsequent distrust and suppression of their organisation.

He gained significant language skills while living in England and later participated in the 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm. Returning to Denmark in 1913, Hellberg was a member of the Socialdemokratiet Ungdom (Young Social Democrats) throughout the Weltkrieg and became one of its leading members. During the closing years of the Weltkrieg, strife accumulated in the party's coalition which ultimately affected the SDU, nearly causing its collapse. Hellberg rallied to Socialdemokratiet's radicals including figurehead leader Frederik Borgbjerg, and formed RSDU (Radikale Socialdemokratiet Ungdom) as a separate organisation within the party. Should a crisis have arisen, Hellberg would have thrown his lot with the revolutionaries, but the king did not act after the New Year's Crisis of 1926, and so his position within the party remained stable.\n\nIn the years to come, Hellberg became a protégé of the ailing Radikale-Socialdemokratiet figurehead Borgbjerg, and has taken the reins due to complications with his health. Hellberg remains both an equally influential and divisive figure within Socialdemokratiet, and is a staunch supporter of a democratic socialist system within Denmark.§!"

In the leadup to the Weltkrieg, With served as adjutant to the general inspector of the infantry, and became head of the intelligence section of the general staff. An emboldened nationalist, his promotions to Colonel in 1924 and then to Lieutenant General in 1931 came with severe risks, as he was a strongly anti-German. However, as the world settled around looming domination by the Kaiserreich, With found himself entrenched in the idea that Germany's victory in the Weltkrieg has also cemented their seemingly dominant control over Nordslesvig.\n\nMuch of the agitation around the issue fell upon the extremes, and With heralded himself as a force of the centre, boldly drafting plans for Denmark's defence should the hostile revolutions of the west fall upon Denmark.
