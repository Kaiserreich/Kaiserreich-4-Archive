### Ideas ###
 NIR_no_surrender: "No Surrender!"
 NIR_no_surrender_desc: "Willing to fight and die for their freedom, their king, and their country, the loyalists of Ulster show an unwavering ferocity that is unmatched by most, save for their most ardent Irish rivals. Although small in number, this unbreakable spirit may be enough to turn the tide of any war in their side's favour."
 NIR_catholics: "Ulster Catholics"
 NIR_catholics_desc: "While Northern Ireland may bill itself as a \"Protestant State for Protestant People\", it is still home to an extremely large minority of Catholics who oppose their inclusion in such a state. This feeling is mutual as far as Northern Ireland's government is concerned, and thus they have taken great measures to ensure discrimination against Catholics in all walks of life, oftentimes defining who actually is a Catholic with a very broad brush."
 NIR_canadian_advisors: "Canadian Advisors"
 NIR_canadian_advisors_desc: "In an effort to aid Northern Ireland in their revolt against the Irish government, Canada has sent a team of military advisors to help reshape the rebels into a proper fighting force, rather than a collection of ragtag volunteers."
 NIR_blightys_shores_idea: "To the Shores of Blighty"
 NIR_blightys_shores_idea_desc: "While small in number, the loyalists of Ulster are some of the most committed subjects of the British crown and will fight to see its restoration, or die trying."
 NIR_iedc_aid_idea: "IEDC Aid"
 NIR_iedc_aid_idea_desc: "While some loyalists may refer to Ulster as Ireland's \"Prosperity Province\", few are too prideful to refuse to admit that Northern Ireland can hardly stand on its own economically. To address this, the government of Northern Ireland has requested help from the Entente's IEDC organisation in providing economic an d development aid where needed in the province."
 NIR_executive_committee_idea: "Executive Committee of Northern Ireland"
 NIR_executive_committee_idea_desc: "The devolved administration of Northern Ireland, first established following partition, has been restored to the province. While the powers granted to the province are those often reserved for Dominions of the Crown rather than direct parts of the United Kingdom, few in government regard its present status as anything but an integral part of the nation."
 NIR_royal_ulster_rifles_idea: "Royal Ulster Rifles"
 NIR_royal_ulster_rifles_idea_desc: "Having originally been established in 1881 as one of the eight Irish raised regiments of the British army, the Royal Ulster Rifles have been re-commissioned by the government of Northern Ireland to fight once more for the crown and the Union they hold dear."
 NIR_quartering_idea: "Quartering the King's Men"
 NIR_quartering_idea_desc: "With Northern Ireland's strategically important position to the Entente's armed forces, provisions have been put in place to allow the region to properly facilitate and quarter allied troops when necessary."

 ### Events ###

 northernireland.1.t: "The Future of Northern Ireland"
 northernireland.1.d: "While much of the focus of the newly restored rightful government is of course upon the future of Britain itself, one must not forget that the nation extends across the Irish sea to its loyal subjects in Ulster. A delegation led by [NIR.GetLeader] himself recently visited [GBR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to not only congratulate the government upon its restoration, but also to request input on what the future shall hold for Northern Ireland's place in the Union and how their own provisional government can begin moving towards that future.\n\nAt present there are two primary suggestions regarding the future organisation of Northern Ireland within the nation, with the first of these being a return to a similar devolved status as the province previously enjoyed for a brief period following the Partition. Under these plans the province will continue to remain part of the United Kingdom, but it will be granted a privileged status not too dissimilar to that of a dominion with its own government and prime minister to handle its own political affairs.\n\nThe alternative proposal, one which the provisional government seems to favour, is the return once more to a fully integrated Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom. Instead of being granted any form of devolved self-governance as it held previously, Northern Ireland would be treated almost no differently than Lancashire or Kent. To the fervorous loyalists this is seen as the only way to ensure that they are never separated again from the nation they hold dear. Ultimately however, the choice between these options is one for Britain to now make."
 northernireland.1.a: "Full integration should be pursued."
 northernireland.1.b: "A devolved administration would be more preferable."

 northernireland.2.t: "Choosing a Secretary for Northern Ireland"
 northernireland.2.d: "As part of the efforts to fully integrate Northern Ireland into the Union once more, the provisional government has looked to Scotland's historical place within the nation as an example to follow. As a result they have petitioned for the appointment of a Secretary of Northern Ireland to help properly manage the many affairs of the province, much akin to the role of the Secretary of Scotland and even somewhat to the position held historically by the Chief Secretary for Ireland. While ultimately the exact person in this role is likely to have little impact upon the wider nation, the creation of the role will primarily be an excellent symbolic gesture to show that the people of Northern Ireland are valued members of the Union.\n\nAfter consultation on the matter with the provisional government and relevant ministers, three choices for who to appoint to the position have become apparent. Chief among these is James Hamilton, Duke of Abercorn, who previously served as the Governor of Northern Ireland before the revolution and so may be fitting to reappoint to this similar role. William Leveson-Gower, the Earl Granville, is also seen as a potentially popular choice, having made somewhat of an impressive name for himself for his excellent work during the period of exile. Finally there is Maxwell Ward, Viscount Bangor, an Ulsterman with support from those who wish to see this position held by one of their own. The final decision is now on [GBR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to make."
 northernireland.2.a: "The Duke of Abercorn is an excellent choice."
 northernireland.2.b: "The Earl Granville seems most suited for the job."
 northernireland.2.c: "Ward's an Ulsterman and a Viscount, who could be a better fit for the position?"

 northernireland.3.t: "Northern Ireland Constitution Act"
 northernireland.3.d: "\"It is hereby declared that Northern Ireland remains part of His Majesty's dominions and of the United Kingdom, and it is hereby affirmed that in no event will Northern Ireland or any part of it cease to be part of His Majesty's dominions and of the United Kingdom...\"\n\nWith the period of preparation for full integration having now concluded, the Northern Ireland Constitution Act has today received royal assent. As laid out by this act, the temporary provisional government of Northern Ireland has been dissolved, with many of their former duties now falling under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Office. Loyalist celebrations have already begun across much of Northern Ireland, excluding of course the still primarily Catholic parts of the province, with the highlight of those in Belfast being the speech held by Basil Brooke who declared to the large crowds that \"The Union has been restored, and it shall never again be broken no matter the force against it.\""
 northernireland.3.a: "Quis separabit?"

 northernireland.4.t: "Arms Shipment from the Exiles"
 northernireland.4.d: "This event should never fire for a player. If you see this, report it as a bug."
 northernireland.4.a: "Understood."

 northernireland.5.t: "Canadian Military Mission Arrives"
 northernireland.5.d: "This event should never fire for a player. If you see this, report it as a bug."
 northernireland.5.a: "Understood."

 northernireland.1690.t: "The Northern Rising"
 northernireland.1690.d.mid: "As part of a takeover ironically reminiscent of the Easter Rising, the UVF have seized buildings across the six counties of Northern Ireland, most notably at Belfast City Hall where, in imitation of the Ulster Covenant of 1912, they have signed a document proclaiming independence from Dublin."
 northernireland.1690.d1: "Ever since Aontas Náisiúnta first rose to power, tensions have been brewing between the [IRE.GetAdjective] government and the country's primarily Protestant loyalist population. Now with reports coming in from [119.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], it is clear that these tensions have finally boiled over into full blown revolt against [IRE.GetAdjective] rule.\n$northernireland.1690.d.mid$ Although yet to receive any official support from the British Exiles, their intentions to return to the Crown seem clear, provided their revolt is not crushed by [113.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]."
 northernireland.1690.d2: "Ever since the socialist seizure of power in Ireland, tensions have been brewing between the [IRE.GetAdjective] government and the country's primarily Protestant loyalist population. Now with reports coming in from [119.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], it is clear that these tensions have finally boiled over into full blown revolt against [IRE.GetAdjective] rule.\n$northernireland.1690.d.mid$ With the Entente's war against the Internationale waging on, Northern Ireland seems set to become the frontline for the Exile's attempted Homecoming, provided their revolt is not quickly crushed by socialist forces."
 northernireland.1690.a: "Would they prefer to die at the hands of syndicalists?"
 northernireland.1690.b: "Brave, if foolish."
 northernireland.1690.c: "The last gasp of a dying empire."
 northernireland.1690.e: "Brave sons of Ulster, all."
 northernireland.1690.f: "Will Ireland ever be a nation at peace?"
