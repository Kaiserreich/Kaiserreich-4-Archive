 SZC_totalist_party: "CSP-RHS"
 SZC_totalist_party_long: "Chinese Syndicalist Party - Red Heart Society (Zhongguo Gongtuandang - Chixinshe)\n§LA political force that has seen its popularity surge in recent years, the more active and radical faction of the Sichuanese CSP rallies around one of the province's major labour organisers, Yang Angong.\n\nWorking in league with Wu Yuzhang and the other members of the provincial CSP, Yang and his colleagues would be responsible for organising strikes and uprisings throughout the mid-1920s. Politically, though, Yang would really come into his own as the head of the \"Red Heart Society\", one of the many underground labour organisations in Chongqing, where the working class was concentrated not in the fields, but in the port's many shipyards, docks and silk farms. Vigorous, vanguardist and not averse to militant action, Yang's radicals do not have much faith in the democratic process, as the warlord era has only proven how self-interested and corruptible the democratic and existing civilian institutions across warlord China are.\n\nUnlike other CSP provincial branches, which have split from each other into distinct factions of radicals and moderates, the Sichuanese CSP does not seem to have suffered the same fate, perhaps owing to the province's particularly dire straits fostering more ideological unity than elsewhere, or simply because of Wu Yuzhang's own ability to compromise with and stabilise the leftist front in the province§!\n"
 SZC_syndicalist_party: "CSP-O"
 SZC_syndicalist_party_long: "Chinese Syndicalist Party - Orthodox (Zhongguo Gongtuandang - Zhengtong Pai)\n§LSlightly deviating from the more urban, industrial and union-based syndicalism of the CSP mainstream, the CSP in Sichuan primarily springs from the group of Sichuanese intelligentsia that went abroad to France for work-study programs in the Great War, led by Wu Yuzhang among others.\n\nConnected with the various Sino-French education initiatives and spending time in France during both the war as well as the ensuing revolution, Wu Yuzhang and his fellow intellectuals would arrive back in China to capitalise on the waves of revolutionary fervour that followed the end of the Weltkrieg. Inspired by socialist thought but disheartened by the lack of unity within the Chinese revolution, which had fractured into revolutionary and reformist camps, Wu would spend the 1920s reading the works of socialist thinkers like John Reed, concluding the need for a clear ideological agenda, one which he found within the CSP. This agenda would be expanded with Wu's manifesto of the Sichuan Autonomous Federation, advocating for not only a transformation of the social economy and mutual assistance programs for workers, but an end to \"social parasitism\" and an overhaul of China's outdated education system.\n\nUnlike other CSP provincial branches, which have split from each other into distinct factions of radicals and moderates, the Sichuanese CSP does not seem to have suffered the same fate, perhaps owing to the province's particularly dire straits fostering more ideological unity than elsewhere, or simply because of Wu Yuzhang's own ability to compromise with and stabilise the leftist front in the province.§!\n"
 SZC_radical_socialist_party: "East Sichuan Red Army"
 SZC_radical_socialist_party_long: "Eastern Sichuan Red Army Guerrilla Force (Chuandong Hongjun Youjidui)\n§LThroughout the warlord era, Sichuan, much like its Southern neighbours, has been a hotbed for socialist guerrillas and intellectual activity, though this has been counterbalanced heavily by militarist repression and gentry influence. A keystone in China's agricultural heartland, Sichuan's agrarian nature has resulted in the Red Basin providing a fertile base of support that is sympathetic to the socialist cause.\n\nDuring the Northern Expedition, many members from both the LKMT and the CSP, some of whom had trained as junior officers at Whampoa, conducted irregular activities to disrupt the movements of warlord forces. One of the main actions was the failed Lushun uprising led by Liu Bocheng, Zhu De and Yang Angong in late 1926, which aimed to revolt in tandem with a renewed NRA push and disrupt warlord supply in the Sichuanese backwater. Though unsuccessful, the Lushun uprising would fan the revolutionary flames of the peasantry, refine the strategy of future guerrilla warfare and inspire others like Li Jiajun and Wang Weizhou to also conduct armed resistance in the countryside, resulting in the surprisingly successful Gujunba uprising in 1929.\n\nThe tumults of the 1930s have seen the peasant insurgencies primarily in Eastern Sichuan slowly being pushed back as consolidating militarists like Liao Zhen aim to wipe them out wholesale. Despite this, resistance has been resolute, with many more guerrilla cells mobilising to take the place of the fallen. These militias and revolutionaries have been reorganised in recent years into the East Sichuan Red Army Guerrilla Force, led by a committee headed by Wang Weizhou and split into three route armies, its strength bolstered by more irregular formations like the Fuling Peasant Army and CSP insurgent cells. But for all these developments, it remains to be seen if the last holdouts of both the KMT's agrarian bloc and the CSP in Sichuan have what it takes to wrestle control of the divided province when the time comes.§!\n"
 SZC_social_democrat_party: "Nine Man Regiment"
 SZC_social_democrat_party_long: "Nine Man Regiment (Jiu Ren Tuan)\n§LHolding a record of resistance against the Beiyang status quo and influences from both North and South, Xiong Kewu would make a name for himself in Sichuan in the province's chaotic early years, first against Yuan Shikai and several times after against the various Sichuanese autocrats. He and his \"Nine Man Regiment\", associates of Xiong who studied with him at Tokyo Dongbin Academy, would go on to join the political struggle in Sichuan, with Xiong holding the post of governor sporadically throughout the 1920s, notable for his belief in provincial self-governance and federal autonomy. But among the group's erstwhile warlord \"allies\", their ideological niches would drive a wedge between them and any potential militarists they tried to unite Sichuan with, notably being betrayed by Liu Cunhou, Liu Xiang and Liu Chengxun before being routed entirely by a warlord coalition in late 1923.\n\nAfter his expulsion from Sichuan, Xiong and his allies would take on some even heavier sympathies to federalism in Hunan, building off the abortive attempts at constitutionalism and regional autonomy pioneered in Sichuan. It would be Xiong's federalist tendencies that precipitated his official fallout with the KMT during 1924 and his detention of both him and Yu Jitang at Humen Fortress. But with the commencement of the Northern Expedition and the redirection of Chiang Kai-shek's attention to the front, Xiong would be quietly pardoned by Hu Hanmin, being sent across to Sichuan to rally the remnants of his army.\n\nFollowing the defeat of the KMT, Xiong's Nine Man Regiment would find themselves once again under attack, quickly being pushed out of Southeastern Sichuan and temporarily setting up camp in Hunan before reaching an agreement with Hunan governor Zhao Hengti to be stationed around the town of Tongren. It would be here where Xiong continues to plot his return, refine his plans and recruit new officers to his cause.§!\n"
 SZC_social_liberal_party: "Officer Department"
 SZC_social_liberal_party_long: "$SZC_social_liberal_party_long_tt$\n§LUnlike the other departments, which all derive their namesake from key military academies, the Officer Department would develop from the graduates of the fourth and fifth classes of the Sichuan Preliminary Army School that had also been created under the Qing administration. These officers would become a key component under Baoding leadership, with both Li Jiayu and Luo Zezhou commanding their forces under Deng Xihou until their split with him in late 1929.\n\nIn 1927, Li and Luo would be stationed as divisional commanders around Suining, opting to form the Qunyi Society, a loose organisation aiming to attract new graduates from the Sichuan Army Officer School. The collapse of the Sichuan Frontier Defence Army and the forced resignation of its commander Liu Chengxun during the Central Sichuan War also brought one of his subordinates, Lai Xinhui, into the Officer Department, bolstering their numbers.\n\nHesitant to throw their lot in with any one of their significantly stronger opponents, the Officers have largely succeeded in staying neutral to both the Liu brothers as well as the Zhili provincial leaders throughout the early 1930s. Uniquely, however, the lower-ranking commanders of this department are remarkably progressive, with these ideals even championed by Li Jiayu himself, allowing for the Officer Department to be receptive to elements of federalism, democracy and even some aspects of the KMT.§!\n"
 SZC_market_liberal_party: "Industrial Corps"
 SZC_market_liberal_party_long: "Industrial Corps (Shiye Tuan)\n§LWith their foundation in the non-military sector, the Industrial Corps would primarily be comprised of graduates from the Sichuan Higher Education Academy, aligned with the centre and right of the KMT. Possessing no real central leader owing to the group's hybrid civilian and military wings, the Industrial Corps would begin as subordinates in Xiong Kewu's campaigns against Yuan Shikai and other warlords in the late 1910s. Though initially allied, Xiong's dissatisfaction with Sun Yat-sen's appointment of Yang Shukan as Sichuanese governor in 1918 as well as the removal of Industrial Corps figures from the army by Xiong would result in the Industrial Corps taking their chance during the Yunnanese invasion of 1920 to rebel against him, resulting in the corps' expulsion from the province.\n\nIndustrial Corps activity in Sichuan would not pick up again until Lü Chao's return to the province in June 1923 under orders by Sun Yat-sen. After playing the provincial strongmen of Liu Xiang, Yang Sen and even Yuan Zuming against each other, Lü Chao would find himself with a small defence zone and army, attempting to rally his subordinates to the KMT cause prior to the abortive Northern Expedition. After the collapse of the Guangzhou government, Lü found himself isolated once more, trapped along the Yunnan-Sichuan border and with hostile external forces waiting for an opportune moment to pounce.\n\nThis chance would arise as the 1930s dawned and encirclement campaigns into the mountains began. Hemmed in by Liu Wenhui's men to the West, Pan Wenhua's Southern Bandit Suppression Command to the North and East as well as Long Yun's Zhaotong Defence Commission to the South, Lü Chao had no choice but to melt further into the countryside, where his battered force try to make contact with the main RKMT junta in Guizhou. Even though they are considered a spent force for now, any form of catastrophic instability could prove to be the second wind Lü so desperately needs.§!\n"
 SZC_social_conservative_party: "Baoding Department"
 SZC_social_conservative_party_long: "$SZC_social_conservative_party_long_tt$\n§LOne of the few military factions that do not have roots in Sichuan, the Baoding Department is ostensibly a triumvirate of regional warlords who have graduated and served together from the prestigious Baoding Army Academy. The three leaders of the Baoding Department, Liu Wenhui, Deng Xihou and Tian Songyao, all saw their rise to prominence as key players in Sichuan politics while in an alliance against Yang Sen in 1925, forming the Three Army Command Office in Chengdu the following year.\n\nNestling themselves into the \"Garrison Area\" system that has been pervasive within the province, the Baoding Department would try to work with whoever fortune seemed to favour following the defeat of the Northern Expedition, collectively controlling large swathes of Sichuan's North and West. Both connected with the local gentry and willing to lend an ear to the province's budding intellectuals, they have tried to entrench themselves in provincial politics.\n\nDespite this, the increased consolidation of the Baoding armies under its leadership, as well as the checkered track record regarding military and civic matters has caused fractures in the department, most prominently shown with the rebellion of the Officer Department at the beginning of the Central Sichuan War in late 1929. Even within the upper echelons of this clique, Liu, Deng and Tian occasionally differ on issues of governance and allegiance, though major clashes have generally been avoided due to the uniting presence of the Three Army Joint Office, now stationed in Ya'an under the auspices of general Xiang Chuanyi.\n\nTypically more pragmatic, if the province were to descend back into total war like it has done so frequently in the past, the support of the Baoding Department may be a crucial factor in determining the winner, even if they were to take the crown for themselves.§!\n"
 SZC_authoritarian_democrat_party: "Accelerated Department"
 SZC_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Accelerated Department (Sucheng Xi)\n§LThe nucleus of the Accelerated Department would be trained in the Sichuan Army \"Bianmu\" Corps and the Sichuan Accelerated Army Academy established by governors Xiliang and Zhao Erxun in 1909, with generals rising through the ranks to provincial prominence following the Xinhai Revolution. After the breakdown of central authority in Sichuan, the Accelerated Department grew its power base through two key power players in Sichuanese politics, Yang Sen and Liu Xiang.\n\nYang Sen and his clique would rise through the ranks of various other armies throughout Sichuan in the early 1920s, eventually growing powerful enough to stake their own claim in Sichuan's warlord melee, though they faced setbacks in maintaining their holdings as Yang's power fluctuated. Yang's faction of the Accelerated Department also hold close ties to Wu Peifu and the Zhili clique, with Yang being allowed to build up strength in Western Hubei with permission from the Jade Marshal, aiding him in his return during the failed Sichuan Unification Wars of 1924 and in Yang's triumphant return to the province in 1926.\n\nRivalling his peer, Liu Xiang would become one of the main figures in the expulsion of Yunnanese control from Sichuan throughout the warlord era, utilising his political tact to pit his enemies against each other and rise in the process. Commanding one of the province's most formidable armies and controlling Chongqing, Liu has leveraged his control of the Yangtze River, relations with his uncle Liu Wenhui as well as treaties with the League Marshal Sun Chuanfang to rise as one of Governor Yang's greatest potential challengers.\n\nDue to the fluid nature of Sichuanese politics, Yang and Liu have worked together on many occasions, signing the 1926 Bingyin Convention as well as another truce following the Central Sichuan War. However, over the past few years, tensions have reignited in the Accelerated Department, and the old saying has never rung truer: Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer.§!\n"
 SZC_paternal_autocrat_party: "Armament Department"
 SZC_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "Armament Department (Wubei xi)\n§LOriginating from the late Qing Sichuanese rearmament movement, the Armament Department remains the oldest of the cliques within Sichuan, comprised of predominantly senior military figures who graduated from the Sichuan Armament Academy established in 1902. Upon the takeover of the inland province by Hu Jingyi and Yin Changheng in 1911, the Armament Department influence would only increase, with all echelons of Sichuan command being staffed with Armament graduates and alumni. During the reign of Yuan Shikai, the Armament Department would split into Hu Jingyi's loyalist faction and Liu Cunhou's Sichuanese National Protection Army. However, with Hu being moved to Beijing, and his successor Chen Huan declaring the province's independence, the new de jure governor Luo Peijin held little sway in provincial affairs, resulting in his ousting by Liu Cunhou.\n\nLiu remained at the head of the Armament Department through the intervening years, leading campaigns against extra-provincial forces from Yunnan and Guizhou, Xiong Kewu's army and bandits, while also taking various sides in Sichuan's decades of militarist squabbles, being swept in and out of power all throughout. He would ultimately be appointed by the Zhili as head of the Sichuan-Shaanxi Border Defence Supervisory Office in 1924, obtaining jurisdiction in Sichuan's North-east.\n\n\"The Thick-faced General\" (as he would come to be known due to his stubborn, resilient nature) would spend most of the late 20s and early 30s cooperating with local gentry, aligning with other regionalists and building a new Armament Officer Corps with the likes of Liao Zhen and Liu Bangjun. Simultaneously, Liu Cunhou would be occupied with stamping out the rising agrarian socialist movement in East Sichuan, with limited success. §!\n"
 SZC_national_populist_party: "YCP"
 SZC_national_populist_party_long: "Young China Party (Zhongguo Qingniandang)\n§LBorn from the student \"Young China Society\", the Young China Party would be one of the society's successors, as it split into \"nationalist\", \"socialist\" and \"idealist\" factions, led by Zeng Qi and Li Huang, Li Dazhao, and Wang Guangqi respectively. Travelling to France to study, Zeng Qi and Li Huang and the other members of their nationalist faction would engage in spats with other students in France such as Zhou Enlai, Cai Yuanpei and Li Shizeng.\n\nSometimes becoming violent, the amassment of support for the Chinese Syndicalist Party would result in Zeng and Li forming their own party, announcing the formation of the Young China Party in 1923, outside Paris. Developing rapidly amongst Chinese student organisations, the Young China Party would stand in concrete opposition towards the Kuomintang's cooperation with the CSP, and the YCP would return to Shanghai founding a series of political societies and newspapers in 1924.\n\nWith various top representatives of the YCP originating from Sichuan, the party possesses a popular and entrenched support base amongst the coalition of warlords and civilian institutions. Most notably, the YCP branches in Sichuan have gained the most ground over the interwar period, gifting the warlords of the basin with a party platform that allows them to maintain ideological parity with the systems of the KMT party armies. YCP functionaries run deep within both gentry networks and military high command of Yang Sen, Liu Cunhou, Liu Xiang and most of the Baoding Department, finding a ready home there. Though Yang Shuming is the provincial branch leader of the Sichuanese YCP, the main power leader in the area is Liu Siying, a radical frontman of the YCP aiming to carry out the nationalistic plans of Zeng Qi. Side by side with the warlord armies, both Yang and Liu work to carry out the vision of the Party of Chinese Youth.§!\n"

The PFAPO has been effective thus far in inducting new intellect into its ranks and its members have been active in communicating the goals of federalism to the masses. In terms of administrative style, though, Xiong and his men have also taken partially from what they have observed from Zhao Hengti's Hunanese Assembly during their short stints there in both 1924 and again in 1928, ingratiating themselves with the local conservative gentry and business interests while simultaneously being careful not to alienate the farmers and workers that make up most of Sichuan.\n\nRegardless, the PFAPO remains vigilant against Sichuan's main threats of banditry, resource scarcity and the persistent scheming of petty warlords, which are all frequent sources of social discontent that threaten to tarnish Xiong's standing with the public.§!\n"

Ostensibly formed as a philanthropist and charity organisation, the PWS has instead become infamous across Sichuan as a front for the vast provincial patronage networks, brotherhood secret societies, various bandit leaders and scheming rural landlords. Liu Wencai himself has become notorious as the main perpetrator of some of the society's worst excesses, not only being a ruthless landlord, but also extorting and taxing civilians for everything from prostitution to owning farming implements.\n\nCivil authorities across Sichuan, particularly those on the frontier, have found themselves frequently strong-armed by members of the PWS and the militia attached to the organ. Local courts and taxation offices have been exploited purely for the means of enriching Liu Wencai and his cronies. Liu's connections with the remnants of the provincial Chamber of Commerce have also worsened the influence of the PWS, with the few merchants who used their wits and financial resources to reach secret deals with local warlords now also falling under Liu Wencai's authority.\n\nLiu Wenhui's attempts to keep his brother in check up to this point have been ineffective, with the PWS and its connections in the Pao-Ge - the Sichuanese Gelaohui still eclipsing formal administrative posts in controlling economic and neighbourhood activity.§!\n"

Their calls for the various provinces to work towards implementing local self-government and then peacefully unite together into a federal republic achieved some traction, but after a promising start it was rejected by both northern and southern governments. The Zhili's successful unification by force discredited the movement, and many came to associate the movement as little more than a front for warlordism.\n\nRebuilding the momentum that was lost over a decade ago will be difficult, but the with the country once again seemingly hopelessly divided and the Zhili clique's liberalising efforts proving to be a sham, many hold out hope that the Federalist movement could be the solution to China's problems. Whilst few expect much from the often divided Sichuan Cliques, they bear the banner of last stand of Chinese Federalism."

Seeking to establish a structured, organised and centralised government, it places significant executive power within that of the President. However it features remarkable components such as a clear separation of powers and an outline of clear civil rights of the Chinese people. Rather unfortunately, its implementation a decade ago was marred by allegations of corruption and autocracy, having been conducted around the similar timeframe in which Cao's bribery scandal concluded.

 SZC_intellectualism_with_endeavour_desc: "The Endeavour Society, a long functioning intellectual organisation and article producer, was founded under the likes of Cai Yuanpei, Hu Shih, Li Dazhao, Liang Shuming, Wang Chonghui, Tao Menghe and many other reformist, later revolutionary in certain cases, intellectuals. Continuously championed by Hu Shih in some form, they represent one of the many Federalist blocs within the North's political scene. Sharing a mutual home during our exile, let us further integrate this think tank further into our government, however they expect much of our government. Most importantly, immediate reform of its institutions."

 SZC_public_safety_bureau: "The Public Safety Bureau"
 SZC_public_safety_bureau_desc: "The Public Safety Bureau, or PSB, is the name of the Intelligence Agency moonlighting as the Zhili's secret police, nominally led by Liu Menggeng and Wang Yujia. Utilising both their contacts within the Central Plains and elsewhere alongside their admirable experience in running Cao Kun's spy and intelligence rings, the entity has been established to ensure that the possibility of a Manchu Coup could never happen again. Espionage, suppression of internal dissent and counter-intelligence are just some of the many objectives the institution has been authorised to deal with."

 SZC_vindicating_the_invisible_element_idea: "Behind Manchu Lines"
 SZC_vindicating_the_invisible_element_idea_desc: "They may have squashed our military might on the surface, but little do the Royalists know that the Zhili networks and influence seeps deep into the earth of the Central Plains. Our beloved King of Baoding may have been mercilessly slaughtered at the hands of the Manchu Princes, but his networks remain forever strong. And willing to leverage us any benefit for the annihilation of our enemy."

 SZC_reconstituting_the_beiyang_navy: "Reconstituting the Beiyang Navy"
 SZC_reconstituting_the_beiyang_navy_desc: "Following through with a rather ambitious plan drawn up by restored Minister of the Navy, Admiral Sa Zhenbing, a significant portion of the country's budget is being prioritised for a state-planned modernisation and production effort of a brand new fleet of ships. It is hoped that by the end of this year plan, the Chinese Navy will have rapidly modernised, and will no longer sail ships of a decade before."

 SZC_western_revitalisation_plan_effect: "Western Revitalisation Plan"

 SZC_encourage_local_initiative_effect: "Encourage Local Initiative"

 SZC_crafting_talent_of_the_new_generation: "Crafting Talent of the New Generation"
 SZC_crafting_talent_of_the_new_generation_desc: "The most crucial element in developing China in our path to modernity is to properly educate the masses. As the masses learn the skills of the modern age, so too shall more of the people partake in the political system, and shore up our newfound democracy. We seek an educated populace guiding our Republic forward!"

 SZC_vaulting_militaristic_personalism: "Vaulting Militaristic Personalism"
 SZC_vaulting_militaristic_personalism_desc: "During the Chinese Civil War, various prominent warlords rose to great influence within the Federal military. These warlords command a force loyal not primarily loyal to the Republic, but to their commanding officer. If our Republic's democracy is to thrive, personalism must be rooted out from the source."

 SZC_government_union_partnership: "Government Union Partnership"
 SZC_government_union_partnership_desc: "Trade unions haven't been the most prominent force in China, primarily owing to the nation's agrarian nature that had been the norm for so long. However, as unification is achieved and Chinese industry takes the lead, workers must also gain representation. We must expand and integrate the unions so that workers from the silk farms of Sichuan, to the coal mines of Shanxi, and to the docks of Shanghai get their say."

 SZC_chinas_industrial_revolution: "China's Industrial Revolution"
 SZC_chinas_industrial_revolution_desc: "Having been embroiled in a plethora of turmoils until now, China has been a land split between subsistence farming in the west and various derelict industries in the East. But no longer! By educating our people on the benefits of industry and how to operate and construct, we shall seek to industrialise at a rapid speed, leveraging our previously untapped resources. We shall rival Britain in a decade's time!"

 SZC_specialised_practical_schools_0: "Specialised Practical Schools"
 SZC_specialised_practical_schools_0_desc: "Forming from examples pioneered in Nanchong, specialised practical schools have been established, with schools acquiring professional classes for training on matters of agriculture and sericulture, both integral industries, especially in Sichuan. More schools have also begun to introduce professional classes for science, liberal arts, traditional Chinese medicine, and heavy industry. Each of these specialised classes features its own practical workshops, farms, and clinical internships, promoting the integration of education and productive labour."

 SZC_finding_a_use_for_all: "Finding a Use for All"
 SZC_finding_a_use_for_all_desc: "National Centralisation is required, no time more so than right now, as China finally mostly falls under a new administration. Former political figures, whether they be politician or warlord, must be given work in productive developments lest they do nothing but obstruct and criticise the government. Similarly, the unemployed and idle must be pressed into technical programs to prepare them for China's industrial future, and all technical expertise must be utilised."

 SZC_the_national_demobilisation_programme: "The National Demobilisation Programme"
 SZC_the_national_demobilisation_programme_desc: "Now that unification is upon us, the issue of militarisation can once again be addressed. Excessive and runaway mobilisation by multiple actors has always been a problem across both Sichuan and Warlord China more generally. The time has come to standardise standing armies and drastically reduce the size of irregular and autonomous military formations, as we have promised the people from the start."

 SZC_new_style_education_scheme: "New Style Education Scheme"
 SZC_new_style_education_scheme_desc: "Lack of widespread education has always been the root of cultural backwardness throughout China, having been observed first-hand by General Liu Wenhui during his time in Sichuan. No doubt, the status quo needs reform - new public examinations must be organised, demonstration meetings must be hosted, and the top of the student cohorts are to be selected for more prestigious posts and commended for their achievements."

 SZC_true_purposes_of_knowledge_civic_democracy: "True Purposes of Knowledge: Civic Democracy"
 SZC_true_purposes_of_knowledge_civic_democracy_desc: "In order to move forward with the times, education must continually evolve to meet the demands of modernity. The lingering poison of the old imperial examination mindset must be dealt with!As educators and cultural workers, we have a historic duty: we must proclaim a declaration of intellectual independence, secure for students the freedom to learn, research, speak, and publish, and thereby complete the democratisation of educational spirit."

 SZC_true_purposes_of_knowledge_national_sacrifice: "True Purposes of Knowledge: National Sacrifice"
 SZC_true_purposes_of_knowledge_national_sacrifice_desc: "In order to move forward with the times, education must continually evolve to meet the demands of modernity. The lingering poison of the old imperial examination mindset must be dealt with! People ought not to think of pursuing education as a stepping-stone to high offices and riches. We must find ways for our brightest minds to devote themselves, within fifty years, not to becoming doctors of literature or philosophy, but to the study of raising livestock and agricultural cultivation - a true education of the people."

 Sichuan_Famine_decisions: "Famine Relief Efforts"
 Sichuan_Famine_decisions_desc: "The famine that wreaked havoc on Sichuan in 1925 has left a deep scar upon our people. While we've done what we can to prevent another one, the collapse of the League, persistent drought and rampant unrest has turned our worst fears into reality. We must now do everything we can to fight this famine.\n\n§1The famine will end when its §Y$MODIFIER_GLOBAL_MONTHLY_POPULATION$§! modifier reaches §!§Y0%§!

 SZC_International_Famine_Relief_desc: "China has endured a lot in recent years and there is only so much we can do to help ourselves. In places abroad, that have not been blighted by war or famine, there's more than enough grain to go around. We should appeal for them to help us in our time of need."

 SZC_Service_For_Food: "Service for Food"
 SZC_Service_For_Food_desc: "Every able-bodied man that can serve must do his part to overcome the disaster! As such, we'll offer civilians increased rations in exchange for military service and have these soldiers assist in the distribution of food to the masses."
 SZC_Labour_Relief: "Labour Relief"
 SZC_Labour_Relief_desc: "There isn't enough food to go around, so those that can must work to earn their rations. We'll set up a programme where the unemployed and able-bodied are conscripted as labourers and paid in rations to build the infrastructure and facilities we need to better combat the famine."
 SZC_Allocate_More_Government_Funds: "Allocate More Government Funds"
 SZC_Allocate_More_Government_Funds_desc: "In order to fight the famine, we'll need to step in with more resources from the government. This will, however, come at the expense of other state projects."
 SZC_Increase_Relief_Efforts: "Increase Relief Efforts"
 SZC_Increase_Relief_Efforts_desc: "It's clear that more must be done to distribute the food into the countryside. Local leaders in rural parts of Sichuan will be tasked with setting up programmes to distribute rice to their communities."
 SZC_Food_Banks: "Food Banks"
 SZC_Food_Banks_desc: "The government will work with farmers and Buddhist temples to bring food to the people of Sichuan, better helping us reach every level of society with our efforts to combat this disaster."
 SZC_Subsidise_Food_Production: "Subsidise Food Production"
 SZC_Subsidise_Food_Production_desc: "Sichuan has plenty of farmers, but since most of them don't earn enough to rely on anything but the weather and antiquated methods the spectre of a new famine looms with every drought. By stepping in with money from its own coffers, the state can help farmers combat waste and increase productivity."
 SZC_Enact_Price_Controls: "Enact Price Controls"
 SZC_Enact_Price_Controls_desc: "When the famine broke out many merchants started to hoard grain and rice while charging extortionate fees for these goods. The state, backed by the army if need be, will make sure no one profiteers from the misery of our people by enacting price controls."

Compared to the rest of China, they're largely left unscathed by the death of Marshal Sun and the subsequent turmoil. Because of this, they're in a position to help - whether their bureaucracy is willing to, however, is another matter altogether."

 Sichuan_Opium_Monopoly_decisions: "Sales Monopoly Bureau"
 Sichuan_Opium_Monopoly_decisions_desc: "The opium situation is beyond our control at this point and we're in no position to completely rid ourselves from it. Instead of eradicating the industry entirely, we'll bring it under the control of the state and put the profits from this vice into our coffers.\n\nCurrent Opium Control: £opium_texticon  [?SZC_opium_control|+%1]"
 SZC_Bureaucratic_Reforms: "Bureaucratic Reforms"
 SZC_Bureaucratic_Reforms_desc: "We need to take measures to mould the state bureaucracy into functioning less like a conventional one and more like a business as far as opium is concerned. By making gradual changes to this effect, we'll streamline our control over the market."
 SZC_Buy_Out_Merchants: "Buy Out Merchants"
 SZC_Buy_Out_Merchants_desc: "Sometimes the best way to deal with the competition is to simply buy it out. While a costly investment for the state to make, in due time these costs to our state coffers should be paid back through the profits we'll make."
 SZC_Forced_Acquisitions: "Forced Acquisitions"
 SZC_Forced_Acquisitions_desc: "By adopting a very literal interpretation of the law, we can send in the police to forcibly shut down a few private markets and use their goods and property to expand our monopoly."
 SZC_Tax_Harvesting_Scheme: "Tax Harvesting Scheme"
 SZC_Tax_Harvesting_Scheme_desc: "In order to increase revenues to fund our government plans, we can devote extra resources to local administrators and help their efforts to collect the taxes - old, current and new - owed to us and squeeze out every penny from those that thought they were above the law. It'll be unpopular, but it's for the good of Sichuan."
 SZC_Transit_Tariffs: "Transit Tariffs"
 SZC_Transit_Tariffs_desc: "We'll have the military and police establish checkpoints throughout the key roads and transit points around Sichuan to tax the transportation of opium. While a hassle for the commoner, it'll fill our coffers and prevent the competition from moving their goods."
 SZC_Farmer_Licensing: "Farmer Licensing"
 SZC_Farmer_Licensing_desc: "Every farm engaging in opium production will need a licence to operate from here on. Failure to comply will, of course, force us to confiscate their property."
 SZC_Uncontested_Monopoly: "Uncontested Monopoly"
 SZC_Uncontested_Monopoly_desc: "There is no more opium market in Sichuan, only a state monopoly that the criminals and smugglers can't touch. If they aren't directly under our control, they're de facto so through our regulations and taxes. While some may say that we're no better than the criminals we ousted, we've brought security and a steady stream of money to the state."
 SZC_Combat_Corruption: "Combat Corruption"
 SZC_Combat_Corruption_desc: "Our efforts to maintain market control are hampered by some of our officials taking bribes in order to turn a blind eye to the non-sanctioned opium businesses. By removing them, there'll be fewer cracks for the non-state actors to slip through."
 SZC_Combat_Smuggling: "Combat Smuggling"

 Sichuan_Opium_Removal_decisions: "Opium Prohibition Committee"
 Sichuan_Opium_Removal_decisions_desc: "Since the Treaty of Tianjin was imposed upon us, the opium trade has ravaged China and brought despair to millions of Chinese.

 SZC_Anti_Corruption_Campaigns: "Anti-Corruption Campaigns"
 SZC_Anti_Corruption_Campaigns_desc: "Our efforts in containing the spread of opium are greatly hindered by corrupt officials and civil servants that take bribes, embezzle funds and ignore the law when convenient.

 Sichuan_Diarchy_decisions: "The Diarchy"
 Sichuan_Diarchy_decisions_desc: "Unlike many warlord cliques in China, Baoding is noted for being more prone to cooperation than competition. If the balance is maintained it'll bring powerful benefits to Sichuan. Both sides need to give and take for the cooperation to work, for if one side becomes too dominant the diarchy may start to resemble the autocracies that surround it."
 SZC_Favour_The_Militarists: "Favour the Militarists"
 SZC_Favour_The_Militarists_desc: "By supporting the more conservative military wing through funding and favours, our army will reap the benefits while giving their faction a boost in the public eye. If the army is neglected, it'll degrade their performance in the field. Letting them grow too strong, however, risks crippling Sichuan's civilian branches of government. While it's certainly tempting to favour the army in times of war in particular, we should be careful not to provoke a hostile response by letting our administrative duties crumble."
 SZC_Favour_The_Bureaucrats: "Favour the Bureaucrats"
 SZC_Favour_The_Bureaucrats_desc: "By providing more resources and public support for the civilian branches of government, we'll see an well-oiled bureaucracy, more able to tackle the challenges that the province faces. Should we favour them too heavily, however, our army will suffer the results of spending cuts and perform worse in the field. If this goes on for too long, we can't rule out the army taking measures into their own hands to adjust this imbalance."

However brutally beaten, losing many good men along the way, the Remnant Zhili Forces join our native Sichuan armies as a spent force. On the bright side, all is not lost. With veterans from the ZhiFeng Wars, and intense experience fighting the Manchu armies in their withdrawal, the men are skilled, hardy and all too capable. We should seek to integrate and reform the Zhili forces, so that we can strike back on the war path against the Royalists, anyone else who dares stand in our way of national unification."
 SZC_Reorganise_The_Remnant_Divisions: "Reorganise the Remnant Divisions"

Once the Central Army, the Zhili are now reduced to a paltry force, outer Zhili members such as Tang Xiangming, or the League non-withstanding. Perhaps a costly endeavour, the §PMarshal§! has constructed a plan in-which the forces will be demobilised, reorganised and reconstituted into a group of elite \"Xinguojun\" divisions (New National Army). Despite the cost, it would provide a group of uniquely skilled and uniquely motivated soldiers for the army."

 Sichuan_Arms_Purchases_decisions: "Foreign Arms Deals"
 Sichuan_Arms_Purchases_decisions_desc: "Devout in our crusade against the Manchu and their royalists, this does not necessarily mean we are opposed to the practices and convictions of the imperialists. Not quite yet. After all, one thing at a time, no? Whilst our noble armament arsenals such as Chongqing and Daxian work around the clock to produce the artillery, the shells, the bullets and the rifles necessary to sustain our armies, another avenue for armaments has defined itself. Far reduced from our stature as the Central Government, internationally recognised, that does not matter in the scale of the arms trade. Looking towards a wider expanse of benefactors in the international arms area, we can arm ourselves for the great reconquest!"
 SZC_Purchase_Foreign_Guns: "Purchase Foreign Guns"
 SZC_Purchase_Foreign_Guns_desc: "With the increasing military modernisation around the globe, clearly in preparation for some broader national conflict on the horizon, international rifles are being rapidly modernised similarly. Resulting in an influx of outdated designs gathering dust in global stockpiles, our logistics staff have drafted a series of contracts in which we would purchase an assortment of excess armaments."
 SZC_Purchase_Support_Equipment: "Purchase Foreign Support Equipment"
 SZC_Purchase_Support_Equipment_desc: "A surprising hotbed of armament manufacturing and design, the Danish Madsen Machine Gun has proven itself an undeniably reliable, effective and wonderful support light machine gun for not just our soldiers, but that of armies in the here and now. The world's first true light machine gun produced in quantity, the military command staff has taken a particular liking to the Dane's support weaponry."
 SZC_Purchase_Artillery: "Purchase Foreign Artillery"
 SZC_Purchase_Artillery_desc: "A curious choice amongst our other potential military armament benefactors, the Swiss military industrial complex has nonetheless remained an admirable, if modest, national industry. With their neutrality ever present however, their equipment usually ends up for sale on the international weapons market. All too familiar with the fact that artillery is king in Chinese warfare, the Army would be all too delighted to receive modern guns, in significant quantity for once."

 SZC_Hire_RCW_Veterans: "Hire Russian Civil War Veterans"
 SZC_Hire_RCW_Veterans_desc: "With our relationship with Germany tenuous at best, and other imperialists distant due to our lack of legitimacy, many believe that our grand ambitions for a reconquest are bereft of assistance in military development. Yet there remains one Western, modern nation that has yet to openly oppose us as of recent. Russia.\n\nGranted, many despise the Russian Bear due to their previous colonial expansionist policies, such as the seizure of Outer Manchuria, or the further invasion of Dongbei in the wake of the Boxer Rebellion. Nonetheless, their disparaged, ambitious and older officers prove themselves incredibly fitting to substitute what the German advisors could provide. Clearly skilled in nearly all facets required of them."

 SZC_reconstruct_naval_pride: "Reconstruct Naval Pride"
 SZC_reconstruct_naval_pride_desc: "The Chinese fleet used to be one of the great major fleets of the whole world, ranking seventh in tonnage. Alas, having been sunk into the bottom of the ocean following the Sino-Japanese War, Chinese naval projections have never recovered; eternally cornered by the Rising Sun. With additional leeway following unification of the nation, the remaining naval cliques have pressured the government to finally begin China's grand naval rearmament programme, for the Middle Kingdom is awakening, and it must be able to protect its own waters."

 SZC_creating_the_chinese_airforce: "Creating the Chinese Airforce"
 SZC_creating_the_chinese_airforce_desc: "China's disparate regional airforce programs have overseen muddled or otherwise confused batches of progress over the years. With the most impressive results emerging from the Southwest in Kunming, and the Northeast within Shenyang, other local programs have not been as lucky. Liu Xiang's own native programme within Sichuan for example, used rocks akin to explosive bombs. If China is to be a true great power, it must be able to assert itself within the Third Avenue of Warfare, and thus, can spare no expense in rapidly developing its own air fleet."

 SZC_The_Yangtze_Lifeline: "The Yangtze Lifeline"
 SZC_The_Yangtze_Lifeline_desc: "Being a landlocked country, we conduct most of our trade along the Yangtze River and rely on merchant vessels to reach the rest of China and beyond. By partnering with a reliable manufacturer, we can make sure that we have enough ships to expand our trade along the river."

 SZC_Restart_The_Agricultural_Sector: "Restart the Agricultural Sector"
 SZC_Restart_The_Agricultural_Sector_desc: "Our agriculture was hit hardest in the civil war and the subsequent drought which has left it a shadow of its former self.

It'll be the first step on the road to turning the Sichuan basin into the bread basket of China."

 SZC_Rural_Construction_College: "Rural Construction College"
 SZC_Rural_Construction_College_desc: "The heavy focus on our industrial heartland has left the rural regions behind with many countryside communities looking like they did in the dynasties of old.

 SZC_Rice_And_Wheat_Improvement_Station: "Rice and Wheat Improvement Station"
 SZC_Rice_And_Wheat_Improvement_Station_desc: "Outdated farming techniques causes us a significant amount of wasted output across our agricultural sector.

 SZC_Expand_Dujiangyan_Irrigation_System: "Expand the Dujiangyan Irrigation System"
 SZC_Expand_Dujiangyan_Irrigation_System_desc: "Repairing Dujiangyan sufficed at first, but with our increased output and wealth it's high time we modernised and expanded it.

 SZC_Industrial_fabric: "Industrial Fabric"
 SZC_Industrial_fabric_desc: "Industrialisation has seen massive improvements both for the quality and quantity of the textile industry, yet the fruits of these developments have yet to see widespread adoption in our factories and workshops. It's high time that we started to adopt industrial silk production techniques on a large scale, and enable additional fabric for the military."

 SZC_Tianfu_Mining_Bureau: "Tianfu Mining Bureau"
 SZC_Tianfu_Mining_Bureau_desc: "By investing into expanding our current mining sector, we'll be able to reach more of Sichuan's riches. This will be vital not only for strengthening our economy, but will help us remain independent of foreign imports as well."

 SZC_Zigong_Saltworks: "Zigong Saltworks"
 SZC_Zigong_Saltworks_desc: "Salt has been an important cornerstone of Sichuanese economy since ancient times. While no longer the backbone it used to be in our industrialised economy, by expanding and modernising our salt mines we'll make sure it remains a profitable venture for us in the future as well."

 SZC_Extract_Natural_Gas: "Extract Natural Gas"

 SZC_Jialing_Coal_Fields: "Jialing Coal Fields"
 SZC_Jialing_Coal_Fields_desc: "Our industry is predominantly fuelled by coal. It keeps the lights on in our factories and it keeps our people warm. We must make sure that our coal production can keep pace with our demand for energy."

 SZC_Industrial_Planning_Committee: "Industrial Planning Committee"
 SZC_Industrial_Planning_Committee_desc: "Before we launch any major industrialisation programmes we need to set up a committee to assess our available resources after the civil war and plan the best approach for our future expansions. While it'll considerably expand the bureaucratic apparatus, the increased efficiency will pay dividends in the end."

 SZC_Import_Foreign_Machinery: "Import Foreign Machinery"
 SZC_Import_Foreign_Machinery_desc: "With both our industrial hubs of Chongqing and Chengdu badly battered by the war, we'll need to import equipment from abroad in order to get our industry back on its feet again. The planning committee has already laid out a budget for this and they only await our approval."

 SZC_Modern_Construction_Technology: "Modern Construction Technology"
 SZC_Modern_Construction_Technology_desc: "The Industrial Planning Committee has reached the conclusion that there's no way around the fact that our construction methods, tools and even basic know-how are all outdated. By bringing in more equipment and advisors to Sichuan, we'll be able to refine our construction methods."

 SZC_Study_Production_Innovations: "Study Production Innovations"
 SZC_Study_Production_Innovations_desc: "It's one thing to have access to advanced machinery, but if we are to be able to match the production methods of the Europeans and Japanese with our own, we need to study their respective approaches and apply what we learn to our own manufacturing techniques. As always, the IPC has budgeted for the associated costs."

 SZC_Urban_Modernisation_and_Sanitation: "Urban Modernisation and Sanitation"
 SZC_Urban_Modernisation_and_Sanitation_desc: "With our industry's rapid growth and the early successes of our urbanisation programme, the next step is to bring the great cities of Sichuan into the twentieth century by modernising their infrastructure to modern standards. It'll greatly improve living standards for the inhabitants and allow us to expand them further."

 SZC_Western_China_Academy_Of_Sciences: "Western China Academy of Sciences"
 SZC_Western_China_Academy_Of_Sciences_desc: "An important part of our modernisation plan is to make Sichuan a landmark for higher education in China. By establishing the Western China Academy of Sciences, we'll be able to better educate our citizens and attract some of the brightest minds in China to our country."

 SZC_Increase_Steel_Production: "Increase Steel Production"
 SZC_Increase_Steel_Production_desc: "Many of Sichuan's steel mills and ore mines use techniques and tools from the last century and sometimes these methods even more backwards and outdated to the point where they endanger our labourers. Bringing these methods into the current century will turn Chongqing into the beating heart of Chinese steel production."

 SZC_Rebuild_Chengdu_Machine_Bureau: "Rebuild the Chengdu Machine Bureau"
 SZC_Rebuild_Chengdu_Machine_Bureau_desc: "Underutilised before the war and damaged during it, the Chengdu Machine Bureau has great potential thanks to previous investments into its infrastructure. We'll rebuild it and make it a cornerstone of Chengdu's industrialisation process."

 SZC_Huaxi_Machinery_Factory: "Huaxi Machinery Factory"
 SZC_Huaxi_Machinery_Factory_desc: "With the rapid industrialisation efforts that we have planned, the ways of old are ceding ground as we utilise more and more machine tools and vehicles. In order to keep up with demand, our planners have proposed establishing industries in the Huaxi district, turning it into a model for industrialisation."

 SZC_Textile_Production: "Textile Production"
 SZC_Textile_Production_desc: "Chinese textiles are known far and wide for their quality and unique style. Sichuan has always had a large role in this trade and with both the increased demand for these goods and the relative safety of the basin these days, it'd be a good investment to deepen our role in this trade."

 SZC_Xikang_Hydropower: "Xikang Hydropower"
 SZC_Xikang_Hydropower_desc: "For the time being, most of Sichuan's energy needs comes from the use of coal power and natural gas. Our engineers tell us, however, that there's vast amounts of untapped energy in the mountainous west, offering numerous opportunities for the construction of hydro electric dams. This should allow our energy needs to keep pace with our growing industrialisation."

 SZC_Electrification_Efforts: "Electrification Efforts"
 SZC_Electrification_Efforts_desc: "Leave the confines of Chengdu and Chongqing and much of Sichuan is lit by candles and oil at night. With our energy generation efforts bearing fruits, however, we can finally bring electricity out to the countryside. Electricity will keep the countryside bright at night, our people warm in the winter and make our factories even more productive."

 SZC_Build_the_Electro_Steel_Mill: "Build the Electro-Steel Mill"
 SZC_Build_the_Electro_Steel_Mill_desc: "A big part of the plan to industrialise Sichuan was to construct an Electro-Steel Mill in Chongqing. But due to the many conflicts of the past, the mill was destroyed. Now that we have the power and industrial capabilities to do so, we can materialise this powerhouse of a mill again!"

 SZC_Modernised_Manufacturing: "Modernised Manufacturing"
 SZC_Modernised_Manufacturing_desc: "Our efforts that began with the reconstruction after the civil war have blossomed and helped turn Sichuan's basin into a small, if growing, industrial heartland. We can soon boast having some of the best industrial partners in all of China and reap even more rewards from our toil and hard work."

 SZC_The_Arsenal_Programme: "The Arsenal Programme"
 SZC_The_Arsenal_Programme_desc: "Chongqing has long boasted some capable military industry, with the Chongqing Arsenal being the biggest among them. The Industrial Planning Committee has proposed an expansion of the arsenal using the techniques and equipment they've acquired, allowing us to maintain our military production edge in the region."

 SZC_Expand_Production_Artillery: "Expand Production: Artillery"
 SZC_Expand_Production_Artillery_desc: "Sichuan is home to some of the most effective small arms production in China, but there's still room for improvement when it comes to heavier ordnance. Just like the Chongqing arsenal is known across China for its effective rifles, the Heijang Artillery Arsenal will bring modern artillery production methods to Sichuan."

 SZC_Expand_Production_Tanks: "Expand Production: Tanks"
 SZC_Expand_Production_Tanks_desc: "Tanks have proven their worth in the Weltkrieg and subsequent conflicts thanks to their ability to break through enemy defences. With our growing industrial base, we're finally in a position to start small-scale production of tanks that will help us dominate the Asian battlefields."

 SZC_Expand_Production_Aircraft: "Expand Production: Aircraft"
 SZC_Expand_Production_Aircraft_desc: "Often neglected by Chinese military planners, aircraft are becoming an indispensable part of any modern military. Because of Sichuan's mountainous geography, catching up here could be vital for future conflicts where planes will provide eyes in the sky for our troops and artillery and rain death from above upon our enemies."

 SZC_Rebuild_The_Sichuanese_Army: "Rebuild the Sichuanese Army"
 SZC_Rebuild_The_Sichuanese_Army_desc: "The current state of Sichuan's army leaves a lot to be desired. It's an outdated and splintered body lacking in cohesion. Our first step will be to bring the army together from its fractured background so that our soldiers can fight more effectively for their homeland."

 SZC_Rebuild_The_Officer_Corps: "Rebuild the Officer Corps"
 SZC_Rebuild_The_Officer_Corps_desc: "Fractured between many different factions, it's an unfortunate fact that our army's leadership is splintered and lacks a unified sense of strategy. By establishing our own Sichuanese military academy we can start instilling a proper understanding of modern warfare into our commanders."

 SZC_New_Infantry_Weapons: "New Infantry Weapons"
 SZC_New_Infantry_Weapons_desc: "Even by the standards of the rest of China, our army lags behind in many areas. It's time we started to combat this by taking steps to modernise our infantry divisions and give our soldiers the equipment they need to defend Sichuan."

 SZC_Import_Modern_Artillery: "Import Modern Artillery"
 SZC_Import_Modern_Artillery_desc: "As it stands, many of our artillery detachment use the same guns that they fielded in the conflicts of the past decades. This won't stand. Importing foreign artillery pieces and know-how would help us a great deal in mitigating this issue."

 SZC_Recon_Unit_Training: "Recon Unit Training"
 SZC_Recon_Unit_Training_desc: "Most of Sichuan's terrain is harsh with high mountains and mighty rivers covering most of our lands. Knowledge of the terrain can mean the difference between life and death. Let's make sure we're on the favourable side in that equation."

 SZC_Mountain_Warfare: "Mountain Warfare"
 SZC_Mountain_Warfare_desc: "What our army may lack in modern equipment can easily be made up for by using terrain to our advantage. With most of Sichuan and her neighbours being covered in rugged mountains, a company trained to fight among them can often be worth more than a division of regular soldiers."

 SZC_Adopt_The_Southern_Doctrine: "Adopt the Southern Doctrine"
 SZC_Adopt_The_Southern_Doctrine_desc: "We should not blindly modernise for the sake of modernisation. Our resources make it more prudent to adopt the Southern Doctrine instead and focus on what the Europeans call unconventional tactics but fit the Chinese hand like a glove. Whether it's large-front assaults or guerrilla warfare, we'll master at it."

 SZC_War_Logistics: "War Logistics"
 SZC_War_Logistics_desc: "Fielding a larger army means that we have a bigger supply chain to maintain. By creating a specialised department of logistics and assigning some of our more qualified officers to oversee it, we'll ensure that our troops stay supplied while minimising corruption and waste along the way."

 SZC_Asymmetric_Warfare: "Asymmetric Warfare"
 SZC_Asymmetric_Warfare_desc: "At the present it's unrealistic for us to try and match countries like Japan in terms of massed tanks, air power and artillery. Instead we should negate their advantages using our own cunning and encouraging our officers to rely of tactics that let their agile forces choose the terms of the battle, not the rigidly structured foe they face."

 SZC_Heavy_Fire_Tactics: "Heavy Fire Tactics"
 SZC_Heavy_Fire_Tactics_desc: "By training our officers and soldiers to detect weak points in the enemy's lines and quickly exploit them with overwhelming force, we can achieve breakthroughs more easily."

 SZC_Increase_Munitions_Production: "Increase Munitions Production"
 SZC_Increase_Munitions_Production_desc: "Our production of munitions need to keep pace with our increased use of heavy guns in the field. By investing into further optimising our production lines for shells and other munitions we will be able to keep up the pace and allow our front line officers to relentlessly bombard our enemies without any fears of shortages."

 SZC_Continue_The_Northern_Doctrine: "Continue the Northern Doctrine"
 SZC_Continue_The_Northern_Doctrine_desc: "What we lack in modern equipment we shall make up for by being adaptable, quick and resourceful. With speed and perseverance we will outmanoeuvre our enemies, be it through our officers cunning and initiative or our troops peerless ability to march and fight across great distances."

 SZC_Focus_On_Speed: "Focus on Speed"
 SZC_Focus_On_Speed_desc: "We'll train our troops in path-finding and invest in equipment like improved boots and tyres to fine-tune our army's performance. By doing this, we're sure to dictate the terms of battle and where it's fought!"

 SZC_Improved_Army_Training: "Improved Army Training"
 SZC_Improved_Army_Training_desc: "An army of untrained soldiers is hardly more effective than a mob of bandits. Although our efforts to improve the training of both our soldiers and officers have been substantial, there's still room for more refinement. We don't just want a good army - we should aim to have the most professional one in all of China."

 SZC_Anti_Tank_Preparations: "Anti-Tank Preparations"
 SZC_Anti_Tank_Preparations_desc: "Tall mountains, deep valleys and wide rivers. Nearly every inch of our land is a potential death trap for enemy tank crews and we'll make sure that our soldiers make the most of this fact."

 SZC_Study_Tank_Designs: "Study Tank Designs"
 SZC_Study_Tank_Designs_desc: "The tank has proven to be a key component in the modern battlefield. We cannot afford to lag behind in this development and must study the tank designs of Germany, France and Japan to develop our own armoured companies."

 SZC_Irregular_Tactics: "Irregular Tactics"
 SZC_Irregular_Tactics_desc: "The mountains, forests and cities have long been the only reliable allies for our armed forces. Our expertise in using asymmetrical warfare has served us well in the past and it will keep doing so in the future as well."

 SZC_Decentralised_Chain_Of_Command: "Decentralised Chain of Command"
 SZC_Decentralised_Chain_Of_Command_desc: "It's essential that our soldiers and officers act on their own initiative. While our enemy lays idle while waiting for instructions from the head of the army, our brave men will use their own heads instead!"

 SZC_Night_Warfare: "Night Warfare"
 SZC_Night_Warfare_desc: "The darkness of night may blind conventional armies, but we've learned how to use it as an asset. Even an open field can be turned into an ambush spot and provide cover from enemy detection and fire. We'd be fools not to make the most of it."

 SZC_Army_Of_Shadows: "Army of Shadows"
 SZC_Army_Of_Shadows_desc: "We'll defeat our foes not by sacrificing our soldiers in head-on assaults, but with a thousand cuts from the shadows. Behind their lines, in their cities and even from within their ranks - there nowhere will our enemies find safety. Deception and cunning will win the day, not the foolhardy sacrifices of soldiers so many careless warlords commit."

 SZC_Professional_Legacy: "Professional Legacy"
 SZC_Professional_Legacy_desc: "Most of our commanders trace our military roots back to the esteemed Baoding Army Academy and many more are influenced by its teachings. We must build upon this legacy and turn Sichuan's army into a professional and disciplined military force worthy of respect."

 SZC_Military_Education_Corps: "Military Education Corps"
 SZC_Military_Education_Corps_desc: "Far too often military teachings put emphasis on the officers, with little regard for the education of the soldiers. With the right education, not only will our soldiers know how to drill and march, but they'll also have a keen eye for doctrine and its applications on a tactical level as well."

 SZC_Well_Trained_Officers: "Well-Trained Officers"
 SZC_Well_Trained_Officers_desc: "Many of China's modern heroes learned how to fight in the Baoding Army Academy. Carrying this legacy forward, we must make sure to do our utmost to ensure that as many of China's future heroes are trained in our academies. In producing excellent officers, even the Europeans will have to learn to respect us."

 SZC_Army_Of_Professionals: "Army of Professionals"
 SZC_Army_Of_Professionals_desc: "Much of China's suffering has come from warlords and corrupt officials pretending that an unruly mob can act as an army - let alone take a city without behaving like bandits in the process. We shall instead create an army of well-trained soldiers and officers, one that will fight for China with discipline and honour in equal measure."

 SZC_Doctrinal_Innovation: "Doctrinal Innovation"
 SZC_Doctrinal_Innovation_desc: "An army is only as good as its doctrine. If we don't adapt to the modern battlefield and its conditions, we'll be left in the dustbin of history. It's high time that we refine our tactics and strategies."

 SZC_Equipment_Standardisation: "Equipment Standardisation"
 SZC_Equipment_Standardisation_desc: "During the days of the warlords, any logistics officer would often have the unenviable burden of every local war band, governor militia and splinter force having their own rifles, ammunition and uniforms. More steps need to be taken to streamline our equipment, from the smallest manufacturing floors, all the way into the battlefield."

 SZC_Engineer_Units: "Engineer Units"
 SZC_Engineer_Units_desc: "Our home of Sichuan is a harsh landscape to fight in with its tall mountains and wide rivers. As such, specialised detachments of engineers ought to be used as much as possible to allow our forces to build the best defences and surmount the mightiest of fortifications."

 SZC_Improved_Army_Drills: "Improved Army Drills"
 SZC_Improved_Army_Drills_desc: "It is true that while our soldiers are disciplined and brave, our training methods sometimes leave something to be desired as our training methods haven't always kept pace with other developments. We need to refine our methods and make sure our soldiers perform to the utmost of their ability."

 SZC_Creative_Solutions: "Creative Solutions"
 SZC_Creative_Solutions_desc: "Sichuan and indeed most surrounding provinces are inhospitable for any army and difficult to traverse. A clever and cost-effective solution to the restrictions on mobility could be the widespread implementation of bicycle infantry, proven by the previous war in Europe to be effective even in some of the most demanding war zones."

 SZC_Chengdu_Holds_On: "Chengdu Holds On"
 SZC_Chengdu_Holds_On_desc: "Neither treacherous deceit nor backstabbing opportunism could stand up to the strength and courage of the Accelerated Department. Yang Sen holds on to power despite the odds and now the Accelerated Department will deal with these rebels once and for all."

 SZC_Evict_Officer_Department: "Evict the Officer Department"
 SZC_Evict_Officer_Department_desc: "Yunnan's Federalist and KMT lapdogs have been a thorn in our side for far too long, having waged a guerrilla campaign against us since the 1920s. With the civil war won and our enemies on the run, it's time we chase them out of Sichuan once and for all."

 SZC_Restore_Order_In_Chongqing: "Restore Order in Chongqing"
 SZC_Restore_Order_In_Chongqing_desc: "Chongqing is the industrial heartland of Sichuan. Even though Liu Xiang is gone, the city itself was badly scarred in the civil war and remains in a state of turmoil. We need to use the army re-establish government control over the city and bring stability to its inhabitants."

 SZC_Bring_Peace_to_Sichuan: "Bring Peace to Sichuan"
 SZC_Bring_Peace_to_Sichuan_desc: "With the other factions gone and order restored to most of the country, all that's left is to clear out the last holdouts and restore government control to the last few villages in the country affected by turmoil and banditry. It won't be long before the worst scars of the war are finally mended."

 SZC_Yang_Sens_Ambition: "Yang Sen's Ambition"
 SZC_Yang_Sens_Ambition_desc: "Yang Sen has ruled over Sichuan with a firm hand since the Qing restoration, but the internal strife never allowed him to fulfil his vision for Sichuan. With all enemies from both within and without dealt with, he can finally realise his ambition for a modern and prosperous Sichuan."

 SZC_Centralise_The_Province: "Centralise the Province"
 SZC_Centralise_The_Province_desc: "Chengdu may be the seat of the government, but the reach of our administration's reach doesn't reach all of Sichuan. By reforming our administration so that the local mayors answer to the governor in Chengdu rather than their own agenda, we'll make the Department's control over the province more effective."

 SZC_Armed_And_Ready: "Armed and Ready"
 SZC_Armed_And_Ready_desc: "Even though peace has been brought back to Sichuan, it's likely only a matter of time until we have to go to war again. Let's expand our arms production so that we're prepared for when that day arrives."

 SZC_Modernising_Sichuan: "Modernising Sichuan"
 SZC_Modernising_Sichuan_desc: "Sichuan is currently nowhere near its full potential thanks to the wastefulness, bickering and inaction caused by our rivals. We need to take the first bold steps towards bringing all of Sichuan into the modern era, starting with our cities."

 SZC_A_Break_With_Tradition: "A Break With Tradition"
 SZC_A_Break_With_Tradition_desc: "The ways of old shouldn't be venerated to a fault. It isn't just the cities and infrastructure that need to be brought into the modern era, but the way we think and act as well. This should be reflected in how our administrators and researchers work as well, of course."

 SZC_Parks_And_Venues: "Parks and Venues"
 SZC_Parks_And_Venues_desc: "The beauty of Sichuan's forests and basins are foreign to many of those living in our biggest cities. Given our goal of urbanisation, it's only fair to bring that beauty into the cities as well."

 SZC_Popular_Education_Institute: "Popular Education Institute"
 SZC_Popular_Education_Institute_desc: "No longer constrained by old ways and outdated methods, we need to establish modern research facilities so that we can reap the rewards of our hard work. Soon, Sichuan will be known far and wide as a centre of thought and research in Asia."

 SZC_City_Administration: "City Administration"
 SZC_City_Administration_desc: "The next step in our modernisation plan is an overhauling of the administrations in the major cities and their bureaucracies. They're currently outdated, decentralised and full of cracks. By creating a more effective administrative framework, we're certain to see a rise in productivity."

 SZC_Road_Construction: "Road Construction"
 SZC_Road_Construction_desc: "The roads that connect our cities often wouldn't look out of place in the Qin dynasty, assuming any exist at all. Step by step, we'll replace them with paved ways that we can quickly transport cargo, goods and soldiers across."

 SZC_Farmers_Markets: "Farmers' Markets"
 SZC_Farmers_Markets_desc: "Part of modernising the country is to bring the farmer's goods into the cities by giving economic incentives for the creation of more farmers' markets, centralising the commerce around the agricultural sector. It'll enrich both us and our farmers and make lives easier in the cities as well."

 SZC_The_Luzhou_Woodworks: "The Luzhou Woodworks"
 SZC_The_Luzhou_Woodworks_desc: "With its location along the Yangtze, Luzhou is an excellent location to establish a new industrial zone for lumber, both for our own use and to trade along the river."

 SZC_A_Man_Of_The_People: "A Man of the People"
 SZC_A_Man_Of_The_People_desc: "Yang Sen's rule has been firm, but fair. For over a decade he's guided Sichuan's people through hardship and into prosperity. Not just a common warlord like the others, he's truly a man of the people and a father figure to the modern Sichuanese province he's helped build."

 SZC_Liu_Cunhous_Tradition: "Liu Cunhou's Tradition"
 SZC_Liu_Cunhous_Tradition_desc: "Given their vastly conflicting visions for the future of Sichuan, Yang Sen and Liu Cunhou's partnership wasn't meant to last. Now with Liu Cunhou and the Armament Department in charge, Sichuan will finally know peace and order without and dangerous radicalism burdening us."

 SZC_Build_Up_The_Province: "Build Up the Province"
 SZC_Build_Up_The_Province_desc: "The wars and strife have scarred our province. Before any further steps are taken, we need to take actions to mend Sichuan with our strength and tools so that we'll once more have a foundation in place for a strong nation and people."

 SZC_Rally_The_Warlords: "Rally the Warlords"
 SZC_Rally_The_Warlords_desc: "Many strongmen across Sichuan hold control over militias and play an important role in the country. Rather than struggling for power, we should rally them to Liu Cunhou and create a united front within Sichuan with a degree of autonomy for them all in return."

 SZC_The_Daxian_Mint: "The Daxian Mint"
 SZC_The_Daxian_Mint_desc: "Up until now, the practice of local warlords and mayors making their own money has led to confusion at best and fraudulent waste at worst. We should turn this practice into a tightly controlled state monopoly instead."

 SZC_Heavenly_Announcements: "'Heavenly Announcements'"
 SZC_Heavenly_Announcements_desc: "With Sichuan firmly under our control, we need to build up our coffers before we do anything else. 'Heavenly announcements' will be declared by Cunhou and the people will need to pay them. Some may call it greedy, but would they really do so when our decrees are backed by our loyal army?"

 SZC_Confucian_Dominance: "Confucian Dominance"
 SZC_Confucian_Dominance_desc: "It's an unfortunate fact that the role of faith has had a diminished role because of more pressing earthly matters. Now that we finally know peace again, we'll promote our religious traditions as the rallying point for our people, to give them hope in harsh times and bring stability to our nation."

 SZC_Four_Virtues_Movement: "Four Virtues Movement"
 SZC_Four_Virtues_Movement_desc: "We should actively encourage people to participate the State's neo-Confucian movements. By actively participating in these religious organisations, the people will get a better understanding of the cornerstones of Confucian thought. It'll help connect the people to their religion, and tie the state to this religion."

 SZC_A_Nationalist_Haven: "A Nationalist Haven"
 SZC_A_Nationalist_Haven_desc: "For us to endure in these troubled times we must become a stronghold of nationalism. While radicals such as the Kuomintang would seek to uproot the very essence of our nation we'll embrace it. A love for China being the shield that protects us from harm, and the sword that strikes down our enemies."

 SZC_Confucian_Schooling: "Confucian Schooling"
 SZC_Confucian_Schooling_desc: "If an education system is to exist in Sichuan, it should promote religious and traditionalist values first and foremost. Some of the money gained through the Heavenly Announcements should therefore go to fund the construction of more schools to combat the scourges of illiteracy and irreligiosity that still haunt Sichuan."

 SZC_A_Victory_From_Baoding: "A Victory from Baoding"
 SZC_A_Victory_From_Baoding_desc: "Once more, the professionalism and dedication of the Baoding Department has won the day. With their rule over the province secured, Sichuan can now forge its own destiny."

 SZC_The_Diarchy: "The Diarchy"
 SZC_The_Diarchy_desc: "Unlike other cliques guided by the lofty ambitions of one autocrat, the cooperation between two factions has kept them from being dominated by one internal clique. Though the balance of power may shift back and forth between them, this cooperation will continue as the diarchy's reforms start to shape Sichuan."

 SZC_Repair_The_Wars_Damage: "Repair the War's Damage"
 SZC_Repair_The_Wars_Damage_desc: "Much of Sichuan lies in ruins following the war. From the cities and out to the countryside, most of the east and south was consumed by the fighting. Restoring our infrastructure and cities ought to be a top priority for our new administration."

 SZC_Distribute_Grain: "Distribute Grain"
 SZC_Distribute_Grain_desc: "Although the war and drought hit our province hard, there's still surplus grain in a handful of depots held by the military. Since the fighting is over, we should have our soldiers help distribute it throughout the countryside."

 SZC_Build_Up_Support: "Build Up Support"
 SZC_Build_Up_Support_desc: "Not only did our department rise to power through conflict and the collapse two other cliques, but our ideas don't have a universal appeal with the public either. If we don't make an effort to win people's hearts, we may become the third Sichuanese regime to collapse."

 SZC_Fight_Corruption: "Fight Corruption"
 SZC_Fight_Corruption_desc: "Other cliques throughout China are rightfully despised for being corrupt and self-serving. We should prove that we're different by actively rooting out corruption and prove to the people that we have the best interests of the province in mind."

 SZC_A_Model_Province: "A Model Province"
 SZC_A_Model_Province_desc: "Representing a more traditionalist side of the diarchy, the lifelong career officer Deng Xihou seeks to turn Sichuan into a model for all of China through balanced social and economic reforms. Popular with the rural population and the military, his reforms will see the latter gain prominence, leading to a more disciplined army."

 SZC_Moral_Invigoration: "Moral Invigoration"
 SZC_Moral_Invigoration_desc: "Corruption, war, famine and countless other struggles have had their toll on our people. A good place to start the healing process and overcome these years of hardship is with a campaign to restore the virtues of morality into our people. With a strong spirit, the effort to rebuild Sichuan will be swifter."

 SZC_Culture_Of_Productivity: "Culture of Productivity"
 SZC_Culture_Of_Productivity_desc: "A strong work ethic can be more powerful than any tool. Our people should be encouraged to feel a strong sense of pride in their labour and joy in being able to contribute to their communities and their prosperity."

 SZC_Combat_Vice: "Combat Vice"
 SZC_Combat_Vice_desc: "The scourges of addiction, gambling and other immoralities harm our people and lead them to fruitless lives of criminality rather than ones of virtue and fulfilment. More efforts should be made to help combat vice and help those consumed by it to return to a normal, healthy living."

 SZC_Civic_Nationalism: "Civic Nationalism"
 SZC_Civic_Nationalism_desc: "Every citizen of Sichuan should feel a sense of pride in their province. Rather than encouraging envy and anger and we'll channel this pride towards further improving the lives of the Sichuanese."

 SZC_Support_Rural_Reconstruction: "Support Rural Reconstruction"
 SZC_Support_Rural_Reconstruction_desc: "During peacetime, the countryside has been neglected in favour of the great cities of Chengdu and Chongqing. During the war, it was hit hard by advancing armies. Our rural citizens deserve to finally be given the care they deserve."

 SZC_Farmer_Credit: "Farmer Credit"
 SZC_Farmer_Credit_desc: "As part of our programme to ease the burden on our rural regions, we'll issue state subsidies to help our struggling farmers recover in the wake of their recent hardships. Keeping the countryside prosperous and stable will pay dividends for all of Sichuan."

 SZC_Model_Farm_Program: "Model Farm Programme"
 SZC_Model_Farm_Program_desc: "With our agricultural sector restored, the time has come to build upon it. A model farm programme for the model province, one to make our farmers the most productive and prosperous in all of China. The programme will encompass funding towards modern irrigation and mechanised equipment and is sure to lead to a farming boom."

 SZC_Rural_Road_Plan: "Rural Roads Plan"
 SZC_Rural_Road_Plan_desc: "Beyond the few transit hubs connecting the major cities, a significant portion of our roads are the same trails that we've walked for generations. By linking up our smaller townships with proper roads we'll ease the lives of our rural population and provide a boost to their local economies."

 SZC_Build_Hospitals: "Build Hospitals"
 SZC_Build_Hospitals_desc: "The state of our health services leave much to be desired due to historical neglect for generations. The people of Sichuan deserve better than this. We'll set aside more funds for the construction of major hospitals, local clinics, as well as the training of doctors."

 SZC_Peoples_Welfare: "People's Welfare"
 SZC_Peoples_Welfare_desc: "Helping out your fellow man down on his luck is not a matter of left or right, nor a question of reformism or traditionalism. The state of Sichuan will help its poor like institutions from states to monasteries have for millennia in China. It's nothing less than our diligent and moral people deserve."

 SZC_The_University_Of_Chengdu: "The University of Chengdu"
 SZC_The_University_Of_Chengdu_desc: "Plans have long existed for the construction of a university in Chengdu that will be up to international standards. The time has come to finally realise this vision and turn Chengdu into one of Asia's great centres of learning."

 SZC_A_Modern_Province: "A Modern Province"
 SZC_A_Modern_Province_desc: "Liu Wenhui represents the a more reformist side of the diarchy. He seeks to fully modernise Sichuan with reforms that, while not outright revolutionary, break from some traditional norms and are popular in the cities and with the administrative classes. His reforms are sure to lead to a more well-oiled bureaucracy."

 SZC_Reform_The_Civil_Service: "Reform the Civil Service"
 SZC_Reform_The_Civil_Service_desc: "The civil service is outdated, a relic of the past era of bickering warlords. The first step towards bringing our administration up to date should be to reform our civil services and have a unified framework for them across the region."

 SZC_National_Government_School: "National Government School"
 SZC_National_Government_School_desc: "A lot of our public servants are untrained, a holdover from past administrations. We should standardise their training and the rules they operate under so that everyone in Sichuan knows that they can rely on their government representatives."

 SZC_Industrial_Modernisation: "Industrial Modernisation"
 SZC_Industrial_Modernisation_desc: "Much of Sichuan's industry, even the mighty factories in Chongqing, often resemble the ones of the last century more than this one. Efforts should be made to update them to the standards seen in more developed parts of Asia."

 SZC_Institute_Of_Technical_Research: "Institute of Technical Research"
 SZC_Institute_Of_Technical_Research_desc: "Our industries often rely of a kind of brute force. Numbers, volume, magnitude. Very little effort has been made, however, to empathise technique and refinement of methods. By better training our workers and technicians, we'll be able to maximise the efficiency of what we already have."

 SZC_Light_Industrial_Development: "Light Industrial Development"
 SZC_Light_Industrial_Development_desc: "Sichuan's industrial economy has mostly relied on massive factory complexes. Broadening our focus to encompass smaller industries with a focus on more nimble, precise engineering and production will diversify our economy and bring our industrial boom to the countryside."

 SZC_Shenghang_Hydropower_Plant: "Shenghang Hydropower Plant"
 SZC_Shenghang_Hydropower_Plant_desc: "There's still a lot of untapped energy potential in hydroelectric power and Sichuan's terrain is perfect from it. If the construction plans for a hydroelectric plant in Shenghang are realised, we'll be able to fulfil much of our country's energy needs and expand our economy."

 SZC_Attract_Foreign_Intellectuals: "Attract Foreign Intellectuals"
 SZC_Attract_Foreign_Intellectuals_desc: "A wise man knows that he has a lot to learn and a good government will not be afraid to use the best talents from abroad to improve the lot of their people. By attracting some of the brightest minds from Asia, America and Europe to Sichuan, we'll be able to drastically improve our educational and research efforts."

 SZC_Buddhist_Influence: "Buddhist Influence"
 SZC_Buddhist_Influence_desc: "Wenhui may be a reformer, but a lot of his visions have a foundation in Buddhist thought. By bringing this to the forefront and gaining the assistance from Buddhist institutions in Sichuan, we'll be able to win more support for our ideas among Sichuan's more traditionalist elements."

 SZC_Break_The_Gender_Roles: "Break the Gender Roles"
 SZC_Break_The_Gender_Roles_desc: "With the advancements in technology, there's no reason for women to be forced out of traditionally male roles. Advancements in military technology even let them take the fight to the enemy, be it with a rifle in their hands or in the cockpit of a plane."

 SZC_Protect_The_Tibetans: "Protect the Tibetans"
 SZC_Protect_The_Tibetans_desc: "Though we may not always see eye to eye with the government of Tibet, we should do our best do make sure that the Tibetans living within our borders are treated fairly both by the state and its citizens."

 SZC_Chongqing_Victory: "Chongqing Victory"
 SZC_Chongqing_Victory_desc: "The dice were cast and Liu Xiang's gamble paid off. The Zhili may have denied him the governorship in the past, but now he holds all of Sichuan in his iron fist. A man of great ambitions, he's unlikely to stop here."

 SZC_Consolidate_The_Province: "Consolidate the Province"
 SZC_Consolidate_The_Province_desc: "The war has been won and the petty warlords vanquished, but we can't rest on our laurels. There is plenty of work to be done and we must take steps to secure or victory and expand our base of power beyond Chongqing, by force if others make it necessary."

 SZC_Family_Matters: "Family Matters"
 SZC_Family_Matters_desc: "One of the most prominent figures of the defeated Baoding Department in Sichuan is Liu Wenhui, the warlord of Xikang and also Liu Xiang's uncle. It's an unfortunate state of affairs, but one which will have to be addressed one way or another. Liu Xiang hopes he'll come to his senses, but is nonetheless prepared for the worst should he be stubborn in his opposition."

 SZC_Align_The_Minor_Warlords: "Align the Minor Warlords"
 SZC_Align_The_Minor_Warlords_desc: "Even though our rivals are dead or exiled, several lesser warlords remain with their own militias, posing a threat to our power. Some of them can be brought on board by integrating them into our armies and police forces and the rest can surely be pacified once their numbers become irrelevant."

 SZC_Entice_The_Urban_Merchants: "Entice the Urban Merchants"
 SZC_Entice_The_Urban_Merchants_desc: "Order cannot be maintained at gunpoint alone. If we are to succeed, we need to win over the region's wealthy bourgeoisie, small as it may be, to our cause. With the right mix of carrots and the occasional stick, we're sure that they'll see the benefits of siding with us."

 SZC_Form_The_National_Protection_Alliance: "Form the National Protection Alliance"
 SZC_Form_The_National_Protection_Alliance_desc: "It's finally time for the independent governors of China to assert themselves against the Beijing regime. [SZC.GetLeader] will therefore try to create an alliance between us and our like-minded partners in the region against the Zhili. Once they're finally dealt with, the rest should surely fall in line behind our leadership."

 SZC_A_Grandiose_Plan: "A Grandiose Plan"
 SZC_A_Grandiose_Plan_desc: "Ever since Liu Xiang was denied the governorship of Sichuan, the Zhili and their lapdogs have done nothing but hold us back. We can only tolerate this for so long. It's high time that [SZC.GetLeader] marched his army into Beijing and shattered them, once and for all - uniting all of China under his rule if he has to."

 SZC_The_Lord_Of_Sichuan: "The Lord of Sichuan"
 SZC_The_Lord_Of_Sichuan_desc: "With [SZC.GetLeader]'s undisputed rule over Sichuan now a fact, the age of bickering warlords is finally over. Now that all the pieces are on place and any potential threat to the Accelerated Department has been either destroyed or pacified, we can finally forge ahead and decide Sichuan's fate for ourselves."

 SZC_Famine_Relief_Corps: "Famine Relief Corps"
 SZC_Famine_Relief_Corps_desc: "The people - or our soldiers, for that matter - cannot feed themselves from bark, grass and clay. Since the recent civil war created countless prisoners of war from the traitorous factions, we'll offer them the prospect of amnesty in exchange for tilling the fallow fields and preparing the distribution of food. Under close watch of our soldiers, of course."

 SZC_Aggressive_Modernisation: "Accelerated Modernisation"
 SZC_Aggressive_Modernisation_desc: "The old regime evidently didn't bother to catch up with the rest of the China. Instead, it clearly neglected its duty to its people and now we're the backwater of China. Our people will need to work hard to make up for the past decade's neglect and we'll make sure it bears fruit."

 SZC_Fund_The_Construction_Industry: "Fund the Construction Industry"
 SZC_Fund_The_Construction_Industry_desc: "Yang Sen was content to simply lord over fields of opium that wouldn't look out of place in the worst periods of the 19th century. If we are to bring Sichuan into the new era, however, the state will need to invest big in order to make it happen. Spare no expenses today, so that the next generation will be prosperous!"

 SZC_The_Riches_Of_Xikang: "The Riches of Xikang"
 SZC_The_Riches_Of_Xikang_desc: "The wealth of Xikang lays mostly untapped beneath the mountains. We'll need a modern steel industry so that our mighty military can march into battle with the rifles, cannons, vehicles and ships that they need."

 SZC_Expand_Arms_Production: "Expand Arms Production"
 SZC_Expand_Arms_Production_desc: "The original ambitions of Liu Xiang always accounted for the inevitability of war. The Accelerated Department rose to prominence through conflict, and we're unlikely to bring peace to China without more bloodshed. Whether it's defensive or offensive, we need to arm ourselves for fend off our future foes as well."

 SZC_Mass_Education_Campaigns: "Mass Education Campaigns"
 SZC_Mass_Education_Campaigns_desc: "It wasn't just the cities that were neglected by the old Qing overlords and their stooges, but the minds of Sichuan's people as well. Illiteracy runs rampant and most people are clueless as to their rich history and duty to the state. Our literate officers shall act as teachers and the masses will learn by the millions."

 SZC_Currency_Reform: "Currency Reform"
 SZC_Currency_Reform_desc: "Before we defeated our rivals, every local province's warlord had their own worthless currency. That is, if they weren't even relegated to an ancient barter economy. Now that we're in charge, it's time we stamp out these vestiges of the past and start to use one united currency for one united Sichuan."

 SZC_Sichuan_Central_Bank: "Sichuan Central Bank"
 SZC_Sichuan_Central_Bank_desc: "Up until recently much of Sichuan's economy has been splintered into various local financial ecosystems under local mayors and warlords. By finally creating a centralised banking system with its beating heart centred in Chongqing we will be able to break this trend and drive our economy in one unified direction."

 SZC_Standardise_Land_Tax: "Standardise Land Tax"
 SZC_Standardise_Land_Tax_desc: "The old tax system was a byzantine mess. Depending on which province you were in, it was either broken, inefficient or a governor's attempt to rob the people blind. We'll do away with this nonsense and implement our own centralised tax law, free from the grift and inefficiency of the past."

 SZC_Urban_Expansion: "Urban Expansion"
 SZC_Urban_Expansion_desc: "We cannot call ourself a modern nation unless we urbanise. We must encourage people to move in from the countryside and devote everything into expanding our cities. After we're done, Chongqing and Chengdu may well be the envy of Shanghai and Hong Kong!"

 SZC_The_Mighty_Navy: "The Mighty Navy"
 SZC_The_Mighty_Navy_desc: "Our capital of Chongqing rests near the Yangtze River, leaving it rather vulnerable to naval attacks from downriver, but also making it into a perfect base for the future navy of Sichuan. Eventually, a mighty armada of ships shall patrol the rivers, protecting our trade and people from banditry and showing our might to the rest of China."

 SZC_The_Mighty_Air_Force: "The Mighty Air Force"
 SZC_The_Mighty_Air_Force_desc: "Why should we scale the mountains of Sichuan to meet every threat when planes can simply attack them from the air? We'll start by importing foreign technology to use as a base. Once we're done, our air force will be the greatest in all of China, able to protect our skies and strike any foe!"

 SZC_Army_Drills: "Army Drills"
 SZC_Army_Drills_desc: "For far too long, the warlords of Sichuan were content with their forces resembling bandits more than actual soldiers. To mark a clear break from this past, the Chongqing high command is preparing for a programme of province-wide army drilling and retraining. With enough effort, we'll have soldiers that are the most disciplined in all of China!"

 SZC_Adopt_Radio_Communications: "Adopt Radio Communications"
 SZC_Adopt_Radio_Communications_desc: "Modern wars are increasingly fought with the help of radio, radar and computing machines. It's therefore crucial for our modernisation programme that we procure and develop new advances in these fields and that our forces, down to every company, receive training in their use."

 SZC_Dedicated_Logistics_Units: "Dedicated Logistics Units"
 SZC_Dedicated_Logistics_Units_desc: "Even after our army becomes the mightiest in China - at least on paper - it'll be helpless in the field without a steady stream of supplies to keep it marching forward. By utilising Chongqing's industry, we'll set up specialised supply trains that will be the envy of all Chinese military planners!"

 SZC_Large_Front_Operations: "Large Front Operations"
 SZC_Large_Front_Operations_desc: "The key to winning battles is to properly utilise the vast manpower of Sichuan to wear down and overwhelm our foes. While a common warlord would simply use them as a bludgeon, we'll develop sophisticated methods for using large infantry charges as our spearheads, including the management and rapid deployment of reserves."

 SZC_Reverse_Engineer_Modern_Weapons: "Reverse-Engineer Modern Weapons"
 SZC_Reverse_Engineer_Modern_Weapons_desc: "It'd be a waste to simply distribute the foreign equipment we have acquired to the troops. To make the most of it, we'll dispatch our brightest military engineers to reverse-engineer them so that we can produce our own, superior variants."

 SZC_Heavy_Firepower_Tactics: "Heavy Firepower Tactics"
 SZC_Heavy_Firepower_Tactics_desc: "It's clear that we need to double our efforts to produce qualified artillery officers, since many of them still use their batteries in the most rudimentary ways. When we're done reforming our training methods, our artillery will shake the earth itself with mighty barrages ahead of every offensive we launch!"

 SZC_Armament_Production_Innovations: "Armament Production Innovations"
 SZC_Armament_Production_Innovations_desc: "We cannot call our army truly modernised unless we develop our own modern arms. We'll pour more funds into our military R&D department so that they have the means to produce new weapons, made from the ground up by Chinese hands."

 SZC_The_Industrial_Army: "Accelerated Army Development"
 SZC_The_Industrial_Army_desc: "All our efforts to modernise have borne fruit. Our now mighty army has perfected the fusion of both military and industrial might to overwhelm any foe. Thanks to our industries, we can amass more guns, bullets, bombs and shells to use against our foes than anyone else in China. Let them tremble before the might of the Accelerated Army!"

 SZC_Republican_Triumph: "Republican Triumph"
 SZC_Republican_Triumph_desc: "Against all odds, the Officer Department has secured control over the provincial government. The two leaders, Xiong Kewu and Lü Chao, are preparing to consolidate their position and make Sichuan a bastion of republicanism and democracy."

 SZC_preparing_sichuan_for_federalism: "Preparing Sichuan for Federalism"
 SZC_preparing_sichuan_for_federalism_desc: "Although Xiong stands above all other warlords following the fall of Yang Sen, it would be a mistake to consider his control over Chuan to be absolute. Indeed, the minor warlords of Sichuan have often looked enviously towards the leader of the ensemble, and Xiong Kewu must ensure that his current time in the sun will not be ended prematurely, as it has before."

 SZC_establish_fundamental_laws: "Establish Fundamental Laws"
 SZC_establish_fundamental_laws_desc: "Sichuan finds itself in a particular dire situation, even relative to its bordering provinces. Decades of civil war within the province and invasions from its neighbours have left much of the province destitute and lawless, and the Xiong administration shall see such chaos cured with order brought about by a far-reaching series of legal reforms and regulations."

 SZC_observe_the_new_guard: "Observe the New Guard"
 SZC_observe_the_new_guard_desc: "In order to break Sichuan's cycle of warlord infighting, the old warlords must be rooted out, reform after reform. The New Sichuan requires officers who understand loyalty to the Xiong administration to be their patriotic duty, and they shall come to fill the ranks of the government over time, while old parasites find themselves retired from the halls of power."

 SZC_Our_Promise_to_the_Province: "Our Promise to the Province"
 SZC_Our_Promise_to_the_Province_desc: "While Xiong Kewu stands triumphant as Sichuan's governor, the people shall know his solemn promise to the province. Xiong's government seeks to ensure local government from the village will not be trampled upon by opportunistic militarists, the people will work together for a common good, and all classes shall see a new horizon in time."

 SZC_solicit_cooperation_between_north_and_south: "Solicit Cross-Regional Cooperation"
 SZC_solicit_cooperation_between_north_and_south_desc: "While the Federalist Movement has largely been a southern movement that protests Beijing's centralising tendencies, it must be known that it is not the destruction of the Beiyang Republic which we seek. No, it is our goal to redeem the Republic to be the pillar of hope it was always meant to be, freeing both North and South."

 SZC_construct_new_arsenals: "Construct New Arsenals"
 SZC_construct_new_arsenals_desc: "In this time of great chaos, it is not the pen which brings political power, but the barrel of a gun. While Fengtian wields the Shenyang Arsenal, Beijing can count on the Hanyang Arsenal on its side. If Sichuan is to earn the respect of the major warlords, Xiong must see Sichuan develop an Arsenal of its own."

 SZC_inter_allied_command: "Inter-Allied Command"
 SZC_inter_allied_command_desc: "Although the minor warlords respect Xiong's right to rule, they guard their own meagre forces zealously. If Sichuan is to become a respectable player in Chinese politics, all the officers of this province must stand together in a unified command structure. Let Sichuan's disunity be turned into a strength!"

 SZC_Legacy_of_the_Nation_Building_Allied_Army: "Legacy of the Nation Building Allied Army"
 SZC_Legacy_of_the_Nation_Building_Allied_Army_desc: "Perhaps the greatest Sichuanese army was the Nation-Building Allied Army, a mighty force led by Xiong in 1925. The province may yet find such heights of success once again, through Xiong's restoration of the Mobile Officer Training School. Once again shall this institution train Sichuan's finest officers, ones who may see the nation unified."

 SZC_Rule_of_the_Officers: "Rule of the Officers"
 SZC_Rule_of_the_Officers_desc: "In perhaps the greatest twist of all, the Officers under Li Jiayu and Luo Zezhuo have established themselves as the leaders of Sichuan Province. Obscure underdogs for their entire careers, Li and Luo have established a working relationship with Lü Chao's Industrial Corps, and together these three shall bring Sichuan into a new age."

 SZC_overlook_our_excesses: "Overlook Our Excesses"
 SZC_overlook_our_excesses_desc: "Even amidst our triumph, we must concede the fact that our forces are still relatively inexperienced compared to other provincial forces. One aspect that contributed to our victory was the presence of generals with experience gained from proper academy training or fighting with other armies. As such, it is appropriate that we give these veteran commanders some leeway, overlooking their less relevant attributes, whether they be addicts, unreasonable disciplinarians or both."

 SZC_court_the_young_soldiers_federation: "Court the Young Soldiers Federation"
 SZC_court_the_young_soldiers_federation_desc: "A minor faction within the Officer Corps coalition, the Young Soldiers Federation is a leftist and populist organisation calling for stronger benefits for soldiers. While the finer details of the movement escape Li, he recognises the benefits in endorsing such a platform for the Officers to promote in Sichuanese governance."

 SZC_no_demilitarisation_without_militarisation: "No Demilitarisation Without Militarisation"
 SZC_no_demilitarisation_without_militarisation_desc: "It is well known to all those under Heaven that Sichuan has toiled under the misfortunes of warlord infighting for decades. While demilitarisation is a dream sought by many, the Officers cannot enforce true demilitarisation while other warlords brandish their swords towards our government, for only the sword can bring peace."

 SZC_the_source_of_our_vigour: "The Source of Our Vigour"
 SZC_the_source_of_our_vigour_desc: "Caught between the various warlords who have subjugated them to ruthless exploitation, the peasantry found themselves greatly sympathetic to our meagre cause during the Zhili Decade. It was due to their support that the Officers were able to return to Sichuan in 1936, and the rural masses shall remain our lifeline!"

 SZC_repaying_the_countrys_kindness: "Repaying the Country's Kindness"
 SZC_repaying_the_countrys_kindness_desc: "Even in this tumultuous time, the common people have not forgotten the common virtue which binds us all. As Confucius called upon the state to be the vehicle of the principles and kindness of the people, so shall Li Jiayu's Sichuan stand to be a pillar of virtue in a sea of unjust warlords."

 SZC_for_the_national_cause: "For the National Cause"
 SZC_for_the_national_cause_desc: "While Sichuan may have found peace after decades of agonising warfare, the ancestral homeland continues to be defiled by oppressive warmongers. Sichuan stands for the cause of a better Republic, and Li Jiayu lends his blade to the liberation of all China from the yoke of tyranny and imperialism."

 SZC_centralise_tax_and_customs: "Centralise Tax and Customs"
 SZC_centralise_tax_and_customs_desc: "In Sichuan's time of disunity, various warlord fiefdoms began to enact drastically divergent policies, which has resulted in a bureaucratic mess for the Officer administration. The administration has begun working towards slashing the various superfluous regional taxes, and establishing a singular province-wide taxation system."

 SZC_connect_rural_townships: "Connect Rural Townships"
 SZC_connect_rural_townships_desc: "While the Sichuan basin is a comfortable lowland region that operates as our heartland, the farflung regions of Chuan host treacherous mountains and titanic river systems. To establish authority across the entire province, these rural townships must be reconnected to the basin network."

 SZC_raise_the_weary_help_the_weak: "Raise the Weary, Help the Weak"
 SZC_raise_the_weary_help_the_weak_desc: "Truly, the Sichuanese Civil War has brought about untold suffering on the people. Many families find themselves torn apart, and many more live in destitution and unjust squalor. The [ROOT.GetLeader] administration has made the top priority to assist the ailing populace in recovering from this tragic conflict between fellow Sichuanese."

 SZC_new_sichuans_14_points: "New Sichuan's 14 Points"
 SZC_new_sichuans_14_points_desc: "The New Sichuan has emerged from its decades of strife with newfound wisdom. The new progressive administration has outlined various points on how it shall approach governance of wartorn Chuan, covering economic matters, military concerns, modernisation, foreign outlook, and relations to the other provinces. Sichuan turns a new leaf today!"

 SZC_modernisation_through_rail_and_road: "Modernisation through Rail and Road"
 SZC_modernisation_through_rail_and_road_desc: "In the West, impressive railroads bring interconnectedness to all regions in a nation. If China is to catch up to the might of Europe, then it must first emulate Western infrastructure. Railroads shall become the new lifeblood of the Chinese nation, and the match to set the fire shall begin here in Sichuan!"

 SZC_control_arms_manufacturing: "Control Arms Manufacturing"
 SZC_control_arms_manufacturing_desc: "While the province-wide truce has held on for this long, a disruption in the balance of power could break the delicate house of cards. If Sichuan is to remain at peace, the minor warlords must not be allowed to acquire more weapons into their arsenals, while the Officers must maintain their military supremacy."

 SZC_standardise_troop_numbers: "Standardise Troop Numbers"
 SZC_standardise_troop_numbers_desc: "In an effort to outcompete one another, the various Sichuan warlords raised their armies to massive sizes at exorbitant cost. The bloated Sichuanese army has only brought about trouble for the current administration, so the Governor has declared it necessary to greatly downsize the military. Such an effort shall hopefully also curb the powers of other Sichuan warlords."

 SZC_repeal_the_warlord_taxes: "Repeal The Warlord Taxes"
 SZC_repeal_the_warlord_taxes_desc: "With many minor warlords rejecting the leaders of Chengdu and Chongqing, they could only hope to finance their tiny administrations with massive taxes upon the local populace. Such excessiveness has resulted in a spike of poverty, and [ROOT.GetLeader] shall eliminate all such taxes now that the province recognises a single polity."

 SZC_unify_provincial_currency: "Unify Provincial Currency"
 SZC_unify_provincial_currency_desc: "The various warlords in an effort to establish regionalist autonomies attempted to develop their own currency system separate from the provincial government. This has left many regions more politically divided from [ROOT.GetLeader]'s administration than expected. These regional currencies shall be removed, and the whole province shall utilise a singular monetary system."

 SZC_an_end_to_the_arbitrary: "An End to the Arbitrary"
 SZC_an_end_to_the_arbitrary_desc: "Throughout the province, abuses are commonplace. Landlords exact extortionate rent on tenants, effectively taking all harvests from the producing classes. Such barbarities shall not be tolerated in the New Sichuan, and [ROOT.GetLeader] has seen fit to establish various rent caps across all of Sichuan."

 SZC_the_independence_of_educational_funding: "Independence of Education Funding"
 SZC_the_independence_of_educational_funding_desc: "The previous Sichuan administration had to rely greatly upon Beijing's financial support in order to maintain various educational institutions. In events where the Central Government found itself in great turmoil, Sichuan's schools would cease to function. The province must rely on local sponsors to maintain education in the province instead."

 SZC_solving_the_trade_issue: "On the Issue of Trade"
 SZC_solving_the_trade_issue_desc: "In order to resuscitate the ailing Sichuanese economy, interregional trade must be restored to previous heights. The province has found itself the breadbasket of the nation, and Shu's agricultural yield shall surely bolster the financial state of the province. With the famine subsiding and our rice and grain stores restored, Sichuan's exports shall resume in full."

 SZC_limit_military_meddling: "Limit Military Meddling"
 SZC_limit_military_meddling_desc: "While the New Sichuanese Administration was established in part due to force of arms, the Sichuan Provincial Government shall not be operated like some Guangxi stratocracy. Civilian and military authorities must be divided, and the military must be discouraged from being used as a cudgel to enforce laws."

 SZC_create_the_sichuan_central_mint: "Create the Sichuan Central Mint"
 SZC_create_the_sichuan_central_mint_desc: "In a modern economy, financial institutions and banks have a large role to play. If enterprising businessmen find themselves in need of a loan, the Sichuan Central Mint shall give them all the money needed. This bank will be the new centre of finance in Southern China, and shall be the model of the nation hereafter!"

 SZC_putting_the_nail_in_banditry: "Putting the Nail in Banditry"
 SZC_putting_the_nail_in_banditry_desc: "With much of the province in utter poverty, many have resorted to banditry to get by. These wretches have proven to be a thorn in the side of Sichuan's future stability and must be culled immediately, now that the province finally finds itself in political stability. Let it be known that Shu gives this Guangxi tradition the respect it deserves, none."

 SZC_evaluating_government_finances: "Evaluating Government Finances"
 SZC_evaluating_government_finances_desc: "If the Sichuanese Government is to embark upon a campaign to unify the Chinese nation under the Federalist flag, Xiong must ensure that Chongqing's financial position can support such a lofty goal. All previous goals of the administration must become secondary towards the new goal of National Reconstruction. While this may lead Sichuan back upon a path of war, when the ancestors call upon all Yan Huang Zisun to liberate the realm, we answer."

 SZC_taking_stock_of_the_military: "Taking Stock of the Military"
 SZC_taking_stock_of_the_military_desc: "At present, Xiong Kewu's 9 Man Regiment stands as Sichuan's strongest military force. Many of the minor warlords present meagre armies that are capable only of suppressing rowdy peasants. In the spirit of the Nation-Building Allied Army, Xiong Kewu must construct a new Federalist military out of this motley assortment of warlord forces that can stand against the major warlords of China."

 SZC_government_of_national_reconstruction: "Government of National Reconstruction"
 SZC_government_of_national_reconstruction_desc: "As more and more democrats and rump federalist federalist armies stumble into Sichuan Province, Xiong has found it prudent to call a Federalist Convention in Chongqing to establish a New Federalist Government that shall represent the cause of Free China. This new National Reconstruction Government must be able to stand against both inside and outward pressures, or Xiong's dreams shall never be realised."

 SZC_beyond_the_red_river_basin: "Beyond the Red River Basin"
 SZC_beyond_the_red_river_basin_desc: "For much of the Republican Era, Sichuan has found itself beset by invasions by its neighbours for opportunistic and petty gain. Our neighbours attempted to prey upon our disunity and play brother against brother. Now, it is Sichuan that stands united and ready to save all of China. While our neighbours sought to tear us apart, the National Reconstruction Government seeks only to save our fellow Chinese."

 SZC_export_militarism_avenged: "Export Militarism Avenged"
 SZC_export_militarism_avenged_desc: "After the National Protection War, the Yunnan Clique attempted to establish dominance over Sichuan after assisting us in defeating the Beiyang Clique. Under their doctrine of export militarism, the Yunnanese warlords consistently intervened beyond its borders in order to secure critical resources. It is high time Kunming was punished for its internal-imperialism and the Dian people freed from oppression."

 SZC_the_warpath_towards_canton: "Warpath Towards Canton"
 SZC_the_warpath_towards_canton_desc: "During the Warlord Era, the primary struggle could be considered one between the Beijing and Guangzhou Governments. While the Beijing Government established dominance following the fall of the Kuomintang, the lofty ideals of the Guangzhou Government live still with us. If the National Reconstruction Government could seize Guangdong, such a victory would give our government much needed legitimacy."

 SZC_descending_upon_the_central_plains: "Descending Upon the Central Plains"
 SZC_descending_upon_the_central_plains_desc: "The ancestral heartland of all Chinese, Zhongyuan was the birthplace of Chinese civilisation. While the Xinhai Revolution began in Wuchang, the revolution was unable to sweep across the rest of the Central Plains due to Beiyang militarist suppression. The National Reconstruction Government will see the Federalist Movement stretch further north than ever before!"

 SZC_the_treasures_of_huadong: "The Treasures of Huadong"
 SZC_the_treasures_of_huadong_desc: "Eastern China has long been the economic heart of the Chinese nation. Jiangsu and Zhejiang have always been centres of trade, but the development of Shanghai during the 1800s has seen it turn into the financial centre of the East. Liberating Eastern China would allow the National Reconstruction Government to secure Shanghai finances and ensure our future military campaigns will be properly funded."

 SZC_strike_north_of_the_great_wall: "Strike North of the Great Wall"
 SZC_strike_north_of_the_great_wall_desc: "North of Beijing lies perhaps our most dangerous foe, the Fengtian Clique. Hiding behind the Great Wall and aided by the Japanese imperialists, they wield China's most industrial region and seek to extinguish any light of freedom in China. In order to destroy the taint of the Beiyang warlords forever, the Northeastern Provinces must be secured by the National Reconstruction Government."

 SZC_no_preparation_too_rigorous: "No Preparation Too Rigorous"
 SZC_no_preparation_too_rigorous_desc: "In our campaign to reunify China, it is likely we will come to blows with our imperialist neighbour, the Empire of Japan. For decades, Tokyo has preyed upon our ailing country, hoping to extract as many resources in the name of so-called \"Pan-Asian unity.\" While our government may hope to contend with the Japanese on the mainland, the Japanese control the seas. When the Japanese descend from the seas, we must be ready to force them back to their ships."

 SZC_to_be_inspired_not_conquered: "To Be Inspired, Not Conquered"
 SZC_to_be_inspired_not_conquered_desc: "As we find ourselves in a War of Resistance against the Japanese invaders, let us not fall to despair. Chinese civilisation spans five thousand years of rich history, and the upstarts in Tokyo foolishly deign themselves our superiors. Let us struggle for our nation's survival against this unjust foe, let all soldiers of the Chinese military shatter the Japanese Empire here and now!"

 SZC_chinese_determination_unshaken: "Chinese Determination, Unshaken"
 SZC_chinese_determination_unshaken_desc: "As this war for survival unfolds, we enter into a new type of war. This total war shall require the full energies of the Chinese masses as we struggle as one against the Japanese war machine. While Japanese morale crumbles with every mounting struggle between the two powers of East Asia, the resolve of the Chinese people only grows stronger. Victory or death against the Empire of Japan!"

 SZC_lessons_of_the_nanchong_charter: "Lessons of the Nanchong Charter"
 SZC_lessons_of_the_nanchong_charter_desc: "Drafted in 1921 following months of discussion between Zhang Lan and his fellow Federalist allies, most important of which being Xiong Kewu, the Nanchong Charter was the first local piece of legislation to set forward grassroots democracy in the Sichuan basin; with many other progressive reforms in tow. We would be wise to learn from its successes, and its failures."

 SZC_the_seeds_of_democracy: "The Seeds of Democracy"
 SZC_the_seeds_of_democracy_desc: "Only a short few years ago, the Federalist Movement was confined to the trappings of Sichuan Province. Today, our National Reconstruction Government flies the Five Colour Flag in Beijing, the capital of our nation. While much of the nation has fallen into our hands, the struggle has only begun. Military unification has only brought us to the front door of reform, and now democratisation efforts must begin to take shape here in the Imperial Capital."

 SZC_local_community_politics: "Local Community Politics"
 SZC_local_community_politics_desc: "Chinese democracy does not begin in the centres of power in Beijing. No, it begins from the grassroots, from the village level. The most basic level of organisation across the nation, these self-governing villages led by village elders shall be the blueprint for a new Chinese democracy. Under Zhang Lan's leadership, China will finally know a government of the people, by the people, and for the people."

 SZC_compromise_with_the_gentry: "Compromise with the Gentry"
 SZC_compromise_with_the_gentry_desc: "While the Gentry have gained something of a negative reputation across China, especially amongst the lower classes, they will have a crucial role to play in the new China. China's educated have often sprung from the gentry class, and the support of the landed establishment shall keep our finances satiated. If China is to be freed, it will require proper governance spearheaded by its smartest."

 SZC_curb_provincial_vices: "Curb Provincial Vices"
 SZC_curb_provincial_vices_desc: "The disease of Opium took root in our province during the Century of Humiliation. Bringing us to the knees, this drug has all but destroyed the spirit of the Chinese people. Although opportunistic warlords have relied upon the cultivation of Opium poppies to finance their militaries, our Government must break this filth in order to be regarded as a government that stands to undo historical injustices."

 SZC_the_fruits_of_education: "The Fruits of Education"
 SZC_the_fruits_of_education_desc: "Truly, no democracy can take shape in an illiterate nation. Much of our population cannot hope to vote without the ability to read and write their opinions. Thus, education shall become paramount in our development of Chinese democracy. As the people learn Chinese values and the functions of a democratic government, citizen participation shall continually increase until our Republic stands as tall as Western powers."

 SZC_freedom_of_thought_and_academics: "Freedom of Thought and Academics"
 SZC_freedom_of_thought_and_academics_desc: "Acting as the vanguard of progressive thought in China, universities and intellectuals have often voiced their vision for Chinese political reform only to be put down by reactionary militarists. In the New China, such expression of political thought shall be encouraged, as Chinese society becomes as innovative as the days of the Chinese Golden Age!"

 SZC_expand_chongqing_university: "Expand Chongqing University"
 SZC_expand_chongqing_university_desc: "In the preceding years, Chongqing has become the beating heart of Free China. As more and more intellectuals find China an increasingly hostile environment and flee to the sanctuary of the National Reconstruction Government, the Chongqing University has found itself overstaffed. Chongqing University shall reflect the new size of its staff, and lead the way for free universities across China."

 SZC_exercise_in_industrial_autonomy: "Exercise in Industrial Autonomy"
 SZC_exercise_in_industrial_autonomy_desc: "While much of China has stamped upon the rights of businessmen and merchants, Zhang Lan and the National Reconstruction Government hope to try a different approach. Industrialists shall be given a level of autonomy from the Federal Government in order to foster friendly business relations, but they too must follow the red lines of the President Zhang Lan or see their privileges revoked."

 SZC_integration_of_labour_and_learning: "Integration of Labour and Learning"
 SZC_integration_of_labour_and_learning_desc: "Truly, the Federalist Movement represents the concern of the Working Class better than anyone else. While the Beiyang warlords would crush them with an iron fist and the Kuomintang would ensnare them in their so-called National Revolution, it is the National Reconstruction Government which seeks to give them legal protections as well as education. Often illiterate, schooling for the working class would assist them in understanding and defending their rights."

 SZC_revitalise_local_enterprise: "Revitalise Local Enterprise"
 SZC_revitalise_local_enterprise_desc: "The Chinese Civil War has seen many progressive reforms both in Sichuan and other provinces disrupted by armed conflict and chaos. The National Reconstruction Government, not content to reign over a nation of dust and ash, has seen to it that businesses and enterprises in war-torn regions and rural hinterland be supported, and hopefully begin to recover even while other provinces continue to engage in high level fighting."

 SZC_the_professional_associations_system: "The Professional Associations System"
 SZC_the_professional_associations_system_desc: "As proposed by Zhang Junmai of the Democratic Socialist Party, the National Reconstruction Government ought to represent Chinese people of all classes. Critical professions to national interests must be supported, and associations formed to organise them. Through these organisations, the Federal Government and these classes can collaborate for mutual benefit."

 SZC_abolish_tax_pre_collection: "Abolish Tax Pre-Collection"
 SZC_abolish_tax_pre_collection_desc: "Tax Pre-Collection is a policy that allows lenders to prematurely close accounts from borrowers who are unexpected to pay off their debt, and see their debt sold to a collection agency. A predatory policy that harms the working class of China, this abominable practice will be excised from China's shores, hopefully never to return."

 SZC_a_new_unified_currency: "A New Unified Currency"
 SZC_a_new_unified_currency_desc: "With political divides in China lasting decades, the various rival governments have begun to issue differing currency in their respective borders. With many of these governments militarily defeated by the Federal Military, it has left the President with the mess of sorting through these various currencies. With support from the National Assembly, President [ROOT.GetLeader] has offered the people of China to hand in their invalid currencies to exchange with our currency."

 SZC_rally_the_intelligentsia: "Rally the Intelligentsia"
 SZC_rally_the_intelligentsia_desc: "With various intellectuals finding themselves in Sichuan, frictions have emerged between the fractious groups. Zhang Junmai has continually attempted to assert himself as a leading force in the Federal Government, and a splintering of lines between the Grand Republican Alliance and China Democratic League has left many disgruntled. However, if our movement is to survive, we must continue to sustain the unity of the early government which brought us success."

 SZC_creating_a_provisional_capital: "Creating a Provisional Capital"
 SZC_creating_a_provisional_capital_desc: "With more and more of China's major cities falling to the military forces of the Federal Republic, it has become more pressing to establish a better Provisional Capital for our National Reconstruction Government. Chongqing, having served its purpose, is not necessarily the best place from which to govern the newly conquered provinces, and while Beijing is the traditional centre of government, some believe a change is needed."

 SZC_combatting_the_root_of_apathy: "Combatting the Root of Apathy"
 SZC_combatting_the_root_of_apathy_desc: "When the Republic of China was first established, a rush of idealism struck the nation. However, years of warlord fighting and foreign exploitation has left the spirit of the Chinese people woefully apathetic to political changes. If a democracy is to take root in the Middle Kingdom, economic and political reforms must be undertaken to jolt the Chinese people out of passivity."

 SZC_overtures_to_student_radicals: "Overtures to Student Radicals"
 SZC_overtures_to_student_radicals_desc: "With the allure of socialism has become more and more attractive to idealistic student groups, there has been a growing number of radical student groups operating from the major universities within the National Reconstruction Government. Protesting working conditions, these groups demand the government do more. Perhaps hoping to turn them into a pillar of support, President [ROOT.GetLeader] has offered some concessions to these groups and a United Front."

 SZC_agreements_with_the_ycp: "Agreements with the YCP"
 SZC_agreements_with_the_ycp_desc: "A titanic mass movement entrenched in Sichuan and the Central Plains, the Young China Party is a nationalist force spread across military and intellectual circles. Although the fall of the Zhili Clique has crippled their movement, they remain a viable force in mass party politics. Well acquainted with their leadership, President [ROOT.GetLeader] has invited them to the government."

 SZC_promoting_harmonious_bipartisanship: "Promoting Harmonious Bipartisanship"
 SZC_promoting_harmonious_bipartisanship_desc: "Although the election certainly saw tensions between the China Democratic League and Grand Republican Alliance flare, President Dan hopes to repair tensions between Xiong Kewu and Zhang Lan. While the China Democratic League is the main opposition party, both the GRA and CDL do hope for largely the same vision for China, and collaboration between the two parties will surely be in China's interest."

 SZC_the_safeguard_against_autocracy: "The Safeguard against Autocracy"
 SZC_the_safeguard_against_autocracy_desc: "While the military has traditionally been a force for warlordism, the Federal military stands unique across all Chinese armies. The Jianguojun, like the political leadership of the National Reconstruction Government, fights for the democratic cause, and can be trusted to intervene if the President ever slips into tyranny. The people of China can rest easy knowing that even if the government forgets its commitments to democracy, Liu Wenhui will not."

 SZC_building_a_fair_cabinet: "Building a Fair Cabinet"
 SZC_building_a_fair_cabinet_desc: "As our National Reconstruction Government incorporates more territories and parties, it is only fair that our administration evolves along with the nation. In order to maintain the unity that saw the Federal Government rise to become the main government of China, the President's cabinet shall include representation from the major parties participating in the government, as well as qualified technocrats from professional associations."

 SZC_parameters_of_the_legislature: "Parameters of the Legislature"

 SZC_reviving_the_chinese_democratic_process_desc: "While China has never officially strayed from democracy after 1912, it was rendered largely out of the equation following the cancellation of elections in 1933. As our Government of National Reconstruction marches forward, President [ROOT.GetLeader] strives to revive these antiquated institutions which were so frequently abused, and improve upon the minuscule reforms made by the Beiyang warlords."

 SZC_increase_troop_funding_desc: "If the National Reconstruction Government hopes to lead unification of the Chinese nation, we must see to it that the army is sufficiently bolstered. While the Jianguojun still exhibits a concerning level of warlordism and factionalism, President Zhang and Premier Xiong have no choice but to embark on this course of action, or the Federal Movement will die in Sichuan."

 SZC_recruit_sympathetic_officers_desc: "While Yang Sen, Liu Cunhou, and Liu Xiang were opportunistic warlords who fought for their own petty interests, a small number of their subordinates either rose up due to meritorious service or were sympathetic to our cause. These officers may help form a new loyalist bloc within the Jianguojun, and help root out particularly egregious warlords within our ranks."

 SZC_reach_out_to_the_baoding_department: "Reach out to the Baoding Department"
 SZC_reach_out_to_the_baoding_department_desc: "As the Baoding Department was not aligned with the Officers or 9 Man Regiment when Yang Sen and Liu Xiang fell from power, the triumvirate suffered a major setback in power from Xiong's elevation to the Governorship. Liu Wenhui for his part has already opted to support Xiong, but Deng Xihou and Tian Songyao have remained both out of government and out of power. Due to Liu's prodding, Xiong has reluctantly invited the other Baoding warlords to the table."

 SZC_renovate_arsenal_capacities: "Renovate Arsenal Capacities"
 SZC_renovate_arsenal_capacities_desc: "While minor arsenals have allowed Sichuanese warlords to remain a regional power in China, they are not sufficient for the National Reconstruction Government to launch a military campaign for total reunification. No, Sichuan's minor military arsenals must be improved upon substantially in order to feed the Federalist Jianguojun's war effort in the coming Chinese Civil War."

 SZC_root_out_incompetence_and_ineptitude: "Root Out Incompetence and Ineptitude"
 SZC_root_out_incompetence_and_ineptitude_desc: "As the Jianguojun's initial ranks encompass all warlord forces within the province, the quality of the Federalist military is unenviably inconsistent. While Xiong's personal forces rank as the army's elite, minor warlords that have operated more like bandits are barely equipped and untrained for real warfare. If the Jianguojun is to become a real force, Xiong must see to it that unskilled bandits and corrupt officers are removed and replaced with meritorious replacements."

 SZC_era_illuminated_by_sacrifice_desc: "In this time of chaos, heroes and villains have risen and fallen as circumstances change. The great Cai E fought to depose the autocrat Yuan Shikai's imperial regime, even as his own health faded away. Many more have followed in his example, truly heroes in the image of Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang. If the Federalist Democratic Revolution is to succeed, many more sacrifices will likely be made on the path to unification, and the Republic will honour them all when the dust settles."

 SZC_restoring_naval_projection_desc: "During the Ming Dynasty, China sported the greatest navy in the world. The Late Qing attempted to emulate Ming successes as well as modern innovations through the Beiyang Navy, but it met an ill-fated end when faced against the Imperial Japanese Navy. With our National Reconstruction Government ascendant, it falls upon us to restore Chinese pride on the seas, and once again dominate the waters of Asia."

 SZC_soaring_in_free_skies_desc: "As the modern age of warfare progresses, it has become apparent that the airforce shall play an integral role. The Federal Government previously relied on pure infantry forces in order in its military unification campaigns, but as our government begins to fight more modern forces in Northern China and neighbouring powers, developing a modern airforce has become paramount to the Federalist war effort."

 SZC_the_last_bastion_of_federalism_desc: "While Sichuan was still in the midst of civil war, the provinces of Zhejiang and Hunan had already promulgated their own provincial constitutions. However, in a cruel twist of irony, it seems that Sichuan has emerged from its civil war only to find all other Federalist provinces in the thrall of tyrants. Now Xiong Kewu stands as the final leading federalist, and he will not squander his moment on the national stage."

 SZC_the_vibrant_bipartisan_democracy_desc: "While Zhang Lan was the face of our National Reconstruction Government during the Chinese Civil War, it was Xiong Kewu and Dan Maoxin who led the Jianguojun to ultimate victory. Recognised as the swords of liberty, the Chinese people have resoundingly backed Dan Maoxin and Xiong Kewu to be the new leaders of our Federal Republic. While the CDL has emerged as our political rivals, we welcome this as a sign of a burgeoning bipartisan republic."

 SZC_a_forum_for_the_level_headed_desc: "Chinese Governance has long seen itself abused by personalism, idealogues, and demagoguery; those tokens of the irrational and intolerable. But a healthy democracy must let itself be lead by debate and discussion; words and law over rifle and shell. To this end, the government must enforce fair compliance in the organs of the Republic, so as to enable true Republicanism to flourish."

 SZC_enshrine_provincial_constitutions: "Enshrine Provincial Constitutions"
 SZC_enshrine_provincial_constitutions_desc: "The Local Self-Governance project sought to rectify China's national problems of inefficiency, and inability to rule its large domain. By taking the merits of the system of the United States, or of Germany, it would see itself free of the litany of problems of despotism at its political centre. Accommodating for the role of the Central Government, let us enshrine the province as the building block of the new China."

 SZC_encourage_local_initiative_desc: "Any form of centrally planned economic management is sure to wound up in disaster; and beyond the grand aspirations for socialism, or utopia, the nation itself still remains largely feudal in various areas. To enable further economic development in this time of great healing, the government shall provide for local entrepreneurial endeavours. For salvation of the nation may only emerge through industrialisation."

 SZC_national_demobilisation: "National Demobilisation"
 SZC_national_demobilisation_desc: "The Warlord Era's profane enabling of local military commanders to both amass significant wealth and a disparate band of soldiers has contributed greatly to the nation's inability to reject foreign imperialism, or otherwise recover since the Xinhai Revolution. Whilst Wu Peifu attempted National Demobilisation and failed, the new Republic carries with it a vigour that is utterly unrelenting in the persecution of warlordism."

 SZC_cooperate_with_regional_notables_desc: "The government cannot hope to enforce its will upon all citizenry in equal standing, and thus it is in desperate need of local allies. Men who, having committed no clear acts of treason, could be solicited to provide local outreach efforts within regions that otherwise remain aloof of the Capital. Be they local peasant leader, gentry, or businessman, all must come together for the betterment of the nation."

 SZC_the_great_beiyang_reapproachement_desc: "The opposition would see to it that a great array of skilled bureaucrats, politicians, and magistrates be cast aside for they are \"tainted\" by their previous tenures in office. However, that would be a sore mistake; for if the nation is to come together, it must acknowledge and be receptive towards the inroads that its previous attempts at Republicanism had made. Surely, amnesty is an offer none can refuse."

 SZC_depoliticise_the_ranks_desc: "Politics and personnel waltzing hand-in-hand has resulted in some of the nation's most recent tragedies. The machinations of Yuan Shikai, the despotism of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and his National Revolutionary Army, or that of the Zhili, Fengtian, or Anhui. The army is not the path for careerism and self-actualisation of idealogical goals, but for that of duty, honour, and service."

 SZC_bicameral_democracy_realised_desc: "China's Democracy, its previous attempts, that is, have long held themselves to the ideals built upon a bicameral legislature: the Assembly, and the Senate. With the latter having acting powers to effectively check both the cabinet and the Assembly, it has proven itself utterly incapable. With a renewed martial legalism in government, the very institutions of the Republic have received newfound primacy."

 SZC_from_resistance_to_reconstruction_desc: "Against all odds Zhang Lan has secured electoral victory, thwarting upstarts within the China Democratic League and handily defeating Dan Maoxin's Grand Republican Alliance. Considered a radical by reactionary elements, President Zhang finds opposition from many elements of Chinese society. An idealistic socialist with a heart of gold, President Zhang stands ready to enact his ambitious and radical plan for reconstructing the Chinese Republic, one reform at a time."

Our path to the modern world will certainly be unique to China, and we must strive to balance what we learn from the West with our own culture. China was once the greatest empire in the world, and in combining the lessons of the past and those of the present, we may reach for the skies."

 SZC_mobilising_the_broadest_masses_desc: "While the Intellectual class of China have historically been the vanguard of Chinese culture and political development, we must not forget the agrarian masses. Throughout Chinese history, the peasantry have toiled under arbitrary warlords and tyrannical emperors, and the President empathises with their struggle. No longer shall society's betters oppress the nation's bedrock, for we are only as great as our poorest social classes."

 SZC_the_gathering_of_many_minds: "The Gathering Of Many Minds"
 SZC_the_gathering_of_many_minds_desc: "An important trait to a stable democracy is learning to rule through consensus. As such, President Zhang Lan has called a conference of China's most prestigious and respected intellectuals to advise him on vital policy matters, even inviting his political rival Zhang Junmai to participate in the name of easing tensions. In bringing together many bright minds, the President is confident that many solutions to China's most pressing concerns shall be put forward."

 SZC_form_substance_and_spirit_desc: "A common criticism of Zhang Lan and other progressive intellectuals is that they lack understanding of the common folk and provide no practical solutions to economic and social problems beyond a vague call for further democratic reform. Fully aware of his critics, President Zhang Lan plans on demonstrating to the people the practicality of his national reconstruction plan through meaningful economic development and financial stabilisation."

 SZC_rebirth_of_the_political_animal: "Rebirth Of The Political Animal"
 SZC_rebirth_of_the_political_animal_desc: "After the Republic was declared, the intellectual classes hoped to represent the nation as its leading political class. However, Chinese intellectuals would find warlords and militarists sitting on the Republican throne. Forced to compromise under such circumstances, the civilian political class would find difficulty in pushing meaningful reform. With the military no longer the guiding hand of the Republic, the civilian political class may finally bring change through the pen."

 SZC_professionalize_the_soldierly_class: "Professionalize The Soldierly Class"
 SZC_professionalize_the_soldierly_class_desc: "While the Jianguojun was instrumental in bringing about the new Federal Republic, we must acknowledge it to be a desperate assortment of Sichuan's various warlords. With the nation finally at peace, the Chinese military must be restructured to make it into a proper military force, rather than a bloated mess of provincial forces and bandits. While Xiong Kewu and his allies may grumble, the new Republic is not guided by the blade."

 SZC_rein_in_army_cliques_desc: "Throughout the Republic's history, military cliques have traditionally been a leading force in influencing the nation's political direction either through the sword or behind closed doors. Hoping to put such undemocratic circles in China's past, President Zhang Lan plans to take on these military factions directly and see them eliminated once and for all. Let it be known that anti-democratic behaviour will no longer be tolerated!"

 SZC_nationwide_industrial_autonomy: "Nationwide Industrial Autonomy"
 SZC_nationwide_industrial_autonomy_desc: "In a country as large as China, it would be absurd to expect the Central Government to properly accommodate regions to their economic needs efficiently. President Zhang Lan has instead opted to allow the provinces to loosen their reins on economic policy, so that local businesses may thrive without unnecessary oversight. A nation that develops naturally is a nation that develops healthily."

 SZC_democracy_as_the_key: "Democracy As The Key"
 SZC_democracy_as_the_key_desc: "Our Republic was not always dominated by military strongmen. During the dream of 1912, the people of China eagerly participated in the first free election in the nation's history. However, Song Jiaoren's assassination would turn our dream into an unending nightmare, with warlords supplanting warlords day after day. Now, President Zhang Lan has finally wrangled the beast of militarism back into its cage, and the Republic may finally live up to the Dream of 1912."

Without quarter, Civil Governance will be restored, and Progress shall be achieved."

 SZC_societys_proper_placements_desc: "Once former politicians and warlords have nothing to do, they will simply stir up trouble in society, criticise this and that and obstruct government order. But once given work in productive developments, even if it's just a small responsibility, their disruptive influence will be greatly reduced. Let every Chinese citizen know their proper place in a productive society, one ruled by modernity, and not ideology."

 SZC_legacy_of_the_academy: "Legacy Of The Academy"
 SZC_legacy_of_the_academy_desc: "The Baoding Military Academy is perhaps China's greatest military institution. Having tutored some of the nation's greatest strategists and tacticians, it is a prized institution that has been treated utterly unfairly for its stature. The glories of its alumni are many, and through additional funding directed at Baoding, it may but achieve even greater heights in future wars."

 SZC_enshrine_military_primogeniture: "Enshrine Military Primogeniture"
 SZC_enshrine_military_primogeniture_desc: "China's military is both its greatest enemy, and its strongest vanguard. Whilst a crippling weakness if not properly parleyed with, the nation is in the hands of its strongest military forces; and thus their rights must be assured and protected. Whilst President Liu may be disgruntled at the notion of pervasive military influence in civilian governance, it is the nature of the beast that he has saddled himself with."

Thus arrives the new productive society!"

 SZC_the_push_for_efficiency: "The Push for Efficiency"
 SZC_the_push_for_efficiency_desc: "Chinese governance has long sought to enrich its benefactors through flagrant abuses of taxation, and of bureaucracy. By merging redundant departments, eliminating government agencies deemed to be useless, and the filtering of capital from useless places to areas that desperately need the funding, China's industrialisation will accelerate in unbridled ferocity."

Yet, through the skilled development programs of Liu Wenhui, Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, and all others of the Baoding Department, they have grown into industrial powerhouses!

Instead choosing loyalty towards the disloyal and perfidious, they have refused tacitly, or otherwise protested, the current government. Such blatant inefficiencies cannot be tolerated, and it is imperative that the government forcefully streamline internal administrations - to its own ends."

 SZC_a_nation_not_only_of_critics: "A Nation not only of Critics"
 SZC_a_nation_not_only_of_critics_desc: "There is no time for idealist dribble! The nation must be developed industrially! The masses are hungry, they lack productive employment, they lack even the money to sufficiently clothe themselves. The nation needs workers and producing classes, not intellectuals and critics of the downtrodden nation. Whatever avenues for dialogue are present, they can wait until the nation is even capable of standing on its own two feet."

Through systematic development, the next century may very well be the Chinese one."

 SZC_to_seek_prosperity: "To Seek Prosperity"
 SZC_to_seek_prosperity_desc: "Money is the root of all evil, as they say, but the government must work to dismiss the social attitude that money is intrinsically linked to petty warlords, conniving businessmen, and crooked officials!

 SZC_new_style_education: "New Style Education"
 SZC_new_style_education_desc: "Education must be of that for the everyman; it must serve as a baseline for life itself. Thus, the government must place due prioritisation of financing the Ministry of Education, and draw out within the Chinese youth their own potential for future generations. Those ivory tower intellectuals yearn to prioritise the universities, but how can a university function without fundamental education before it?"

 SZC_a_reliable_national_constabulary: "A Reliable National Constabulary"
 SZC_a_reliable_national_constabulary_desc: "The last few decades of Chinese societal experiences have proven themselves to be evident in one thing: when the nation experiences disorder, bandits, petty criminals, and thieves run amok. And with the military predisposed towards national defence rather than internal policing, there is but one solution. Following the lead of cadets educated in America under August Vollmer, China must revolutionise its policing."

It can be utilised for any means; to achieve power, to achieve change, or to achieve success. With altruistic applications and self-servicing ones, those with the most knowledge reign supreme over those without; thus the question is raised, what is the true purpose of knowledge? For higher office and political power? Or the advancement of China?"

 SZC_to_cultivate_talent: "To Cultivate Talent"

Furthermore, even more schools must be opened in all places; for no child within the nation should have to traverse life without experiencing the liberating light of education.

As much as the animosity between Marshal Wang and Marshal Wu tore them apart, at the end of the day they still had a duty to do. Wu served to the end, fulfilling his duty. No doubt attempting to defend Cao from hails of bullets. Similarly, Marshal Wang and the rest of the Zhili Army must march forever onwards. For their memory, at the very least."

 SZC_country_intro_content: "As 1936 dawns, §aSichuan§! remains in a very fragile balance between its multiple factions. §aYang Sen§! holds for now, buoyed by §PZhili§! support from his personal backer, the §PJade Marshal Wu Peifu§! and aided by his close associate and former governor of §aSichuan§!, §PLiu Cunhou§!, whose status and connections, as well as considerable forces, give §aYang§! sorely needed stability and legitimacy. However, the military disasters of the past decade led §aYang Sen§! to rely on the cliques led by §cDeng Xihou§! and §PLiu Xiang§!, who now hold considerable influence in the government and in Sichuan itself. The remnants of the §RKMT-aligned§! §SOfficer Department§! still control parts of southern §aSichuan§!, though the years since have seen their area of control steadily diminish.\n\n§aSichuan§! stands at the edge of a knife, internally divided, with multiple factions vying for ultimate power in the province. It may take only the slightest sign of weakness in the §PZhili§! for this powderkeg to blow up..."

 SZC_country_intro_header_1: "The §aSichuan Clique§!"
 SZC_country_intro_content_1: "The modern history of §aSichuan§! begins in 1912. When the §lXinhai Revolution§! reached §aSichuan§!, the region entered a period of prolonged instability, with regional warlords vying for the governorship by diplomacy and force. Between 1912 and 1926, the region was alternatively controlled by §lXinhai revolutionaries§!, §RKuomintang loyalists§! and §Plocal warlords§!.\n\nThis state of affairs would last until the failure of the Northern Expedition in 1926. With the personal support of the victorious §PZhili§! leader, §cWu Peifu§!, §aYang Sen§! was able to establish himself as the firm ruler of §aSichuan§!, finally restoring some semblance of stability to the region. However, the profound divisions within §aSichuan would§! not disappear, with §aYang§! rapidly becoming beheld to the interests for various internal cliques that formed and unable to remove their influence. §PLiu Xiang§!, one of these warlords, established himself in §PChongqing§! by allying himself with the local administration, quickly becoming §aYang's§! main rival for control over §aSichuan§!.\n\n1928 saw §aSichuan§! face an invasion from the neighbouring clique of §aYunnan§!. While at first a success, the invasion was soon defeated by §aSichuanese§! forces, causing considerable losses among §aYang's§! personal forces. A §PTibetan§! invasion in 1930 deteriorated the situation even further, with §PTibetan§! troops reaching the Yangtze River and directly threatening the capital of §aChengdu§!. While the involvement of the §PMa Clique§! to the north eventually turned the tide against the §PTibetans§!, §aSichuan§! was forced to cede half of the §aXikang§! region to §PTibet§! and §aYang's§! military was left in tatters."

 SZC_country_intro_header_2: "The §aSichuan Clique§! (Part 2)"
 SZC_country_intro_content_2: "While the §PTibetan§! invasion was repelled, this was not the end of §aSichuan's§! troubles. In 1931, a group of §RKuomintang-aligned§! officers, §Pwarlords§! and §aformer governors§! of §aSichuan§!, the §SOfficer Department§!, launched its first expedition into §aSichuan§! from their bases in northern §aYunnan§!, with tacit support from §PTang Jiyao's Republican government§!. The tattered §aSichuanese§! forces under §aYang§! were no match for the §RKMT§! troops, being routed time and again, losing most of their supplies to the advancing invasion forces. With the §aClique§! on the brink of collapse, warlord §aYang Sen§!, in a move of desperation, formed a temporary alliance with §PChongqing§! warlord §PLiu Xiang§! and his clique, the §PIndustrial Corps§!. With assistance from §PLiu's§! forces, §aYang§! was able to beat back the expedition. Further cooperation with the §PIndustrial Corps§! allowed §aSichuan§! to begin rebuilding its army, at the cost of ever increasing §PIndustrial Corps§! influence within the government.\n\nAnother group to rise in influence at this time was §cDeng Xihou's Baoding Department§!, whose forces helped suppress the §SOfficer Department§! while §aYang§! rebuilt his forces. The highly visible work by the §cBaoding Department§! in suppressing the rebels led to an increase in the group's popularity, which is seen by more and more citizens as the true protectors of §aSichuan§!.\n\nAnother invasion attempt in 1933 by §aYunnan§!, in support of the §SOfficer Department§!, was quickly aborted when the §PLeague-Marshal of the Eight Provinces§!, §PSun Chuanfang§!, threatened to intervene. The unexpected §aYunnanese§! retreat allowed §aYang§! to partially reoccupy §asouthern Sichuan§!. The chaos also allowed §aTian Songyao§! to establish himself in the northeast as a §aminor warlord§!, yet his ambitions remain a mystery."

 SZC_country_intro_header_3: "§aSichuan§!, Divided"
 SZC_country_intro_content_3: "§aSichuan§! in 1936 stands divided, with multiple factions vying for absolute power.\n\nThe ruling faction at the moment is the §aArmament Department§!, led by §aYang Sen§! and his close associate §PLiu Cunhou§!. Due to §cWu Peifu's§! personal support over the years, the §aDepartment§! is closely aligned to the §PZhili authorities§! in §cBeijing§! and §PNanjing§!. While their influence remains secure for now, the §aclique§! has grown dependent on §PZhili support§! in the last decade. Should something befall the §PZhili§!, §aYang's§! authority will be dangerously threatened.\n\n§aYang's§! chief rival for control over §aSichuan§! is §PChongqing§! warlord §PLiu Xiang§!, leader of the §PIndustrial Corps§!. §PLiu Xiang§! remains an erstwhile ally of §aYang§! since the §RKMT§! expedition in 1931, but §PLiu§! is an ambitious man and makes no secret of his desire to rule §aSichuan§!. Should the opportunity appear, the §PIndustrial Corps§! may quickly reconsider the usefulness of their alliance with §aYang Sen§!.\n\nThe third most important faction is the §cBaoding Department§!, a clique formed by former §cBaoding§! graduates - though this is not a prerequisite for membership - and led by §aYang's§! general §cDeng Xihou§!. In the last few years, their highly visible operations against §Srebel enclaves§! in the south have seen them gain popularity among the people. The §cBaoding Department§! forms a core of §aYang's§! support in the region. While §cDeng§! has long been loyal to §aYang§!, he may very well be considered a threat to §aYang's§! rule.\n\nIn the south, the remnants of a §RKMT§! expedition in 1931 continue to hold territory. The §SOfficer Department§!, as they are called, are the main group openly resisting §aYang's§! control of §aSichuan§!. Led by §aLü Chao§! and §lXiong Kewu§!, the group maintains close relations with the nearby clique of §aYunnan§!, on whose support they depend to survive."

Starting off as whispers of protests suppressed by League police forces, our border guards now report streams of refugees fleeing violence and an explosion of banditry flowing across our borders.\n\nIt appears a peaceful protest in Wuhu escalated into a violent bloodbath after League forces fired upon the protestors - a scene that began to repeat itself across the League in the days following what is now being termed the 'Wuhu Incident'. Some are now claiming the League - and the Zhili order that backs it up - are on their last legs, though most are still willing to believe that military force can keep the unrest contained."

With the League collapsing in the aftermath of Sun's shooting, KMT rebels long thought suppressed have risen up in Fujian in an attempt to restore the National Government. The governor of Anqing has declared war on Qi, accusing him of masterminding the assassination attempt to take over the League. Further west, the governors of Hunan, Guangxi and Guangdong have refused to recognise the authority of the new League-Marshal, but so far have not opened hostilities.\n\nThe situation has become dire enough for the central government in Beijing to become directly involved, with Qing troops and supplies already on their way south.

With the League collapsing in the aftermath of Sun's shooting, KMT rebels long thought suppressed have risen up in Fujian in an attempt to restore the National Government. The governor of Anqing has declared war on Qi, accusing him of masterminding the assassination attempt to take over the League. Further west, the governors of Hunan, Guangxi and Guangdong have refused to recognise the authority of the new League-Marshal, but so far have not opened hostilities.\n\nTo make matters worse, the government in Beijing has refused to intervene to restore order and is facing massive protests over its decision. Dissidents all over China are already loudly proclaiming Wu's decision as proof of Zhili weakness and incompetence. It seems Zhili control over China is breaking and our enemies are surely watching."

 sichuan_events.8.t: "Liu Xiang Mobilises Against Us"
 sichuan_events.8.d: "As the fragile Sichuanese order turns against us with the troubles in the League of Eight Provinces, Liu Xiang has decided to cross the Rubicon, so to speak. With his large army, he has moved out of Chongqing and soldiers loyal to him have been seen moving all around Sichuan, mainly in its Eastern portions. Our former allies have betrayed us and our friends have left us. For now, however, the Baoding Department has decided to maintain the course. All around Sichuan, armies are mobilising - and we must mobilise too. The time has come for us to cast the die, the fate of Sichuan hangs in the balance."

 sichuan_events.9.d: "Sichuan has descended into chaos.\n\nAll across the province, the forces of the formally allied Accelerated Department battle with one another, with Liu Xiang's forces battling Yang Sen's forces. The Armament Department and the Baoding Department have temporarily allied with Yang Sen's forces, and have been joined by the minor Officer Department, fighting side-by-side against the largest army in Sichuan. Liu Xiang has continued to issue offensive orders from his command in Chongqing for his troops to move in and engage all forces of the Yang Sen Accelerated Department, Armament Department, and Baoding Department.\n\nIn Tongren, the federalist forces under Xiong Kewu have seen an opportunity to make their way back into Sichuan. Joined by the remnant Kuomintang forces under Lü Chao, and the ever present guerrillas in South-Eastern Sichuan, they have proven themselves capable of knocking the delicate Sichuan order into complete disarray.\n\nThe Baoding Department has, so far, remained loyal to Chengdu, with their forces fighting alongside Yang Sen's in the bloody war of provincial unification. The facade of stability in Sichuan has been broken and only the heavens know what will come of the province."

 sichuan_events.50.t: "Yang Sen Requests Support"
 sichuan_events.50.d: "Dire news has arrived from Chengdu wired through our Chief Officer in the Southwest, He Guoguang. The tenuous peace in the province of Sichuan has fallen apart as a direct result of the loss of stability of the Zhili National Order, following the troubles in the League of Eight Provinces. Greatly diminishing the influence of the Sichuanese leader, and key ally of the Zhili, Yang Sen, the internal divisions in the province have escalated into open conflict. Fellow Accelerated Department member and Chongqing warlord Liu Xiang, has turned on governor Yang sen and his forces with the largest army in the province in tow. For now at least, Yang's allies in the Baoding department under Deng Xihou, Liu Wenhui, and Tian Songyao remain, but even that is an uncertainty as the situation spirals further out of control with every passing day.\n\nAlready the Zhili Clique, frequently meeting behind closed doors, have begun to scramble for a response. With chaos seizing the administration, many have had to rely upon personality, rather than constitutionalism, to push through with their proposals. Albeit, despite all pretences, it is not a factional divide on the Sichuan Issue, but that of a logistical one.\n\nWith the current chaos in Sichuan, it cannot be ruled out that a prolonged conflict where both sides exhaust their strength could lead to the remnants of Xiong Kewu seizing the moment to reverse their old misfortunes. As if that wasn't enough, persistent droughts have hit Sichuan's already struggling people. With disaster looming, the Zhili's old friend, Governor Yang, has reached out to the Clique through He, pleading that it offers any support it may muster. While the consequences of a defeat for Yang could prove severe for the Clique in the future, neither the Jade Marshal nor King of Baoding have deigned to comment much, albeit in private it has been reported that Wu Peifu has prepared a small aid package for his old friend."

 sichuan_events.51.d: "After so many of erstwhile \"allies\" have proceeded to show their trues faces in a drastic times, few expected much from the Central Government, one already mired with the League Collapse especially. And yet, as of recent reports from He Guoguang indicate, a stream of money and supplies have started to pour into Chengdu, circumnavigating Liu Xiang's forces narrowly.\n\nHeeding Governor Yang's request for help, it would appear that Luoyang has pledged to support [SZC.GetLeader] and the [SZC.GetRulingParty] in its efforts to maintain stability within the province. With good news finally ringing out within Yang Sen's Clique, the soldiers have reported an increase in morale, and the supplies provided will surely prove invaluable as Yang Sen's coalition faces the full might of Liu Xiang's forces."
 sichuan_events.51.a: "How very magnanimous!"

 sichuan_events.52.t: "The Zhili Abandons Us"
 sichuan_events.52.d: "It would appear nowadays that everyone within the nation has been cast away with misfortune. Betrayed by Liu Xiang already, and only tentatively holding an alliance with the Armament, Baoding, and Officer Departments, Governor Yang's desperate situation resulted in a casting of a lifeline towards Luoyang, or even Beijing. Through the Zhili's contact in the Southwest, He Guoguang, Yang was able to utilise his direct connection to his old friend Wu Peifu to enlist some form of support for his campaign against Liu.\n\nAnd yet, it would appear that the Central Government has deemed it unnecessary, or perhaps, is too busy, to aid the Governor in maintaining order. Far more concerned with internal matters following Nanjing's instability, rather than personal loyalty, the Zhili has refused to aid Yang, leaving the Governor to his own fate. With morale already plummeting, few of the common soldiery have hope that they will be able to defy Liu's army in men, or materiel."

 sichuan_events.53.d: "The military clique of Sichuan to the north has collapsed into civil war, with the various warlords of the province turning on each other. While in most cases this would be business as usual in China, the area around Tongren in Guizhou has been \"garrisoned\" by the federalist forces of former Sichuan governor Xiong Kewu ever since the Northern Expedition. Whilst usually a non-occurence, especially now with the Guizhou Kuomintang Military Occupation, and with Dian having its own problems, the Sichuan Civil War has provided a rare opportunity.\n\nMarching into the province for one final shot at a return to glory, Xiong has made a rather curious request to [YUN.GetLeader]. Whilst the relationship between Xiong Kewu and the Dian Army has waxed and waned over the years, the former Governor has put animosity aside, perhaps rather brazenly, to request support in his endeavour.\n\nAlready an outlandish request in its own right, especially of [YUN.GetLeader], Xiong has asked for men, or materiel, to aid him in intervening in the Sichuan Civil War. Clearly desperate for any goodwill, few could besmirch [YUN.GetLeader] for simple refusing his terms; they are too costly, and bring too little assurances of any return on investment in the future. But there does remain the opportunity to dispatch some less than loyal men away from Kunming. At least, as long as it doesn't result in a repeat of the last time Export Militarism failed in Sichuan."

 sichuan_events.54.d: "Whilst scarcely a prosperous province, or a particularly stable one at present, the Yunnan Clique still possesses a significant army, and that is a fact that they all too commonly prefer to remind their neighbouring provinces of Guizhou, Guangxi, and Sichuan. Once again, it would appear that Yunnan aims to make a bid within Sichuan local politics, despite their own ruinous internal situation.\n\nHaving marched onwards from Tongren in Guizhou, Xiong Kewu's units have proven stronger and far better equipped than previous intelligence suggested, with many units sporting what would appear to be Yunnanese second-hand rifles. What is perhaps even worse, are the various reports of Dian Army soldiers and officers directly participating in battles and skirmishes. It would appear that once more, the Master of the Eastern Continent has stepped foot within the Red River Basin."

 sichuan_events.55.t: "Liu Xiang's Forces Approach Suining"
 sichuan_events.55.d: "Reports are coming in that large forces of Liu Xiang's army have managed to march towards Suining at an alarming pace. This crucial location is of great strategic importance due to its proximity to both Xiang's and [ROOT.GetLeader]'s' base of power, serving as the hub of the road network in the southern basin not far from Chongqing.\n\nLiu Cunhou, Yang's temporary ally, has claimed that the city can be defended against the superior numbers of Liu's forces, and that even if spread thin, the alliance's joint fortifications in and around the city will even the odds in its favour.\n\nGuo Rudong, another capable commander of the alliance, has advocated for a more cautious approach to [ROOT.GetLeader], claiming that a strategic withdrawal would allow the alliance's currently thin lines to recuperate, and proceed to fight from a better position in the days following."

 sichuan_events.56.t: "Flight to the North"
 sichuan_events.56.d: "After extensive planning and careful preparations, our forces managed to organise and pull off an orderly withdrawal from Suining. Little of military use was left behind as they withdrew to the north, with their numbers were fully intact both in men and equipment. While Liu Xiang now controls the region, the alliance's forces are in a much better position to deal with any future incursions by his forces. The situation may be far from ideal, but opting for the safe alternative has won Governor [ROOT.GetLeader] valuable time and saved many lives."
 sichuan_events.56.a: "We got our troops out safely, at least."

 sichuan_events.57.t: "Battle in Jianyang"
 sichuan_events.57.d: "The quickest route was also the most predictable. On their way to Chengdu, the alliance's forces were attacked in their flanks by Liu Xiang's advancing armies. Despite putting up a valiant resistance, the alliance's forces were decimated as they were attacked in the open by Liu Xiang's soldiers. While some forces managed to break out of the dire situation and live on to fight another day, valuable manpower and equipment was lost in the hasty retreat."
 sichuan_events.57.a: "This is not good."

 sichuan_events.58.t: "Encircled in Suining"
 sichuan_events.58.d: "Since the order to hold Suining at all costs was issued, a confident Liu Cunhou had his forces dig in and prepare for the inevitable assault. As Liu's forces dug in, the forces of Liu Xiang moved out and encircled the city with their overwhelming advantage in numbers whilst the defenders were none the wiser.\n\nThe battle was traumatically brief as most of the forces of the Armament Department surrendered in droves once realisation had set in that they'd merely dug their own graves around a doomed city, netting Liu Xiang a complete victory. A disgraced Liu Cunhou fled north to the Zhili, narrowly escaping capture himself after this strategic blunder."

 sichuan_events.59.t: "Neijiang Under Assault"
 sichuan_events.59.d: "Liu Xiang's and Yang Sen's forces have been engaged in heavy fighting over the river crossings around Neijiang as of recent. The river crossings are of huge strategic importance as whomever is in control of them effectively controls the gateways into the Sichuan basin. These battles have raged on since the outbreak of hostilities, but it seems to appear as if Liu Xiang has begun preparations to launch a final push to seize the bridgeheads.\n\nWhilst outnumbered, [ROOT.GetLeader] has been advised of the opportunity to funnel Liu Xiang's forces into well-prepared defences along the aforementioned bridgeheads, where it is hoped that their numbers will be cut down, although it'd certainly be a costly victory if we aim to hold off the entire might of his forces.\n\nRather ingeniously put forward by Xia Jong, the alliance could have its engineers rig the bridgeheads to blow and trap Liu Xiang's forces. Doing so would prove costly in the long term however, as the strategic infrastructure of the region would be left in tatters."
 sichuan_events.59.a: "Defend the bridgeheads at all costs!"
 sichuan_events.59.b: "Let them cross, then blow the bridges."

 SZC_battle_neijiang_defend: "§gNeijiang controls some of the largest crossings and would be well positioned to attack Liu Xiang's flanks if it is held. However, the attacks by Liu Xiang's forces become more intense by the day. If this trend continues, our defenders may be overrun.§!"
 SZC_battle_neijiang_blow: "§PUsing timed explosives on the bridges, we can draw a fair amount of Liu Xiang's soldiers into becoming trapped on our side of the Tuo River and the lack of bridges will make its capture useless for Liu. It will also become useless to us, unfortunately.§!"

 sichuan_events.60.t: "Neijiang Overrun By Enemy Forces"
 sichuan_events.60.d: "[ROOT.GetLeader]'s soldiers and engineers have spent day and night preparing the defences of the bridgeheads around Neijiang. Trenches were dug, sandbags and barbed wire was put in place, and machine guns and mortars were positioned into effective kill zones for anyone daring to approach them. The first waves of attackers were cut down en masse, but as the hours turned into days and the relentless assaults refused to let up, the forces of [ROOT.GetLeader]'s alliance began to run low on ammunition, equipment, and soldiers in face of this overwhelming attack. Progressively, positions were overrun, and much of the Armament Department's best soldiers were lost in the brutal assault."

The following morning, [ROOT.GetLeader]'s' forces feigned a withdrawal from the bridges and as expected. Liu Xiang's opposing commanding officer took the bait. As the army columns crossed to the other side, the explosives were triggered. Anyone that had made it to the other side was caught in an ambush as [ROOT.GetLeader]'s' forces emerged, surrendering in droves amidst the panic and confusion that ensued. Anyone remaining on the other side simply watched on helplessly as their comrades-in-arms were overrun, crushing their morale. Despite the cost of the bridgeheads, a fantastic victory has been won for [ROOT.GetLeader]."

To pre-empt the coming catastrophe, Baoding troops under control of general Deng Xihou have entered Chengdu. With Yang's forces utterly bloodied and demoralised by their repeated setbacks, it was effectively a bloodless coup as Yang's rule was brought to an end with but a whimper. Following the seizure of Chengdu, the Baoding Department seized full control of the surrounding counties, and the last few forces loyal to Yang either deserted or joined Deng's side. With the situation remaining as dire as ever, it now falls upon the Baoding Department to conclude what Governor Yang Sen, and General Liu Cunhou could not."
 sichuan_events.62.a: "We are Sichuan's last stand."

 sichuan_events.63.t: "The Siege of Chengdu"
 sichuan_events.63.d: "Early in the morning, the formations of Liu Xiang's army finally arrived near Chengdu for what he hoped would be the final battle of his campaign. It very well could be, but it's a high stakes gamble, to say the least, because at this important juncture, the majority of his armies have begun to tire from weeks of marching and fighting.\n\nThe city itself is surrounded by channels derived from Dujiangyan's levees upriver and fortified by walls dating back to the late Qing era, before the Xinhai Revolution. Old as they might be and built before the time of modern artillery, the walls still stretch nearly seven miles around the city and stand at over thirty feet in height. Effectively they form a mighty citadel, that has stood the test of time, which makes it a daunting task for any attacking army to breach.\n\nKnowing that a head-on assault would cause ruin to the Chongqing army, Liu has instead opted to lay siege to Chengdu. Sporadic shelling has been exchanged between both forces all morning, but it's clear that Liu Xiang's troops have no hopes of breaching the defences anytime soon and have thus dug in for a long siege. Whilst [ROOT.GetLeader]'s' defences stand for now, the city will be his grave if he simply waits behind its walls.\n\nSwift action must be taken, and already the command staff is at work attempting to present various disparate plans for a counterattack to relieve the siege. Albeit many fear within the command headquarters that the infighting will prove to be Chengdu's demise."
 sichuan_events.63.a: "Sichuan's fate hangs in the balance."

 sichuan_events.64.t: "Choosing a Plan of Attack"
 sichuan_events.64.d: "Liu Xiang's forces have advanced on Chengdu from the east and south and have begun to subject the city to a thorough siege. Utterly poignant in the air is the fact that all will be lost if [ROOT.GetLeader] does not act fast and mount a relief effort to break the siege. His military leaders all know that they simply can't wait this one out and that offence is the only defence in this situation.\n\nOne such plan proposed by [ROOT.GetLeader]'s commanders is to take advantage of their thin spread around the city to try and cut off and encircle Liu Xiang's forces in a bold offensive strike against Jianyang. In doing so, it is hoped that they can force the surrender of his main force, especially his prized engineer units.\n\nOn the other hand, with most of their experienced forces committed to the siege, other members of his high command believe that they should cut the head of the snake by attacking Chongqing outright. The city should be lightly defended by Xiang's reserve units under mayor Pan Wenhua and its capture would massively disorganise Liu's efforts due to the city's vital infrastructure.\n\nFinally, there are the officers in [ROOT.GetLeader]'s ranks that warn him against putting all of his eggs into one basket, urging him instead to split up his forces and attack both targets at once, negating their chances to reinforce their objectives.\n\nThe only thing the high commands seem to agree on is that whatever course of action is pursued must be considered carefully as there is no room for mistakes."
 sichuan_events.64.a: "Move towards Jianyang to encircle his forces."

 SZC_troop_mobilisation_jianyang: "§lLiu Xiang's best forces are concentrated around Chengdu due to the ongoing siege and our forces may be able to cut off Xiang's supply lines by taking the nearby town of Jianyang. We will need all our available forces for this course of action, which will leave the south unattended, possibly giving the Officer Department an opening.§!"
 SZC_troop_mobilisation_chongqing: "§PThe continuing control of Chongqing is absolutely vital for Liu's war effort and its capture would be a deathly blow to his cause. On the other hand, Pan Wenhua commands a sizeable garrison in the city. Should we fail to quickly overwhelm the city's defences, we risk being caught in a pincer movement between the garrison and any troops Liu Xiang sends to counter our advance.§!"
 SZC_troop_mobilisation_split: "§gSplitting our forces into two attack groups will prevent Xiang and Wenhua from reinforcing each other, but this means our army will need to fight most of Liu Xiang's Army at once. Liu Xiang's forces are strong and our army might not be up to the task.§!"

 sichuan_events.65.d: "Having over-extended themselves, the most experienced forces under Liu Xiang were committed to the siege of [ROOT.GetLeader]'s capital while the flanks and rear were guarded by a fresh conscripts from their reserve.

Their superior numbers were spent trying to encircle Chengdu and now they have been cut off absolutely, stuck between [ROOT.GetLeader]'s' main force and the relatively intact Chengdu garrison."

After cutting off Liu Xiang's main forces, a swift battle followed between [ROOT.GetLeader]'s' forces and the trapped vanguard of Liu Xiang's army, now desperately attempting to break out of the encirclement. With nowhere to retreat and no hope to be rescued, it wasn't long before morale and unit cohesion broke down within their ranks, leading to their surrender in droves.\n\nWith Chengdu safe, [ROOT.GetLeader] has been tasked with pressing the initiative directly into the enemy's heartland!"

While in normal times such an attack would not be a major threat, the continued existence of units in Chongqing Garrison formerly under Liu Xiang's control, and more worringly, swirling rumors about contact between the Garrison, Xiong Kewu's Forces, and the Officer Department, have caused worries of an unholy alliance between the three to oppose Yang Sen."

 sichuan_events.68.d: "Having gambled big on a quick victory and losing it all, Liu Xiang's overstretched, exposed, and exhausted vanguard of his army has been utterly routed after weeks of fighting with little regard for losses. Liu Xiang now gazes upon utter defeat at the front and treachery in the rear. Demoralised from their many setbacks, and with their vital stronghold of Chongqing lost, the remaining troops of his have begun to desert and defect en masse. Meanwhile, Liu Xiang is nowhere to be found, presumably having fled Sichuan like a coward rather than sharing the fate of his soldiers. With only token resistance remaining from this once formidable force, it is only a matter of time before they surrender completely."

With rumours circulating all-around Sichuan about an alliance to keep Governor Yang Sen in-check, it would appear they have to come to fruition. It would appear that an unholy alliance has been brokered to defeat the incumbent Governor once and for-all.\n\nCounting the remnants of Liu Xiang's forces, the invading army of Xiong Kewu, and the opportunistic Officer Department of Li Jiayu, they have proven themselves almost strong enough to contend with the recently victorious forces of Yang Sen's Alliance, and thus, it would appear that Sichuan enters into a new phase of civil war."

 sichuan_events.70.t: "Clashes in Ziliujing"
 sichuan_events.70.d: "Despite the alliance between Officers and Federalists, all is not lost. As the two forces have yet to link up, Yang Sen still maintains the initiative in the conflict. United, they're a potent force. Alone, many of their units, Xiong Kewu's in particular, are ragtag militia and conscripts against a veteran army, exhausted as it may be. Any clever general would use this opportunity to strike while they're still divided, and despite only seeing small skirmishes in the area so far, a big battle between the three forces is inevitable.\n\n[ROOT.GetLeader]'s forces in the area are led by Xia Jiong, a close confidant of Yang sen. The forces he commands are mostly veterans with several victories to their credit and a fair amount of heavy equipment still intact. His enemies constitute a force of equally veteran, but poorly equipped, Federallist forces led by Yu Jitang, and Chongqing forces being led by Wang Lingji. All other things considered, both should not be underestimated. Where the battle takes place is of Xia's choosing - the area around Ziliujing is a mix of hills and plains with plenty of forests."

While not a pushover by any estimate, it's still a fact that Liu Xiang's military defeats had spent most of his best soldiers and equipment. The Garrison's forces were lighter equipped, particularly with artillery. The fate of this gamble would be decided outside of Tongnan, a town northwest of Chongqing.\n\nWhen the two armies made contact, it was made clear that an attack by the rash Xia Jiong had been expected, and the Chongqing Garrison had been preparing to hold its ground. Despite thrusting their all into battle, Xia Jiong's Forces were badly mauled before managing to unseat the Chongqing forces from their defensive position. However the cost of victory has been great, and the forces of the Officer Department have manoeuvred to the direction of Chengdu whilst federalist forces have prepared themselves to confront the worn out remnants of Xia Jiong's army"

In doing so and relying on a mix of static and elastic defences against what turned out to be a very mobile and aggressive force, however, the clash around Ziliujing soon turned into a cage for its conquerors.\n\nRather than taking the bait, the Federalist forces knew that attacking such an obvious strongpoint would be a disaster and relied upon hit-and-run tactics instead. In choosing to rely on a strong defence rather than a mobile offence, Xia Jong ceded the initiative to his enemies. After a few days of sporadic fighting with light losses on both sides, Wang Lingji's Chongqing reserve arrived to relieve Yu Jitang's forces. Now, the veteran Federalists were backed up by the remaining might of Liu Xiang's army with its heavy equipment. The fort thus became a trap as the artillery of Wang Lingji was now raining upon its walls, restricting the movements of its defenders. While the city itself was safe due to neither side wanting to risk the lives of its inhabitants, any attempt to move out would lead to large losses for Xia's forces. While portions of Wang Lingji's and Yu Jitangs's forces remain committed in Ziliujing, a large detachment has been sent moving towards Chengdu on the now open road, recruiting resentful civilians and deserters from Liu Xiang's old army alike as they go. With every step they take, they grow stronger while [ROOT.GetLeader] weakens behind his walls.\n\nDespite Xia's forces being tied down, he has already made plans for a safe withdrawal and should be able to make it out with most of his forces intact. The bad news is, by the time he does, it's doubtful whether there's still a Chengdu for him to relieve."

Unwilling to endure another siege with absolutely no hope of relief, the garrison simply raised a white flag over the city's main gates rather than subjecting the city's people and historical legacy to needless death and destruction. Though the mighty walls of the city remain unbroken, the same cannot be said for the will to fight among those behind them. Chengdu is now under the control of the Officer Department and thus seems to end Sichuan's latest round of civil war. The victorious forces rejoice, celebrating in the mostly empty streets of the ancient city. Its inhabitants remain indoors, and at this point most are just relieved that the war is over."

 sichuan_events.73.t: "The Federalist Route"
 sichuan_events.73.d: "Having been out of fighting beyond a myriad of skirmishes over the years, few were truly aware of the capabilities of Xiong Kewu's forces. Operating in similar areas as the East Sichuan Insurgents, or that of Lü Chao's Industrial Corps, Xia Jong opted to treat his opponent similar to his contemporaries, drawing them out into open conflict. To aide him was that of Yu Jitang's relative lack of experience, as Xiong's more skilled officers had been dispatched elsewhere.\n\nThe plan was risky, but Xia is a man known for his preference for action, and that sacrifices are unavoidable. His main force was to remain concentrated in the rear, with a few forward detachments being sent out as bait for the Federalist army to take. Throughout the morning, Yu Jitang's forces made probing attacks against their enemies. While unsuccessful at first, eventually Yu Jitang concluded that these forward forces were likely to be the only Accelerated Department forces in the area, as they had received no reinforcements, nor withdrawn and reported his activities. Once realising Yu's forces switched towards a full-frontal assault, Xia's forward detachments were swift to withdraw as overwhelming numbers headed their way. Losses weren't light, but enough of them managed to return to friendly lines.\n\nPressing the advantage, Yu's forces caught up with the retreating forces, but were hammered by the artillery and machine gun emplacements that the Accelerated Department had set up. The trap had sprung, but now they had the unenviable task of trying to conclude their trap. Jitang's forces lacked heavy equipment, but they were still a formidable force led by morale and perseverance. By the end of the first day the Federalists withdrew, hoping to draw the enemy out into a more favourable position. When Xia Jong held his forces in place rather than fall for his own trick, the assaults continued well into the next day. All the while, the forces from the Chongqing Garrison failed to provide support, as their heavy equipment meant that it'd be at least half a week before they could make contact with the two fighting generals.\n\nAfter days of fighting, Yu Jitang had taken crippling losses and was forced to withdraw to regroup and recover. Once Wang Lingji received word that the force he was supposed to link up with was beaten in battle, he decided to turn around back towards Chongqing. The gambit was costly, but it'd won the day for the Accelerated Department, and the road to Chongqing was now open."

 sichuan_events.74.t: "The Fall of Chongqing"
 sichuan_events.74.d: "Following a short seige, the heart of what formed Liu Xiang's clique had been overrun by [ROOT.GetLeader]'s' determined soldiers. Despite being heavily depleted from the brutal civil war, the ancient city's small garrison under command of Wang Lingji offered stiff - albeit futile - resistance as Xia Jiong's troops cleared them out street by street in the days that followed. After several days of fighting, the Upper City finally fell and with it the city's industries. The fighting did, however, leave parts of the city in ruins, including many of its factories and critical infrastructure.\n\nWith any hopes of victory lost, along with their erstwhile alliance, most of the remaining Officer Department troops have begun to retreat back to their holdings. The war is finally over, and Yang Sen has retained control of Sichuan."
 sichuan_events.74.a: "We are victorious."

 sichuan_events.75.t: "Chongqing Under Assault"
 sichuan_events.75.d: "The war had started to take a toll on Yang Sen's forces. As they approached Chongqing, the veterans of this force were both eager to finally stand at the brink of victory, but also well-aware of the fact that they were about to take on the difficult task that laid ahead. They were to seize not only the enemy's final stronghold, but also take on one of China's major industrial hubs. A battle for this city would surely be difficult as each of the mighty factories of the city could easily be turned into a fortress for any defender.\n\nWhile time is of the essence, a head-on assault is a very difficult task. The hilly areas around the city could provide [ROOT.GetLeader]'s forces with excellent positions for spotting and to place their artillery, giving them a tremendous strategic advantage going in. Some commanders on the ground are suggesting that the time it would take to secure those positions to take advantage of them is time that we simply do not have, preferring a swift assault against the battered remnants of Liu Xiang's forces instead."

 sichuan_events.75.b: "Assault the city, we have little time!"

 SZC_chongqing_hills: "§POur officers on the ground are insisting that we should take the hills and use them to our advantage. It could save a lot of lives and provide a big strategic advantage in the battle ahead, both against Chongqing and our pursuers. It is, however, time-consuming and will spread our forces thin.§!"
 SZC_chongqing_assault: "§gOur generals are insisting that they have the numbers to take the city in a head-on assault. With every minute wasted allowing the enemy to entrench further while a second army approaches their flanks, this call for an all-out assault is hardly without merit.§!"

 sichuan_events.76.t: "Defeat in Chongqing"
 sichuan_events.76.d: "Faced with only difficult options, a direct assault against the under-equipped garrison seemed like the most likely to succeed. Wasting no time, the forces charged under cover of artillery fire as they stormed the trenches surrounding the city. After hours of fighting, the Armament Department had seized these positions, albeit at a heavy cost in lives. The rushed deployment also meant that the inaccurate artillery had a fairly limited effect on the field. Worse yet, once the trenches were taken it was clear that Pan Wenhua had managed to gradually withdraw his forces as the attackers made progress. He was gambling for an effective delaying operation, and it was working.\n\nAs running into the city at night would be a disorganised suicide, the Armament Department could only wait in the ancient city's outskirts for daybreak while Pan Wenhua rushed to prepare new defences inside the city itself and have the civilians evacuate towards the inner sections of Chongqing. Once daybreak came, every factory and every government facility had been turned into a makeshift fort. Progress was slow, and the Armament Department soon became bogged down in street fighting. After a second night with little progress, the situation grew desperate as the enemy's reinforcement were rapidly approaching. Knowing that they'd be destroyed if caught between the two armies, the next day saw no fighting. Instead, a few soldiers were sent with a white flag to discuss their surrender. It was accepted by Pan Wenhua shortly thereafter, ending the brief battle for Chongqing with a catastrophe for the Armament Department.\n\nIn the end, the attacking force became prisoners of war and with some of the most experienced soldiers wiped from their order of battle, it's now very unlikely for the Armament Department to be able to recover. Already word of this defeat is spreading among the people, despite the best effort of the censors in Chengdu. To say that their will to resist Liu Xiang has diminished would be an understatement."
 sichuan_events.76.a: "It's all over now..."

 sichuan_events.77.t: "The Fall of Chongqing"
 sichuan_events.77.d: "Moving in at night, the hills were taken with relative ease. The Chongqing garrison had evidently focused its defences on the city itself in an all-or-nothing approach, likely because Pan Wenhua hardly has soldiers to spare either. Before dawn, [ROOT.GetLeader]'s engineers had established positions on the hills followed by the arrival of light artillery and observers under the cover of darkness. Once daybreak came, his soldiers were able to launch their assault on the city with the enemy forces still far behind them. Their charge was initiated by a barrage that was as accurate as it was devastating against the entrenchments of the defenders, and soon the fighting for the city itself raged.\n\nDespite the odds, the heart of Liu Xiang's faction was soon being overrun by Yang's forces. In the hours that followed, the ancient city's small garrison offered disorganised resistance as the Armament Department followed the Accelerated department in clearing them out street by street. The swiftness of the assault and ferocity of the bombardment had crushed Wenhua's plans of gradually falling back into the city, and now his forces were being mopped up at a rapid pace. Before long, the city and its mighty industries finally fell. The fighting did, however, leave parts of the city in ruins, including many of its factories and critical infrastructure. Once the dust settled, Pan Wenhua was nowhere to be found. He's presumed to either killed in the battle for the city, or having fled long ago.\n\nThe city had fallen so quickly that the forces sent to relieve it had no idea of its fate. Thus, they were greeted by shelling from the mountains and fire from the city's outskirts as they approached. Realising quickly they were too late as they saw the banners of the Armament Department flying over the city, they were quick to raise a white flag. Their surrender was accepted without further bloodshed, and their capture now means that the Liu's forces are no longer a factor."

 sichuan_events.78.t: "Liu Xiang's forces Begin to Disintegrate"
 sichuan_events.78.d: "Liu Xiang gambled big on a quick victory and lost it all. Overstretched, exposed and exhausted from weeks of fighting with little regard for losses, the vanguard of his forces has been utterly routed. Xiang now faces utter defeat at the front and attacks from his rear. Demoralised from their many setbacks and with their vital stronghold of Chongqing lost, his troops have begun to throw away their guns and uniforms, hoping to escape into the countryside as civilians. With only token resistance remaining from this once formidable force, it is only a matter of time before they surrender completely."
 sichuan_events.78.a: "About time!"

 sichuan_events.79.t: "Liu Xiang Escapes"
 sichuan_events.79.d: "Reports are coming in from Chongqing that Liu Xiang has abandoned his own soldiers and fled Sichuan. With the head of the snake cut off, what remained of his forces has ceased all resistance, either defecting to [ROOT.GetLeader]'s forces or deserting altogether. The war is over and Yang Sen has retained control of Sichuan."
 sichuan_events.79.a: "We are victorious."

 sichuan_events.80.t: "Defeat in Detail"
 sichuan_events.80.d: "In a daring all-or-nothing gamble, [ROOT.GetLeader] split the bulk of his remaining army south of Chengdu and had them attack the cities of Jianyang and Chongqing at once. With most of Liu Xiang's forces tied down in a lengthy siege, his armies could attack in both locations and still outnumber the overstretched enemy. Two large armies on the march are impossible to conceal, however, and neither force would ever reach their destinations before word of the Governor's intentions reached the enemy.\n\nSeizing the initiative, Liu Xiang was quick to divert his forces at once, leaving behind a token force to make sure that the Chengdu garrison remains tied down. As his plan hinged on the enemy being committed to the siege, the moment Liu Xiang's forces were on the move, [ROOT.GetLeader]'s forces were fighting time itself as fiercely as they were fighting scouts and local militias from Liu Xiang's forces. They were, however, oblivious to this fact before it was too late. The infrastructure in Sichuan was poor before the war and by this point [ROOT.GetLeader]'s army was marching through broken roads with radio communications being all but non-existent. The two armies didn't realise they were being chased before Liu Xiang's forces attacked them from behind.\n\nThe plan had no room for error and once the two halves of the army were attacked in their rears and flanks any semblance of cohesion quickly broke down as they scrambled to assume defensive positions. The losses on [ROOT.GetLeader]'s side had been crippling, however, and his forces had barely been able to begin entrenching before the final nail in the coffin was hammered in with the arrival of the Chongqing garrison's forces under the capable command of Wang Lingji. Hopelessly outnumbered, attacked on all sides and without any chance of survival, many soldiers surrendered or defected to the enemy. The battle has been lost and with it likely the war as well."
 sichuan_events.80.a: "We have gambled and consequently failed."

 sichuan_events.81.t.battle: "The Surrender of Chengdu"
 sichuan_events.81.d.battle: "Over the past few days nothing but bad news had reached the commanders in Chengdu and even with the army's censorship it was clear to everyone within the city that things were not going well beyond those tall walls. As the increasingly meagre rations were being handed out around noon, the city's lookouts were treated to an unpleasant surprise.\n\nMarching towards the city were thousands of soldiers wearing the uniforms of the Armament Department, followed closely by the forces of Liu Xiang. The bulk of this force stopped not far from the city's walls, with only a flatbed truck narrowing the gap between the besieging army and the city's walls. The truck wasn't loaded with enemy troops or bombs, but instead the vehicle was full of high-ranking officers from the Armament Department. One officer picked up a megaphone with shaky hands and as the man's identity dawned on the garrison, he started to address the soldiers manning the walls. Wang Lingji told them that they were all that remained of the relief force, that their armies were broken and that their so-called leaders had fled towards Beijing. But have no fear, he insisted, because Liu Xiang had been gracious enough to spare both them and the city if they surrendered.\n\nThe answer didn't let itself wait for too long. The commanders in charge of the garrison knew that with morale being as low as it was, once news got out that the entire Armament Department army had been crushed they'd surely have an insurrection on his hands. The tall walls of Chengdu still stood and the siege ended not with a bang, but with a white flag being raised above the now open city gates."
 sichuan_events.81.t.sapped: "The Fall of Chengdu"
 sichuan_events.81.d.sapped: "As the days went on, with no relief reaching the city, Liu Xiang's engineers were slowly but surely able to map out the weak points of the Qing-era defences around the city. Every night they toiled to dig beneath the city's walls and plant explosives in key locations. Just over a month into the siege, these explosively finally went off before the sun had risen. The massive explosions quickly caused large breaches in the walls, with the falling debris blocking some of the Dujiangyan levees that surrounded the city. In an instant, the walls that had stood for so long crumbled like dust with dozens of the city's defenders passing away in the initial explosions. This marked the final assault on Chengdu and it'd be a long and difficult battle for the large city.\n\nDespite the collapse of the walls and the capture of the East Gate, the garrison still put up stiff resistance against the attacking forces. Putting their knowledge of the city's layout to good use, the defences that the Chengdu garrison and drafted civilians had built within the city proved difficult to overcome even for the massively superior attacking force. Wherever they went, they were greeted by machine guns, snipers, mines and ambushing infantry. Though the garrison fought valiantly, it was all for naught. By the end of the first day, a sort of calm was brought in by the night with a third of the city having fallen. Liu Xiang's forces regrouped and in the morning they attacked the city's centre. Low on men and ammunition though, the half-starved defenders could only hold out for a few hours before they were forced to surrender the city hall to the advancing Accelerated Department. This marked the complete collapse of the city's defence with any remaining forces quickly surrendering. By the evening, Chengdu finally fell silent, a silence that would soon be broken by the cheers of the victorious Accelerated Department and its soldiers.\n\nAlthough he'd paid a high price for it, Liu Xiang's gamble for control over Sichuan had paid off."

 sichuan_events.84.t.victory: "The Defence of Guanxian"
 sichuan_events.84.d.victory: "Huang Yin had little time to prepare and even less to manoeuvre - though that did not seem to alarm the vetern commander. Believing that a cunning offence would be the best defence, he had planned for a string of night-time attacks against the enemy, with his forces' eventual withdrawal being backed by artillery barrages against the enemy's encampments. After forcing Liu's hand in a state of disarray, the first waves of his forces would be smashed by a mix of rear-guard actions and defensive artillery, with a series of infantry counter-attacks aimed at breaking up the exhausted attackers and force the Accelerated Department forces to retreat.\n\nAlthough the night-time raid was a success that disrupted Liu Xiang's planned offensive, the battle for Guanxian itself raged on for days. Most plans do not survive first contact with the enemy and this did not either. Both Liu Xiang's and Huang Yin's forces had their successes and setbacks as ground around the city was traded between the two. However any breakthrough that made by Liu Xiang's forces was swiftly met by a counter-attack or artillery barrage. After three days of fighting, Huang Yin's forces had been badly damaged, but the Accelerated Department were also badly bloodied to the point where they called off any further attacks, opting instead to regroup to fight again another day. Though the battle may be recorded as a draw by the history books, it's a strategic victory that has prevented our enemy from advancing to the south against Liu Wenhui."
 sichuan_events.84.t.flood: "The Baopingkou Floods"
 sichuan_events.84.d.flood: "At the orders of Huang Yin, military engineers set out to not build defences, but to block the Baopingkou Channel in a way that'd cause a controlled flooding, one that wouldn't affect the Baoding positions and causes as little civilian damage as possible. The goal was to flood Liu Xiang's forces and turn their encampments into a swamp. The military engineers worked hard to make sure that the damages to the Dujiangyan systems and the surrounding areas would be limited. Realising that they were short on time however, they could only hope to mitigate the destruction at best.\n\nOnce the preparations were made, the channels were blockaded with wooden slabs and from there it didn't take long for the surrounding levees to overflow away from their determined paths, straight into the encampments of the Accelerated Department. Many soldiers were rudely awakened as their tents offered absolutely no protection against the rising waters that slowly turned the grounds into a soggy swampland. Cases of guns were drenched and the ground that many artillery pieces stood upon quickly turned into a soft mud that slowly swallowed the larger guns. A hasty retreat followed with the troops trying to save as much of their equipment as possible from the rising water. Needless to say, their abandoned equipment and positions are as useless to Baoding as it is to them, but they certainly won't be able to mount an offensive now.\n\nAlthough a military victory, reports are coming in that despite our best efforts the damage to the Dujiangyan system has been considerable and that the floods have washed away many nearby crops. However, Baoding managed to win the initiative in the war without losing a single soldier, and only they can deem if the risk was worth it."

 sichuan_events.85.d: "Despite the strong defences set up by Huang Yin and various rear-guard actions taken against the enemy, the overwhelming numbers of the enemy and the strategic skills of Liu Xiang proved too much for Yin's forces to handle. Although the Accelerated Department paid a heavy price for their victory thanks in no small part to the many artillery kill zones set up beforehand, by the third day they'd broken through the defences through a mix of ruthless aggressiveness and discipline. A series of counter-attacks were mounted in an attempt to retake Huang Yin's defensive positions, but it was all for naught in the end and the banner of the Accelerated Department soon flew over the Er Wang Temple.\n\nHumbled by this defeat, the Baoding troops were forced to retreat further and further west. While a last-ditch defence of the Dujiangyan crossings has prevented a rout and allowed most troops to escape to Pixian to the southeast, Huang Yin's troops are now spread out defending the levees and will not be unable to reach Chengdu or Meishan in time to join Liu Wenhui's forces.

With Baoding's armies finally linked up, they will be able to finally bring an end to the traitor Liu Xiang and end this war."

Wasting no time, Liu Xiang has ordered his triumphant forces to advance south-west towards the Min River crossings. The arriving Xikang forces have found themselves facing an entrenched enemy across one of Sichuan's larger rivers. Unwilling to throw away his soldiers in a futile attack, Liu Wenhui has halted the planned offensive.\n\nBoth camps eye each other across the river, with only sporadic skirmishes and sniper fire being exchanged between the two sides. Both consider a river crossing to be suicide, a fact that spells doom for Baoding and success for its foes. With any attempt at relief being halted at the river, Chengdu has been cut off. We can only pray that its defenders pull off a miracle."

Beginning to take measures to fortify his now exposed positions, short of breaking the siege and retreating to Chongqing, this is the only card he seemed willing to able to play. And the defenders have taken clear notice. The resulting simultaneous movements led to both forces trying to outmanoeuvre each other, eventually leading to them crashing into each other in the village of Longquanyi, southeast of Chengdu.\n\nWhat started out as a small skirmish between scout detachments soon escalated into a full-blown battle. While Liu Xiang had the upper hand initially thanks to his own skill and his vast numbers, a determined defence of the countryside and the good coordination between [ROOT.GetLeader]'s commanders allowed his reinforcements from Chengdu and Guanxian to arrive in time to reinforce his positions and deal a decisive blow to the enemy forces. With the bulk of his forces broken, the only cohesive force that remains of the once mighty Accelerated Department outside of Chongqing is the token besieging force left around Chengdu, now trapped between [ROOT.GetLeader]'s vast armies and the walls of the city.

While in normal times such an attack would not be a major threat, the continued existence of units in Chongqing Garrison formerly under Liu Xiang's control, and more worringly, swirling rumors about contact between the Garrison, Xiong Kewu's Forces, and the Officer Department, have caused worries of an unholy alliance between the three to oppose Yang Sen."

A womaniser to some, an incalculable patrician to others, and even a despotic moderniser to even further groups, Yang's grip on the province is nigh nonexistant, beyond direct spheres of his Accelerated Department's control. And his weakness yet simultaneously rebounding strength is evident, not only to his allies in Armament, but to his enemies.\n\nRecently, convening a meeting in-secret, a large-scale alliance has formed within the Sichuan Conflict, one that is not particularly rare, positioning itself on the basis of fighting against Yang Sen's recovered strength. Formed in conjunction with the Baoding Department, Federalists, Officers Department, remnants of Liu Xiang's Accelerated Department, and many minor groups, it would appear that Yang Sen has been outmatched.\n\nWhilst the Anti-Yang Sen Coalition is far from able to truly push out the incumbent Governor, it has brought the conflict to a night stalemate, and many believe that Governor Yang will simply be forced out by circumstance, rather than by the bullet."

Following the Anti-Yang Sen alliance between the Officers Department, Baoding Department, remnants of Liu Xiang's Accelerated Department, and many other minor groups, the Zhili-backed Governor has seemingly been ousted by his own former allies. With the Armament Department unwilling to back Yang's own Accelerated Department, the Governor has been forced out, not from Chengdu, but from office.\n\nRetaining the largest military force within the province, and backed by significant control of its territory, the Baoding Department has managed to assert itself ontop of all of the other minor cliques to become the seeming rulers of Sichuan. Whilst minorly contested on all sides, none of the opposition seems to have the strength to truly oppose Baoding alone, nor the capabilities to cast away their animosity for each other.\n\nAssuming the position of \"Governor\", Deng Xihou has been largely placated by his newfound position within the province. Dominating the tracts outside key areas such as Chengdu and Chongqing, the new Governor's control is far from complete, and already rumours are mounting that men within his own ranks, such as Liu Wenhui, have begun to agitate for influence within the provincial government."

Formed out of (mostly) graduates from the Baoding Military Academy, Liu Wenhui, Tian Songyao, and Deng Xihou (although he did not graduate), the three men have been long friends and key players in the early politics of Sichuan whilst in an alliance against Yang Sen in 1925. Forming the \"Three Army Joint Office\" in 1926, the trio would amass significant influence within Sichuan.\n\nWith Liu Wenhui controlling most of Eastern Xikang, alongside Deng and Tian's control of numerous counties in Sichuan's North, the trio have managed to surpass being mere pawns in the Sichuan power-game, and have been granted a clear opportunity for their own bid to power. However, one clear-cut issue has arisen, and it is an all-encompassing one. The lone figure standing between Baoding and success is that of the initial matchstick: Liu Wenhui's Nephew, Liu Xiang, and his large portion of the Accelerated Department.\n\nWith the Race for Chongqing in full swing, Liu Wenhui has managed to draft a quick responsive unit to approach the city from his position to the west. Albeit, upon hearing news of such a gamble, Deng Xihou and Tian Songyao both telegraphed their \"partner\", insisting that it is within their prerogative to seize Chongqing as part of their sphere of influence.

 sichuan_events.95.d: "Liu Wenhui has had a bold plan since the start of this war: the capture of Chongqing from under the nose of Liu Xiang while his men are tied down in the siege of Chengdu. A bold and risky move, to be sure, but far more realistic than beating Liu Xiang's massive army in the open.\n\nKeeping an army of this size concealed for long was going to be impossible. It was a matter of when, not if, Liu Xiang's forces eventually caught on to the machinations of the Baoding army. Predictably, Liu Xiang ordered a detachment of his forces to leave the siege of Chengdu to intercept his uncle's army. This whole plan fell apart among the mountains and rivers of Sichuan, however, as the troops sent to attack Liu Wenhui's forces fell victim to the constant attacks of the of the Sichuan Insurgents, skirmishing forces of the Federalists, and sparse struggles with the Officer Department.\n\nAmbushes, traps and blocked roads meant that any hope to reinforce Chongqing was utterly futile. Wang Lingji's city garrison in Chongqing was now on its own as nothing seemed capable of stopping the Baoding force at this point."
 sichuan_events.95.a: "Now to make their efforts worthwhile."

 sichuan_events.96.t: "The Fall of Chongqing"
 sichuan_events.96.d: "Sending the bulk of the Baoding army towards Chongqing was an all-or-nothing gamble, but one where the odds seemed to be in our favour, thanks to our advantageous strategic position. Although Liu Xiang had foreseen this move, he'd not planned for unpredictable role of the Sichuan Insurgents, Federalists, and other miscellaneous groups.\n\nBe that as it may, Chongqing was still a heavily defended city, being the beating heart of Sichuan's industry. The Baoding commanders are known for their skill and that'd show during this battle. Opting for a methodical approach, Chongqing's defenders were flushed out one street at a time. Despite the size of the city and its garrison, however, the city would not hold out for long. Once Wang Lingji had learned that Liu Xiang's relief force wasn't going to arrive for at least another week thanks to the continuous attacks by the Officer guerrillas, he swallowed his pride and reached out with an offer of surrender, rather than seeing the city he was mayor of be reduced to rubble."
 sichuan_events.96.a: "A great victory!"

 sichuan_events.97.t: "Collapse of the Accelerated Department"
 sichuan_events.97.d: "Chongqing was a vital stronghold for Liu Xiang's forces, due to city's many factories and the control over the Yangtze River traffic. Cut off from this vital lifeline following Wang Lingji's surrender, Liu Xiang's troops currently besieging Chengdu have stopped receiving much-needed supplies such as food, ammunition and weapons. Perhaps most dire of all, the soldiers' paychecks have also ceased to arrive with the complete paralysis of Chongqing's administrative functions. Without guns, pay, or even a functional leadership structure, desertion and insubordination has become widespread. The siege of Chengdu has already faltered as most soldiers and officers feel that the war is lost and in the countryside the forces of the Accelerated Department began to melt away as news of the fall of Chongqing reached them. Most simply cast away their rifles and headed back towards their homes, unwilling to fight for a lost cause.\n\nAfter being outmatched in a mutual high-stakes gamble, Liu Xiang has utterly lost control of the situation. Seeing his army disintegrate and unwilling to face justice for his treachery, he has opted to flee along with what remains of his inner circle. Without their capital, without their factories and without their leader, the Accelerated Department has now been utterly defeated. Victory is ours."
 sichuan_events.97.a: "We stand triumphant."

 sichuan_events.98.t: "Disaster in Beipei"
 sichuan_events.98.d: "Relying upon Deng and Tian's forces, Baoding marched towards Chongqing, aiming to take the city from Liu Xiang while also fighting against the various insurgents and bandits without Liu Wenhui's support. Predicting this move, Liu Xiang was able to order a portion of his main force to move to intercept his adversary's advancing army without needing to worry about the Chengdu siege being broken. Thanks in no small part to persistent harassment by insurgents, Baoding's forces were slowed down significantly, allowing elements of Wang Lingji's reserves from Chongqing to mobilise while Liu Xiang chased the Baoding army. This eventually led to them being caught in a pincer between the two advancing Accelerated armies near the city of Beipei, just north of Chongqing. A desperate defence was to follow.\n\nSurrounded and cut off, the Baoding army was in a terrible position. The areas around the city did not provide any good defensive positions, made even worse by a terrible supply situation. Skilled though he may be, Huang Yin only had hours to prepare anything resembling a defence. The task presented to him was simply impossible given his own dire situation and the enemy's superiority. The Baoding forces bravely stood their ground, but after less than an hour of actual fighting the makeshift defences had crumbled under the combined assaults mounted by Liu Xiang's army. With the permission of Deng Xihou, the bulk of the soldiers and their officers surrendered soon thereafter, not wanting to cast their lives away for an unwinnable battle."
 sichuan_events.98.a: "It's all over now..."

 sichuan_events.99.t: "Liu Wenhui Retreats to Xikang"
 sichuan_events.99.d: "Part of being a good officer is to realise when you've been beaten and retreat while there's still a chance to save the lives of your soldiers. Though the Beipei catastrophe had marked the end of any effective resistance by the main Baoding army, their defence against the unexpected pincer move had allowed him to escape with a retinue of his closest men. It was a close call and he only narrowly evaded capture first by the advancing soldiers of Liu Xiang's army as he fled westward.\n\nWhile he is rallying his remaining forces in the relative safety of Xikang's mountains, Chengdu and its defenders are on their own."
 sichuan_events.99.a: "At least he made it out in one piece."

 sichuan_events.100.t: "Deng Xihou Surrenders"
 sichuan_events.100.d: "As Liu Xiang's vanguard headed back north to continue their siege of Chengdu in full force, it the Baoding Department has decided to accept the inevitable. With Huang Yin's forces defeated, Deng Xihou knows he has no chance to overcome the combined Accelerated Department forces and that continuing the fight would merely cause the needless deaths of his own soldiers and the people behind the walls of Chengdu. As a result, Deng sent out an emissary to Liu Xiang's field headquarters outside of Chengdu to ask for a ceasefire. Given his poor bargaining position, the only thing he asks in exchange for Chengdu's peaceful transfer over to Liu Xiang is for the safe passage out of Sichuan for Deng and the Baoding leadership. Liu Xiang, knowing that a ruined city and high casualties wouldn't help him unite the country still beset by petty warlords and guerrillas, was quick to accept and honour the deal.\n\nAlthough Chengdu's walls still stand, the gates were opened for the triumphant soldiers of the Accelerated Department. At this point, most citizens of Chengdu are only relieved that the war may be over soon and that they were spared a direct assault."
 sichuan_events.100.a: "So it ends. Or begins?"

 sichuan_events.101.t: "Governor Xiao Invades Enshi"
 sichuan_events.101.d: "The region of Shihe, in Southwestern Hubei, formerly controlled by [SZC.GetNameDef], has been split between de-jure and de-facto governorship ever since the conclusion of fighting in Western China following the Xuantong Restoration. Incensed by this, Hubei Governor Xiao Yaonan has consistently petitioned the Central Government to act, and seize the territory as the rightful lands of Hubei. However, this has never come to fruition, for the Government valued stability and goodwill with Yang Sen rather than instigation.\n\nFollowing the collapse of Qing authority however, the region has been seized by Governor Xiao Yaonan's forces in an independent rogue act. He managed to overwhelm the local [SZC.GetAdjective] garrisons, and has gained a valuable prize for his position within the Zhili clique. The Accelerated Department have been reported to have organised some sort of futile resistance against the Zhili Clique's large army and Sichuan has already sent divisions to try and take back the region, but Xiao Yaonan's forces have been able to fight them off with relative ease so far."
 sichuan_events.101.a: "He can't defeat an entire clique by himself!"

 sichuan_events.102.d: "The region of Shihe, in Southwestern Hubei, formerly controlled by [SZC.GetNameDef], has been split between de-jure and de-facto governorship ever since the conclusion of fighting in Western China following the Xuantong Restoration. Incensed by this, Hubei Governor Xiao Yaonan has consistently petitioned the Central Government to act, and seize the territory as the rightful lands of Hubei. However, this has never come to fruition, for the Government valued stability and goodwill with Yang Sen rather than instigation.\n\nSeeing the opportunity, Xiao Yaonan has invaded southwestern Hubei. Establishing a temporary occupation in the city of Enshi, his forces have routed the local garrisons and are on the move. Divisions have already been sent to the provincial border and heavy fighting has broken out between Liu Xiang's forces and the forces of the Zhili army."
 sichuan_events.102.a: "Liu Xiang manages to fend the Zhili off!"
 sichuan_events.102.b: "Liu Xiang's campaign is defeated!"

 sichuan_events.103.t: "Assault on Enshi"
 sichuan_events.103.d: "The forces of General Liu Xiang in Shihe have failed their assault on the town of Enshi. With [SZC.GetAdjective] soldiers tired out and outnumbered, a retreat was ordered and the Zhili moved in to re-occupy the lands they had lost in the Accelerated Department offensive. During the [SZC.GetAdjective] retreat, many men were lost on the road as the Zhili made a vicious attack on the retreating forces."
 sichuan_events.103.a: "A brilliant success Xiao!"

 sichuan_events.104.t: "The Battle of Enshi"
 sichuan_events.104.d: "After Liu Xiang's forces successfully flanked and encircled the town of Enshi, the Zhili's presence in Hubei collapsed. Pushing them back to the [QIE.GetAdjective] border, General Liu Xiang was hugely successful in retaking and occupying Hubei. Zhili presence has been mostly wiped out from the region, with small pockets of panicked soldiers trying to make their way back to the main force that was occupying Enshi."
 sichuan_events.104.a: "You cost us gravely for acting rogue!"

 sichuan_events.120.t: "Drought?"
 sichuan_events.120.d: "Just over a decade ago in 1925 a great famine wracked Sichuan province. Hundreds of thousands died and just as many fled the province. Exacerbated by the internecine warfare of that era, the famine was sparked by a long-lasting drought and caused irreparable economic and financial damage to Sichuan. For the last ten years the farmers that survived the drought hurriedly pray whenever the sun stays in the sky for over a week - but it appears their prayers have gone unanswered this year. Rain has not fallen in the province for over a month and many are fearing a return to the catastrophe of 1925..."
 sichuan_events.120.a: "The rain must come soon..."

 sichuan_events.121.t: "Transport Links Severed"
 sichuan_events.121.d: "With fears of a famine already high after the drought refused to let up, many in [SZC.GetLeader]'s inner circle advised stockpiling rice imported down the Yangtze. Now, however, that plan has been cast aside. High tides, caused by unusually large glacial melts in the mountains, prevented any river trade from reaching Chengdu this year and the ongoing chaos in the League has largely cut off all railroad trade from the Legation ports where food is imported to. With Yunnan's government taking more and more overtly hostile action towards us, the only route to a port is through the Liangguang clique. While the route is stable, they aren't exactly close friends of ours and we may be cut off from *any* international trade soon."
 sichuan_events.121.a: "We need an alternative route, now!"

 sichuan_events.122.t: "Rice Prices Spike"
 sichuan_events.122.d: "With imports into our province becoming more and more scarce and public fears of a famine rising with every sunny day, marketplaces across Sichuan have widespread increases in food prices. Already, this has sparked riots and demonstrations from small mountain villages to Chengdu itself. Those who can afford it have started to leave the province, with most heading towards the relative safety of the north."
 sichuan_events.122.a: "As if the war weren't a large enough problem!"

 sichuan_events.123.t: "Famine!"
 sichuan_events.123.d: "Our worst fears have come to pass - the looming threat of famine is now reality. The drought and the unrest in the League cutting off most of our import have created a perfect storm of misery and chaos as former neighbours turn on each other over scraps of food and officials across the province report mass food riots, looting, deaths from starvation. Public order has broken down as policemen become too weak with hunger to stop criminals and refugees stream out of the province through whatever means they can. If rains do not fall soon total anarchy is inevitable."
 sichuan_events.123.a: "Not again!"

 sichuan_events.124.t: "Famine Breaks Out in Sichuan"
 sichuan_events.124.d: "The province of Sichuan has long struggled with famine. Rocky terrain and unpredictable weather kept populations low until the early Qing era, when widespread land clearances and immigration incentives brought hordes of peasants to the province. In 1925 a lengthy drought turned into a devastating famine that ravaged the province, leading to hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of refugees.\n\nNow, with chaos in the League disrupting food shipments and another lengthy drought the spectre of famine haunts Sichuan once more. Already horrifying stories are emerging of mothers selling their children into slavery for scraps of bread and anarchy gripping even the richest market towns."
 sichuan_events.124.a: "This year just keeps getting worse!"

 sichuan_events.125.t: "Rains Return to Sichuan"
 sichuan_events.125.d: "[SZC.GetLeader] was hunched over his desk desperately writing letter after letter to [GXC.GetLeader] to negotiate importing rice when he heard it. It started as the occasional droplet, but within minutes [SZC.GetLeader] heard the steady drumming of rain on the roof of his building. Scarcely believing it, he ran outside and was almost immediately drenched. Around him his soldiers celebrated and even the normally dour-faced guards to the Governor's mansion were practically dancing with joy.\n\nWhile it will take a while to grow a new crop of food, the rain will help calm down the peasantry and put a stop to the anarchy gripping most of the province."
 sichuan_events.125.a: "Blessed rain!"

 sichuan_events.127.t: "The Famine Fades"
 sichuan_events.127.d: "As more and more of the Sichuanese agricultural sector recovers its productivity, the dark cloud of famine has been steadily receding from the province. More and more farms have begun to increase their output, while the devastation of the civil war continues to fade from public memory. We may never know the full extent of the damage, but even so it certainly appears that we'll soon be able to declare an official end to the famine.\n\nNonetheless, with millions of our citizens dead from this catastrophe, the famine has left an indelible dark mark upon Sichuan, one that will take decades to fully remove. Even now, many areas are still in a limbo of sorts, with the grain supply still unsteady. As our first step, we must work to fully solve the lingering famine pockets."
 sichuan_events.127.a: "An end to a dark era."

 sichuan_events.128.t: "Sichuan petitions the Central Government"
 sichuan_events.128.d.zhili: "As if things couldn't get any worse, the Sichuanese government recently informed us that the drought that has gripped their province for the last month is now a full-blown famine, with social order breaking down as food becomes increasingly scarce. Subsequently, they have petitioned our government for aid. While we do have more pressing concerns to attend do, the province is of critical importance to our regime and ensuring the loyalty of their government will be key in reuniting China."
 sichuan_events.128.d.manchu: "Although our new government lacks recognition from many of the warlords surrounding it, the Sichuanese provincial administration of [SZC.GetLeader] recently reached out to our government asking for aid. This is a great opportunity to show that we are the new 'legitimate' government of China. The agricultural ministries, however, are still reeling from the shock of the coup and may take time to prepare the aid required to help Sichuan."
 sichuan_events.128.a: "Order the ministries to send aid."
 sichuan_events.128.b: "We have other concerns."

 sichuan_events.129.t: "Ministerial Infighting!"
 sichuan_events.129.d: "As is typical for Beijing, our order to the various ministries of agriculture sparked an intense war of contract bidding, bureaucratic infighting and general inaction that typifies the lackadaisical Beijing government apparatus. One example today particularly exemplifies this corruption: sacks of rice have been assembled in Beijing, but a dispute over which rail company is to actually ship them to Chendu sparked a week-long series of negotiations involving kickbacks, bribes and bizarrely, accusations that one company's owner was a homosexual. While lots of money is changing hands, only a few grains of rice have actually made it to the hands of the starving peasantry of Sichuan."
 sichuan_events.129.a: "Get on with it!"

 sichuan_events.130.t: "Continued Ministerial Infighting"
 sichuan_events.130.d.zhili: "It appears the various agriculture ministries are still yet to actually deliver any of the food they have collected in Beijing. Sacks of grain sit rotting in warehouses across the city as the peasantry of Sichuan starve and Yang Sen's situation grows ever more tenuous by the day. Wu Peifu has devised a solution to get things moving - by threatening to fire the heads of the various ministries, Wu hopes he can light a fire under their chairs and push them into action. As always, however, this comes with a cost. Wu would have to spend political capital he can spend elsewhere in the government on reassuring the various patron networks backing the ministries that these threats are not *actually* serious. Or are they?"
 sichuan_events.130.d.manchu: "It appears the various agriculture ministries are still yet to actually deliver any of the food they have collected in Beijing. Sacks of grain sit rotting in warehouses across the city as the peasantry of Sichuan starve. The new government has an opportunity to flex their muscles by threatening to fire the ministers in charge of food distribution - but this would be costly."

 sichuan_events.130.b: "Let them keep squabbling..."

 sichuan_events.131.t: "Famine relief from Beijing"
 sichuan_events.131.d: "While we were worried by the lack of trains from Beijing following our request for aid - their daily telegraphs that it was 'on its way' hardly relieving concerns - it seems they were able to whip the notoriously byzantine agriculture and aid ministries into some semblance of action. Even though some of the promised sacks of rice were less than full - no doubt skimmed by some salacious official - we've received enough food to temporarily alleviate the worst of the chaos."
 sichuan_events.131.a: "Finally!"

 sichuan_events.132.t: "Beijing Ignores our Petition"
 sichuan_events.132.d.zhili: "While Yang had hoped his old ally Wu Peifu would come to his aid in this moment of need, it appears the Jade Marshal has larger fish to fry. While he telegraphed Yang a sympathetic note, he claimed that the ongoing chaos in the former League of Eight Provinces robbed him of any resources available for famine relief."
 sichuan_events.132.d.manchu: "While we had always feared that the government in Beijing would ignore our requests, those fears proved well-warranted today when [QIE.GetLeader] formally informed us that he could not supply the necessary aid to counter our famine. Many suspect this is due to our 'warlord' loyalties and already [SZC.GetLeader]'s position looks increasingly tenuous by the day."
 sichuan_events.132.a: "We shall remember this!"

 sichuan_events.133.t: "CERA Congratulates the Government"
 sichuan_events.133.d: "Few groups within the Assembly loathe the Harmony Association and the Zhili more than the CERA. Comprised of naive intellectuals, they frequently protest the 'warlord nature' of our government and claim we are simply corrupt kleptocrats more interested in robbing the peasantry than developing the nation. Following our promise to aid [SZC.GetLeader] and stop the famine gripping his province, however, they publicly praised our 'surprising display of compassion for the peasantry of China'.\n\nNobody in the HA is really sure if they are naive enough to believe we are doing this to actually help the peasantry, but the support is certainly better than their usual loud protests."
 sichuan_events.133.a: "Thanks, I guess?"

 sichuan_events.134.t: "CERA Criticises the Government"
 sichuan_events.134.d: "Our decision to turn down Governor [SZC.GetLeader]'s request for aid was met with mostly silence - until today. The CERA - nominally the party of the 'peasantry' but really little more than a group of rich philanthropists convinced they can save China's peasantry by throwing their father's money at their problems - loudly denounced our inaction. This is certainly not unusual, as they seem to protest nearly everything we do. What, however, is unusual is the fact that people are starting to pay attention to them. While their protest pamphlets are normally only distributed in the cities, soldiers across our territory have reported seeing pamphlets denouncing the 'warlords that let their own people starve in the streets' in every city and village of our nation!"

A consortium of wealthy philanthropists in the Legation Cities have convened to organise the 'China International Famine Relief Commission' (CIFRC). While most of them are helping out desire more for international recognition Western cash is desperately needed to buy food for our starving peasants, as the leaders of the surrounding warlord cliques, recognising our predicament, have jacked up prices. Hopefully these wealthy westerners can help save Sichuan!"

 sichuan_events.151.t: "Famine in the North"
 sichuan_events.151.d: "While news of a famine in the province of Sichuan had already reached Guangzhou before them, an official delegation from the troubled province arrived today. After meeting privately with [ROOT.GetLeader], they pleaded for [GXC.GetNameDef]'s support. Armed with moving words with a hint of desperation, coupled with disturbing photographic evidence, they made their case before both the Guangdong Provincial Assemblies in hopes of rallying support for their cause. They also brought witness testimonies from the famine, and their vivid descriptions of the famine painted an image of human suffering far beyond what any newspaper headline could convey.\n\nTheir powerful appeals for compassion, national unity, and charity from the wealthy Cantonese elite meet hardened hearts however. Liangguang is no stranger to war and suffering, and the upheaval that recently gripped Liangguang has left the province with few resources to spare. Still, the murmurings of dissent indicate there is plenty of room for argument as the topic is brought to the floor for debate."
 sichuan_events.151.a: "This ought to be an interesting discussion."

 sichuan_events.154.t: "Chen Lianbo's Personal Donation"
 sichuan_events.154.d: "The wealthy Cantonese businessman doubled-down on his earlier statements to the Guangdong Provincial Assembly by making a huge private donation for relief to Sichuan along with many of his friends among the Cantonese elite. Making true his reputation as a philanthropist, Chen still warned that private donations, even from wealthy donors such as himself, could not compare to the potential relief the Guangdong Provincial Government could provide. His statement was a clear message to the elected representatives of the Provincial Assembly, even if the more pessimistic shrugged it off as a mere publicity stunt from a wealthy public figure."
 sichuan_events.154.a: "Thanks, friend."

 sichuan_events.155.t: "The Provincial Assembly Votes"
 sichuan_events.155.d: "Emotions ran high during the debates. Sceptics were quick to criticise the Sichuan provincial government that allowed for the situation to worsen so much and the intense factional disputes there. While few could argue about the morality of sending aid, it was clear that Sichuan was not only suffering from famine, but from endemic corruption, which could very-well make any relief effort a complete waste. Moreover, with Guangdong military spending skyrocketing and their own future in question, there is little appetite for additional expenditures. Some snarked that the representatives from Sichuan ought to ask the so-called \"central government\" in the north to fulfil their responsibility, or even ask the Guangxi Provincial Assembly for their charity.\n\nProponents of the bill received a substantial boost when Chen Lianbo, a prominent Cantonese businessman and well-known philanthropist who became Mayor of the city in 1928, strongly endorsed the proposal. To add pressure on the assembly to act, he and other leading merchants created a private relief fund for the beleaguered province but warned that private donations alone could not help stave off the crisis. Given his controversial tenure as Mayor, some question if his latest charitable endeavour is sincere but what is beyond question is his money is real. With both sides having stated their case, it seems things are heading to a conclusion."
 sichuan_events.155.a: "The relief bill passes."
 sichuan_events.155.b: "The relief bill fails."

 sichuan_events.158.t: "Aid Arrives from Guangdong"
 sichuan_events.158.d: "The first shipment of aid from the Province of Guangdong finally arrived. Not only thanks to the private donations of many wealthy individuals in the province, but the Provincial Government's own relief fund will be able to help alleviate the crisis in Sichuan."
 sichuan_events.158.a: "Good news, at last!"

 sichuan_events.159.t: "No Aid from Guangdong"
 sichuan_events.159.d: "Despite our pleas, the Guangdong Provincial Assembly refused to allocate funds for famine relief to Sichuan. Their public refusal to send aid has sent a message not only to us, but to all of China, about the state of morality in wealthy Guangzhou and the provincial democracy they brag about so much."
 sichuan_events.159.a: "We'll remember this!"

 sichuan_events.160.t: "The Clay Eaters"
 sichuan_events.160.d: "The starvation crisis is reaching disturbing proportions in the countryside. Just like in 1925, some villagers with nothing else to turn to have started to dig up clay from the ground in a desperate bid to sate their hunger. Tragically, this has only led to sickness and more misery. We've instructed local administrators and police to inform the people on the dangers of resorting to these measures, though with the situation being what it is these warnings are likely to fall on deaf ears."
 sichuan_events.160.a: "That won't help matters!"

 sichuan_events.161.t: "Rice Riots"
 sichuan_events.161.d: "The scuffles and shouting matches following the price spikes earlier in the year are nothing compared to the displays that often haunt the major cities of Sichuan. All too often when bags of rice arrive in the markets, fights break out over them. Allegations of hoarding, price rigging and other malicious practices are rife and sadly, not inaccurate a lot of the time. With anger fuming among the hungry citizenry of the cities, we've been forced to deploy military police in the cities to maintain order and prevent, or at least mitigate any future outbreaks of violence and vandalism. This is hardly a permanent solution though as the presence of what some may see as uniformed thugs is likely to cause tensions and discontent to rise even further if we can't solve these shortages."
 sichuan_events.161.a: "We need this crisis solved, now!"

 sichuan_events.162.t: "Violence in the Markets"
 sichuan_events.162.d: "The merchants in the cities are often bearing the brunt of the anger that the desperate food shortages in the cities have caused. Shouts that they're famine profiteers and food hoarders are rampant, with many of them being attacked in the broad daylight of the marketplaces. Sometimes, even the rumour of a merchant withholding bags of rice for himself is enough to cause them to be attacked, only for the rioters to find out all too late that the store they sacked was as empty as their stomachs. This has led to several stores and markets closing down out of fear for more violence, which has only had the effect of making food even harder to come by. If the merchants weren't hoarding their last few bags of rice before, they certainly are now. Extra police have been deployed to handle these situations, but the damage has already been done."
 sichuan_events.162.a: "Can this crisis get any worse?"

 sichuan_events.163.t: "Unusual Solutions"
 sichuan_events.163.d: "Eating grass, leaves and berries has become commonplace around Sichuan as people, especially in the countryside, have started to take to rather unorthodox solutions to feed themselves in lieu of any other alternatives. Many are turning to more outlandish solutions though, with various flora and fauna commonly regarded as inedible being used as substitutes for food. The creative solutions are sometimes almost as disturbing as the crisis itself and though having something to eat is better than having nothing to eat, this only underscores the urgency in getting proper relief out to the hungry masses."
 sichuan_events.163.a: "We'll need to monitor this development."

 sichuan_events.164.t: "Spike in Poisoning Cases"
 sichuan_events.164.d: "The recent rise in makeshift solutions to the famine has led to tragic yet predictable results, despite our best efforts to spread awareness of the risks these practices bring with them. Hospitals and rural clinics are seeing a large increase in patients suffering from acute cases of poisoning, assuming they're even able to make it there in the first place. With our medical services being pressed to their limits, local administrators have been tasked with informing their people on the dangers of these activities. As long as the famine endures though, cases aren't likely to stop occurring."
 sichuan_events.164.a: "We should've acted faster."

 sichuan_events.165.t: "Child Poverty Rises"
 sichuan_events.165.d: "Poverty has sadly been a companion to most of Sichuan throughout our history. With the famine sweeping the nation, it's only gotten worse as families already on the brink have been hit hard by this crisis. Where before there was scarcity, now there's hardly anything for them at all. Without any safety net in hard times, the youngest are some of the worst affected by this."
 sichuan_events.165.a: "Sichuan can't take much more of this!"

 sichuan_events.166.t: "The Abandoned Children"
 sichuan_events.166.d: "Because of the terrible conditions gripping the province recently, there's been a massive increase in abandoned children being left to fend for themselves. Sometimes it's because their parents simply have no means to feed their families, although often the tragic reason is that they aren't even in the picture any more. With thousands of cases like this already and many more appearing every day, the people are pleading that the government takes action to help the children of the province."
 sichuan_events.166.a: "We *must* help them. No one else will."

 sichuan_events.167.t: "Children of the Famine"
 sichuan_events.167.d: "The worst hit by the famine have been the children of Sichuan. With food being scarce and disorder being rampant, no one's spared from the effects of the famine. Worst hit of all are the children with the tragic tales being too many to count. We cannot stand for this. Together with our international relief partners we've established a special government operation to safeguard them and our future. This includes everything from special allocations of food and other aid resources to prevent future tragedies, all the way up to providing shelter and orphanages in the cases where tragedy has already struck.\n\nThese are small and costly steps on the road to recovery from the famine, but it's worth every effort to let our people know that no matter what, the children of our province will not be forced to fend for themselves."
 sichuan_events.167.a: "We take care of our own."

 sichuan_events.168.t: "Refugees Flee the Province"
 sichuan_events.168.d: "Seeing no future in Sichuan, people are fleeing the province in their thousands for the literal greener pastures to the north, south and east. Several smaller villages have been turned into ghost towns due to the massive number of people leaving them. Unless we put a quick end to this disastrous famine, this will only be the first wave out of many."

 sichuan_events.170.d: "It's a tale as old as time itself. Whether it's a crate of relief goods that simply disappeared or a colonel requesting food rations for regiments that only exist on paper, the chaos in the country has opened the doors for a lot of shameless individuals to take something extra for themselves. Whether it's desperation or greed, we cannot stand for any of this. More efforts need to be taken to root out this kind of thievery."
 sichuan_events.170.a: "Seriously? Stealing from starving peasants?"

 sichuan_events.171.t: "Corruption Delays Relief Efforts"
 sichuan_events.171.d: "Recently there have been reports of soldiers and officials extorting people for bribes in order to allow aid shipments to pass through, calling it a toll fee or something similarly disingenuous. An order has been issued that anyone caught engaging in these kinds of activities will have disciplinary actions taken against them. That should get them to think twice before attempting to earn a few coins this way."

 sichuan_events.172.t: "Black Market on Foodstuffs"
 sichuan_events.172.d: "With a bag of rice being worth its weight in gold, smuggling food has become a lucrative business for criminal syndicates and ruthless opium farmers alike. Some are using hoarded resources and selling them at a premium to desperate people across Sichuan while more brazen criminals simply steal the food relief packages to sell on the black market. The police are doing everything they can to combat this shameless criminality, but their efforts are so far coming up short in eliminating the problem altogether."
 sichuan_events.172.a: "More profiteering off the suffering?"

 sichuan_events.173.t: "KMT Raids on Food Shipments"
 sichuan_events.173.d: "China is hardly a stranger to war and although we recently concluded our civil war, conflicts are still gripping China. In a worrying new trend, some of our international aid shipments have been raided by Kuomintang guerrillas. While we have yet to determine if they're from Yunnan, Guangxi or even the Left Kuomintang fighting in what used to be the League of Eight Provinces, we need to step up security to prevent these actions from happening in the future."
 sichuan_events.173.a: "Now this is just ridiculous."

 sichuan_events.174.t: "Prayers for Rain"
 sichuan_events.174.d: "Whether driven by genuine belief or if he simply wished to instil hope in a despairing public, Liu Xiang has gathered several religious leaders from across the province to pray for rains to come back to Sichuan and put an end to the drought. While it's certainly a nice display, it's hardly done anything to help matters on the ground as days after the prayers were called there still isn't a cloud in the skies, let alone rain."
 sichuan_events.174.a: "This isn't helping!"

 sichuan_events.175.t: "Dujiangyan, Damaged"
 sichuan_events.175.d: "During the civil the Dujiangyan system for irrigating the area around the Baopingkou Channel was tampered with, causing a flooding meant to repulse Liu Xiang's forces without having to fight them in the field. It turns out, however, that by taking the easy route that day we've made the famine situation worse for ourselves. The operation by our engineers caused lasting damages that have now caused the channel to dry up. Without any means or irrigating the area, a drought has stricken the nearby fields, worsening an already dire situation. We have no one to blame for this ordeal but ourselves and we must now take responsibility for our actions."

James Yen, a leading intellectual in Beijing and a leader of the Chinese Empire Reform Association, as well as the mastermind of the Rural Reconstruction Movement. We have just received a missive from Yen, stating his desire to help with the famine relief efforts. To that end, his Rural Reconstruction Movement has made a hefty donation to our relief efforts, and more aid is to come."
 sichuan_events.176.a: "Thanks, friend."

 sichuan_events.200.t: "Affairs of the Red Basin"
 sichuan_events.200.d: "The Sichuan Basin, also named the Red Basin for the red sandstone lining the soil, is currently in a sorry state. The hilly region boasts some of China's most fertile land, as well as ample avenues for irrigation and terrace farming. However, the last decades have not been kind to the province. A succession of inept governments since the late Qing era has left the province stagnated and isolated relative to the Chinese economy.\n\nIn the last three decades, cultivation of opium has become perhaps Sichuan's largest and most important economic sector, due to the high profits obtainable from the growth of the poppy. Opium brings much wealth, but it is also a major problem due to its effects on the population. Its unregulated growth was one of the causes of the Famine and also a source of conflict due to both criminal associations and even the Sichuanese warlords attempting to control the trade.\n\nBefore we can even start to work on improving our economy, we must decide the fate of the opium industry. The status quo is unsustainable, but there are a few options we could choose..."

 sichuan_events.201.t: "Assessing the Spread of Opium"
 sichuan_events.201.d: "Sichuan can make the claim of being the world's largest producer and consumer of opium with thousands of tons of the plant being cultivated within our borders every years. It's often said that Sichuan is the very rotten core of the Chinese opium crisis and has been ever since the Anglo-Chinese wars of the 19th century. Given the enormity of the scale of both the production and consumption of opium that takes places in Sichuan, no one is under any illusions that this will be a tremendously difficult task to tackle."
 sichuan_events.201.a: "It must be done."

 sichuan_events.202.t: "The Scale of Corruption"
 sichuan_events.202.d: "From top to bottom, every segment of Sichuanese society is affected by the opium trade and its associated vices, to the point where the everyday functions of government and society are impaired. For instance, a soldier being paid in opium while his commander pockets his wages is an alarmingly common practice. Not only does this foster corruption and bad morale within the army, but as our recent civil war tragically proved, widespread opium addiction within the ranks led to needless deaths and suffering on all sides of the conflict. Similar practices are seen in other branches of the government, from local mayors enriching themselves through the drug trade, all the way down to petty bureaucrats accepting bribes and harassing the local population. Even the common man in Sichuan isn't immune to the temptations of this corruption, despite more often than not being merely its victim.\n\nWe have to come to terms with the daunting fact that corruption infests every facet of our society - from top to bottom - with hardly a single entity in Sichuan being spared from it. We have a long and hard road ahead of us if we are to curb this problem."
 sichuan_events.202.a: "It's *that* bad?!"

 sichuan_events.203.t: "Addiction to Opium"
 sichuan_events.203.d: "The scourge of opium is so widespread in Sichuan that it's part of every-day life in the province. Its effects can be seen wherever you look, from the people in the streets that cast away their lives over it to the very top of society. No one is spared from its consequences. It's truly a sign of the times that sights that would've shocked anyone throughout most of history is seen as part of the daily routine in Sichuan."
 sichuan_events.203.a: "We'll need to deal with this sooner or later."

 sichuan_events.204.t: "A Plan Against Opium"
 sichuan_events.204.d: "The commission tasked with stamping out the opium abuse and profiteering in Sichuan has started to draft plans for the monumental task of ridding Sichuan from this blight. The measures proposed point towards a difficult road ahead with even the most optimistic projections suggesting that this will be an incredibly costly and hard-fought endeavour.\n\nSome of the lighter measures include reforms and rather conventional anti-corruption measures. The commission also insists on the urgency to rehabilitate addicts and force them off their dependency, something that will burden our healthcare system. A representative of the army was also present at the meeting and laid out plans for what they can do by aiding the police's efforts in curtailing production and smuggling, although some of their methods may be a bit heavy-handed.\n\nIt's a long road ahead for us. Let's see this one through to the end."
 sichuan_events.204.a: "Let's get started."

 sichuan_events.205.t: "Rise of the Black Market"
 sichuan_events.205.d: "As soon as the government began its initiative to crack down on opium addiction an inevitable side-effect was an explosion in opium prices and the rise of a black market. Already this underground economy is one of the larger in Sichuan in terms of GDP, all of which goes straight to the pockets of the criminals. The price hike is also sure to cause immense hardships for the addicts in Sichuan's population unless we intervene and provide them with the help they need. Breaking the black market should, however, be our utmost priority."
 sichuan_events.205.a: "They are thugs and shall be dealt with."

 sichuan_events.206.t.delays: "Our Efforts Are Delayed"
 sichuan_events.206.d.delays: "With opium becoming worth its weight in gold thanks to the supply being pushed underground, there's a lot of money to be made in turning a blind eye to it. Officials routinely 'forget' to report opium being transported through their districts as the temptation of getting a cut from the black market is often all too tempting. Without stricter measures against administrative corruption, these issues are unlikely to go away."
 sichuan_events.206.t.bribery: "Bribery Scandal"
 sichuan_events.206.d.bribery: "A major scandal has rocked our army. Several military officials tasked with overseeing the eradication of opium fields have been arrested for distributing the seized opium stocks they were meant to destroy. Under their command, conscripts were also paid in opium packages while the money meant to pay for their salaries went straight into the pockets of the officers. They'll be dealt with harshly, but as long as there's money to be gained from corruption this isn't likely to be the last case of this kind."
 sichuan_events.206.t.no_enforcement: "Lack of Law Enforcement"
 sichuan_events.206.d.no_enforcement: "It's no secret that a crate of opium can fetch a police officer's yearly salary. They're only human and as such a lot of previously honest police have been caught taking bribes or even participating in smuggling operations as middlemen. The most common practice though is that of officers simply not reporting what they see and turning a blind eye to things, all in exchange for money and drugs. It seems that we need to step up our efforts to straighten out our police force. If they falter, so will our anti-opium efforts."
 sichuan_events.206.a: "How deep can this go?!"

 sichuan_events.207.t: "Start of the Anti-Corruption Campaign"
 sichuan_events.207.d: "The efforts to stamp out corruption are already bearing fruit. Though arrests and convictions are few so far, we've made it known that no one is safe from the long arm of the law. The serious threat of being thrown into a dungeon if caught is forcing a lot of these spineless cowards to comply and do their jobs. Slowly but surely, the bureaucracies are being brought in line with the rest of our anti-opium initiative."
 sichuan_events.207.a: "We shall root them out, one by one if need be!"

 sichuan_events.208.t: "Corruption In The Civil Service"
 sichuan_events.208.d: "Even our administration isn't safe from the temptation of making a quick buck in the wake of the war on opium. Embezzlement, theft and bribery is running rampant with several quite embarrassing arrests already having been made. There's still a lot that needs to be done to rid our administration of these weak-willed two-bit criminals, it seems."
 sichuan_events.208.a: "How did this become so huge?!"

 sichuan_events.209.t: "Corruption In The Army"
 sichuan_events.209.d: "Large parts of our army has long suffered from a poor reputation for a widespread lack of professionalism. A lot of this pertains to opium with a large portion of our force being addicts that are often covertly paid in opium while their commanding officers pocket their requisitioned wages. These practices have long been tacitly accepted, but when we announced our anti-opium initiative they could hardly expect to be made exempt from the law. This has already caused problems both with soldiers and officers. The generals are going to have a hard time sorting out this mess."
 sichuan_events.209.a: "Even in the army?!"

 sichuan_events.210.t: "Smugglers In The Administration"
 sichuan_events.210.d: "With the amount of money to be made from opium smuggling it was inevitable that officials in our administration would give in to the temptation of money. Already many lower and even middle-ranking officials have been put behind bars for aiding smuggling efforts in the countryside, usually by taking bribes in exchange for letting smuggling operations go unhindered. It seems that no matter how many we catch, there's always more corrupt officials behind every corner."
 sichuan_events.210.a: "You can't break the law if you *are* the law, apparently."

 sichuan_events.211.t.committee: "Opium Committee Involved in Smuggling"
 sichuan_events.211.d.committee: "In what may be the biggest embarrassment for the committee yet, a ranking member of it was caught red-handed in a police sting operation. The now former official had been taking large bribes in exchange for reporting that operations that didn't even take place were in fact successful, which in some cases led to resources being diverted from much-needed law enforcement in the region. While the arrest is a positive development, the fact that it happened at all has humiliated the committee."
 sichuan_events.211.t.bureau: "Sales Bureau Involved in Smuggling"
 sichuan_events.211.d.bureau: "Several members of the state sales bureau have been arrested today after being caught cutting deals with the smugglers. This has not only harmed our efforts to establish a healthy state monopoly in this business, but it has also led to large sums of opium going untaxed right under our noses. Those arrested now faces long jail sentences while we're forced to increase our efforts against the smugglers if we are to regain our market share."
 sichuan_events.211.a: "Now this is just plain ridiculous!"

 sichuan_events.212.t: "Political Murders"
 sichuan_events.212.d: "As the saying goes, if you're above the target, they'll fire at you. With their market share shrinking thanks to the efforts of our law enforcement, military and administration, a sad reality is that the criminals will retaliate against us. Today two officials that had been stalwart fighters against corruption were assassinated in broad daylight by hired thugs. The criminals soon joined them thanks to our police, but it shows that the smugglers are ready to stop at nothing to win this war."
 sichuan_events.212.a: "They must be getting desperate!"

 sichuan_events.213.t: "Opium Fades"
 sichuan_events.213.d: "The efforts to tackle opium have finally yielded significant results. Though the fight has been tough and a lot of hardships have been endured, the role opium is playing in the Sichuanese economy has started to diminish. Addicts in the streets are becoming a scarcer sight and the debauchery associated with the opium dens is now gradually being phased out of society. Slowly but surely, we're winning this fight."
 sichuan_events.213.a: "We can't stop now!"

 sichuan_events.214.t: "Rising Grain Production"
 sichuan_events.214.d: "Opium as a crop is very labour-intensive, requiring huge amounts of work, resources and attention to cultivate. With the amount of opium being produced in Sichuan, a massive portion of our province's arable lands were devoted to opium production. With the growth of opium likely to lead to a jail sentence or worse, however, fewer and fewer farmers are growing it these days. This is a positive development as it has led to a gradual but significant increase in food crops being grown by our farmers. From having endured a famine not long ago, we may not be far from an agricultural boom."
 sichuan_events.214.a: "Never another famine!"

 sichuan_events.215.t: "Tax Evasion Discovered"
 sichuan_events.215.d: "Sichuan has long had a problem with corruption. In large part caused by a dysfunctional government split between various warlords, a relic from those times is that tax collection has been very ineffective. Only 10-20% of what's collected seem to end up in [SZC.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], while the rest is lost to waste and fraud along the way."

 sichuan_events.216.t: "Tax Evasion Increases Enormously"
 sichuan_events.216.d: "The plans to monopolise and tax opium has proven to not only be wildly unpopular, but it's also facing stiff resistance. Tax evasion, already a big problem before, has exploded since we put our plans into effect. As resistance to taxation comes from every level of society and not just a handful of dejected merchants, this will be a tremendous hurdle to overcome if our monopoly is to gain legitimacy."
 sichuan_events.216.a: "Get rid of those parasites!"

 sichuan_events.217.t: "Merchants Revolt Against Our Policies"
 sichuan_events.217.d: "Many of Sichuan's largest merchant houses and farm owners are beginning to mount stiff resistance against our monopoly. With their combined resources, they hold a very significant power base in the country through their economic influence alone. This has allowed them to actively defy our newly imposed rules and taxes. In hindsight, we should probably have expected them to put up this kind of fight when faced with the prospect of being parted from their ill-gotten gains. We have no choice but to fight fire with fire on this one."
 sichuan_events.217.a: "Together or alone, they'll be crushed all the same."

 sichuan_events.218.t: "Smugglers Cut Into Our Profits"
 sichuan_events.218.d: "With new taxes being created and tax collection being streamlined, the smuggling of opium has become an even more lucrative business than ever before. The high taxes and - allegedly - 'draconian' measures by the state has allowed the gangs to undercut what the government is offering through its legal venues. Despite the best efforts of the police and army, they're still able to operate with relative ease."
 sichuan_events.218.a: "Hunt down those thugs!"

 sichuan_events.219.t: "Illegal Opium Production"
 sichuan_events.219.d: "Before the establishment of the Sales Bureau, the growth of opium was completely unregulated and undocumented. This has caused tremendous difficulties in establishing just how much opium is being grown illegally as no reliable records exist. Already our tax collectors and police are complaining that their work is like searching through the dark and that they're having a lot of difficulties bringing it all under the auspices of the state. Measures ought to be taken to expand the state's abilities to track and tax these matters!"

 sichuan_events.220.t: "The Bureau Takes Action"
 sichuan_events.220.d: "The creation of the Sales Monopoly Bureau to control has already had some successes. Through their early work, they've managed to establish framework for how to operate and how both legal and illegal production is to be dealt with. Slowly but surely, we can expect their hard work to fill our coffers as the efficiency of their efforts rise by the hour."
 sichuan_events.220.a: "This should be profitable!"

 sichuan_events.221.t: "Taxation Hampered By Corruption"
 sichuan_events.221.d: "The temptation of money gets to even the best of us. We're facing a growing problem of officials taking bribes in order to let smugglers cut into our profits. Others are simply collecting taxes and pocketing the money for themselves, only to then report it as a shortfall caused by merchants evading taxes. It seems evident by now that we simply haven't implemented sufficiently harsh punishments for this kind of selfish criminality."
 sichuan_events.221.a: "Get rid of those idiots!"

 sichuan_events.222.t: "First Opium Profits Arrive"
 sichuan_events.222.d: "Step by step, the Sales Monopoly Bureau has grown in power to become an all-encompassing, nationwide institution. Through their hard work, they've managed to cut tax evasion to a record low and brought an end to most major smuggling operations in the province. We're already starting to see tremendous profits pour into the state's coffers. With the amount of riches we're seeing from our monopoly's success, we should have no problems funding future government projects."
 sichuan_events.222.a: "Excellent!"

 sichuan_events.223.t: "Army Crushes Smugglers!"
 sichuan_events.223.d: "Utilising a mix of good intelligence and brute force, the army has swept in against a series of opium fields and smuggling hubs across Sichuan, burning and bombing several to ashes and inflicting grievous losses on the criminals. By the end of the day, a large quantity of illegal fields and warehouses were destroyed and a significant portion of the known smuggling ships used along the Yangtze were destroyed as well. All around, this operation has dealt a devastating blow to these criminals. Not only has this operation utterly routed several of the smuggler outfits, but it's also sure to send a clear message to criminals that their profiteering from narcotics will lead to their demise.\n\nThis decisive victory by the army has helped us to significantly improve the situation in our fight to curb opium and taught our army valuable lessors in fighting unconventional enemies in varied environments."

 sichuan_events.224.t: "The Army Fights Smugglers"
 sichuan_events.224.d: "Recent days have seen a large offensive by the military against the smugglers plaguing Sichuan. A series of raids on illegal farms, smuggling warehouses and other facilities used by criminal gangs around Sichuan. Although not decisive, the army has won a victory while taking relatively light casualties from enemies armed with light arms smuggled into the country. This operation has also taught our troops and commanders a few valuable lessons in fighting foes in forests and towns."
 sichuan_events.224.a: "Our soldiers fought well today."

 sichuan_events.225.t: "Army Struggles Against Smugglers"
 sichuan_events.225.d: "Our recent military operations against the smugglers were met with mixed results. Utilising weapons left behind during the civil war, they fought back and locked our forces in a series of guerrilla battles that bogged them down. While we were able to disrupt their operations and kill several criminals, their tenacity allowed them to evacuate and relocate large amount of opium and weapons before we could destroy them. Although losses were only moderate and some progress was made, even the biggest optimists are having a hard time spinning this as a victory."
 sichuan_events.225.a: "We'll get them next time."

 sichuan_events.226.t: "Army Routed By Smugglers!"
 sichuan_events.226.d: "Terrible news from the latest round of anti-smuggling operations. As embarrassing as it may sound, our inept commanders have allowed their soldiers to be routed by common bandits. Using military-grade weapons salvaged from the civil war and likely knowing where we would strike, they were able to ambush and gun down our forces. Losses are said to be very heavy and the nature of the attacks leave little doubts that we may have several moles within our ranks acting on the behalf of the smugglers. An investigation is already being carried out into the matter.\n\nThere's no way to spin this other than as a complete defeat and despite our efforts to suppress it the newspapers in [SZC.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] are already reporting on it as a humiliating defeat that has tarnished the reputation of [SZC.GetLeader]. Some members of our government are even demanding that we urgently rethink the military's role in our campaign against opium."

Our erstwhile ally, general and former governor of Sichuan Liu Cunhou, has been unusually active in sending his troops to the region. It's certainly a nice gesture and for all intents and purposes not something to worry about, but Yang Sen suspects something may be afoot..."

 sichuan_events.252.t: "Shadowy Meetings"
 sichuan_events.252.d: "Conflicting reports continue to arrive from the Eastern and Southern Sichuan. While warlord activity is nothing new in Sichuan, it seems something else may be going on. There have been several meetings between minor warlords in the region. Our spies have not obtained much information for now, but general Fan Shaozeng, Yang Sen's second in command, strongly suspects they might be planning a coalition of minor warlords.\n\nFor what reason, it remains unknown."

 sichuan_events.253.t: "The Baoding Efforts"
 sichuan_events.253.d: "It seems history is repeating. Once again, the Chengdu army is in a sorry state, following the heavy fighting in the last months. As in 1931, after the first Officer Department expedition, the Baoding Department has taken up efforts to restore order in the south. Reports continue to come of areas successfully being pacified.\n\nWhile Baoding may yet prove to be a threat, for now our alliance with them continues to bring dividends."

Songyao, a man known for his political neutrality - having blocked off his domain to all forces involved in the civil war a few months back - but also for ruthless opportunism, has suddenly and publicly declared his allegiance to the former governor of Sichuan and Armament Department leader Liu Cunhou. Songyao is not doing this out of loyalty for the Department. Something dangerous is happening and Liu Cunhou is certainly involved in it.\n\nWe may be facing betrayal in the ranks."

 sichuan_events.255.d: "With tensions rising in the province after the unexpected alliance between Liu Cunhou and Tian Songyao, we have received a missive from Deng Xihou, who claims to have valuable information about Liu's movements and intentions. Our spies have found nothing on Cunhou's plans so far and this is a tempting offer. However, their demands might yet prove to be too much."
 sichuan_events.255.a: "Arrange this meeting. Secretly."

 sichuan_events.256.t: "Meeting Deng Xihou"
 sichuan_events.256.d: "Deng Xihou arrived tonight in Chengdu under utmost secrecy. In a shoddy basement under the old Manchu palace and after a few rounds of discussion a deal has been hashed out: Deng Xihou informs that Liu Cunhou has contacted him recently, asking for a public declaration of loyalty or at least neutrality. In exchange for guarantees of autonomy and government influence for the Baoding Department, as well as a freer hand in implementing their economic projects, both Deng Xihou and Liu Wenhui will pledge their loyalty to Yang Sen and the Armament Department.\n\nThe Baoding Department has its own interests, but Yang Sen's modernisation programme mostly aligns with their goals. Furthermore, the Baoding troops are the best-trained troops in Sichuan and will certainly prove invaluable.\n\nThe ultimate decision now rests with Yang Sen."

Liu Cunhou is planning to execute a coup a week from now, with support from Tian Songyao and several minor warlords in the province, having bought their support with promises of wealth, power or influence.\n\nWith detailed knowledge of Cunhou's planned movements and with support from the Baoding Department, we can turn this to our advantage. Liu's coup will become an inescapable trap when he launches his plot."

Unexpected by anyone in the Armament leadership and believed to be still in his base of Daxian, Liu Cunhou's troops have now begun taking over the Manchu garrison that forms the Armament headquarters. On the city streets, Tian Songyao's goons have been quick to assert their control over our drowsy troops.

With advance knowledge of the coup, Yang Sen and Fan Shaozeng feigned chaos in the garrison, which Liu Cunhou took as proof of his success. When they attempted to take the rest of the building, several battalions hidden around the enormous complex sprung into action, forming barricades and trapping Cunhou's soldiers. Looking down at Liu Cunhou's corpse on the floor, Yang Sen orders his loyal general Fan Shaozeng to sweep the building and force the surrender of any remnants of Liu's troops.\n\nDown in the lower city, Tian Songyao lays dead on the streets, killed by Baoding agents infiltrated among the populace.\n\nThe coup is over and peace can now finally return to Sichuan."

 sichuan_events.264.t: "Marshal Wang Chengbin Arrives In Sichuan"
 sichuan_events.264.d: "Following the devastating Manchu Coup as of recent, many feared that the North Zhili Clique was doomed, cast away to the dustbin of history. With the brutal Zhili-Manchu War seeing the third hierarch of the Zhili Clique, Marshal Wang Chengbin, rally the forces of the Zhili in a last ditch effort to retake Beijing, the losses were tremendous. With the loss of Cao Kun and Wu Peifu in one fell swoop, the Zhili rank and file were initially heavily demoralised. Without the Jade Marshal, could they stand a chance? Could they even defeat the Manchu? Let alone any other warlord? And so here he arrived, the pale horse, here to vanquish the Zhili Clique once and for all.\n\nYet there stood a man, defiant of the Royalist's ambitions, defiant of the bloodshed, defiant of the death of his mentor Cao Kun. Minister of the Army Marshal Wang Chengbin, having not been present at Beijing during the coup attempt, stood as the first rallying point for the chaotic Zhili forces. Championing the emergency strategies of the Civil War, he would fight tooth and nail to preserve Zhili Hegemony, to avenge his fallen friend, and even regretfully that of Wu Peifu. For what would he be for their memory to die in vain? Staging a delayed retreat, Wang would have to bear the full brutality of the Royalist armies. Levelling whole cities, annihilating Luoyang, rampaging in Wuhan, and it was all for naught.\n\nWith many presuming that Wang Chengbin died in the fighting, perhaps in Luoyang or Wuhan, none within [SZC.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] would have expected the humble arrivals last night. A convoy of trucks, unmarked, and clearly worn down, arrived on the outskirts of [SZC.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. A military patrolman ordered them to turn back. Although when they stopped, the patrolman was in utter disbelief. Stepping out of the first truck, arm wrapped in a blood-soaked bandage and face covered in shrapnel wounds, was Marshal Wang.\n\nThe guardsman quickly flagged the convoy to [SZC.GetLeader]'s compound in the centre of the city, where he received Wang and the remnants of Beijing's command structure. Fury and revenge in his eyes, Wang pleaded to [SZC.GetLeader], imploring  him to assemble his forces and prepare for a campaign of reconquest against the despised Royalists."

 sichuan_events.265.t: "Marshal Wang Chengbin Resurfaces!"
 sichuan_events.265.d: "In our resounding triumph against the Zhili dogs, we were positive that the King of Baoding and the Jade Marshal had persihed, for their bodies littered the throne room. Ever a loyalist to Cao however, the previous Minister of the Army, Wang Chengbin, launched an immediate counterattack against the coup. With brutal fighting taking place in the streets of the capital, the demoralised, disorganised Zhili forces ultimately crumbled to our elite Imperial Guards let by Xiqia. Rebounding however, Marshal Wang would carry on his fruitless, pointless struggle against the Son of Heaven.\n\nWaging a fighting retreat from north of the Yellow River, Wang would fight a bitter, even admirable, supposed last stand within the Jade Marshal's old Headquarters of Luoyang. With his soldiers rather dying than giving up the city, they ultimately forced our hand in the civil war, resulting in the nigh flattening of Luoyang. Presuming to have perished in the fighting, many of our sources supposedly confirmed such statements. However with the civil war continuing elsewhere under the likes of Liu Zhenhua, Xiao Yaonan and Zhang Qihuang, we could hardly spare the manpower to count the bodies.\n\nWith rumours having surfaced in the Capital that the King of Baoding's most staunch ally and friend escaped to Sichuan, it would appear that the Marshal managed to sway [SZC.GetLeader] to his side. Attempting to mount one last, final campaign of reconquest to oust our Mandate, the Zhili Clique have proven themselves an exceedingly resilient opponent. Despite controlling a famine and civil war province largely considered a backwater, the Zhili still retain a large amount of their forces, and have the sheer willpower to see their campaign through."
 sichuan_events.265.a: "That blasted Marshal of Tianjin!"
 sichuan_events.265.b: "Their cause has merit!"

 sichuan_events.266.t: "Growing Rifts"
 sichuan_events.266.d: "Long a component of the internal politics of the Zhili Clique, the Clique itself is distinctly split amongst numerous lines. The North Zhili, under the auspices of the late Cao Kun, Wu Peifu and Wang Chengbin. The South Zhili, under the whims of Sun Chuanfang and Qi Xieyuan. Even within those branches, there lies intra-personal faction dynamics. The North has its Luoyang and Jinbao factions, belonging to Wu and Cao. The South has the dispensable loyalties of all of Sun Chuanfang's underlings. And even then, there remains the crucial split between the men of guns and the men of words.\n\nWhen the Zhili Clique restored their control of Beijing in the late 1920s, the Zhili Clique would formally attempt to organise themselfs into a legitimate government. With the majority of the men of words taking positions within the Assembly and Cabinet, the men of guns would resign themselves to controlling Provinces, and their own sections of the provincial and central armies. Following the death of Cao and Wu however, the intricate balance and relationships between the military and political wings of the Clique has been torn apart.\n\nWith Wu and Cao reigning in their respective wings, their absence has led to the drawing of daggers between the likes of Marshal Wang and his suited contemporaries. Exile further straining relations, the civilians have gathered themselves around the magnanimous Yan Huiqing. A senior diplomat, bureaucrat, former Prime Minister and President, he has begun to frequently argue with Wang Chengbin and the rest of the Zhili Military Apparatus over the best course of action for the future of their governance. Due to their conflict, many within the former Sichuan provincial government fear that a deep rift is beginning to open."
 sichuan_events.266.a: "We cannot be divided now!"

 sichuan_events.267.t: "Ascension of the Diplomat"
 sichuan_events.267.d: "A curiosity amongst the inner circles of the Zhili Clique, many within the internal patronage network actually consider Yan Huiqing to be that of an outsider. Having never formally been welcomed into the fold of the Zhili, Yan himself represents the prestigious, and mostly apolitical, diplomatic corps of the Beiyang Republic. Serving multiple times in a caretaker role as Prime Minister or President on behalf of the Zhili Clique, Yan has proven himself incredibly dilligent in regards to ensuring that Beiyang governments remain afloat.\n\nOnce again it would appear that Yan is necessary to maintain stability and prevent anarchy for the Zhili. Having managed to negotiate enough support, leveraging his extensive ties to the bureaucracy and spotless track record, Yan has utilised his position within the government to request from Marshal Wang that they pursue a civilian path, which Wang has accepted. Being elected to the position of President, in exile of course, alongside being joined by the likes of Gu Weijun, Bai Jianwu, Wang Kemin, Marshal Wang and Gao Lingwei amongst others, Yan Huiqing's government resembles that of one carefully balanced between Beiyang bureaucrats and Zhili diehards.\n\nWith the noble goal of asserting civilian control over the military, and preventing the foolish missteps that lead to the Manchu Coup in the first place, many are hopeful of their goals. Albeit many are equally sceptical that they will accomplish anything of note."

 sichuan_events.268.t: "The Rise of the Scion of Tianjin"
 sichuan_events.268.d: "The Third Hierarch. The Scion of Tianjin. Minister of the Army. Marshal of the Republic. Traitor to the Zhili. Wang Chengbin retains numerous monikers of mixed sentiments. Lacking the national respect and loyalty of the Jade Marshal, Wang has always played second fiddle to Wu Peifu. Yet Wang was perhaps the only man Wu Peifu feared, for he genuinely threatened his position within the Zhili Clique, having been a companion of Cao Kun longer than Wu had been. Putting everything on the line to aid his mentor, Wang would ultimately be relegated to soft retirement due to Wu's machinations, resulting in Wang's treachery in the Beijing Coup of 1924.\n\nReturning to the fold during the third ZhiFeng War, Wang would prove himself to be President Cao Kun's most loyal advocate within military circles, acting as his mouthpiece and an ever present reminder of the King of Baoding's looming network over the military apparatus. And on that day, Wang was one of the few suspicious of the buildup towards the eventful coup attempt, colluding with the Jade Marshal over reports of strenuous troop manoeuvres. And yet he could feasibly do nothing to save his mentor, or the reviled Wu Peifu. Consumed by himself, he would nonetheless order a relentless counter-attack attempting to squash the rebellion before it gained any steam.\n\nUltimately futile, now here he is, a vengeful spirit, a dead man walking. Having shot up to the forefront of the Zhili Hierarchy, Wang commands the admiration of the full essence of the Jinbao Clique, and even some members of the Luoyang Clique curry favour with the Marshal of Tianjin. Utilising his now legendary status, Wang managed to force the civilians under Yan Huiqing to kowtow to the military's primacy in such an emergency situation. Promising a swift retribution towards the fledgling, paltry Manchu forces to the Remnant High Command, many within the Clique and the nation are preparing for the last ride of the Zhili Clique."

 sichuan_events.269.d: "Utterly demolished beyond repair, having lost both its Head and Second-in-Command, the Zhili Clique Guanxi system has been thrown into complete disarray following the Coup attempt. Able to muster some semblance of authority, at least enough to mount an admirable resistance in lieu of the Jade Marshal, Wang Chengbin's new position as the absolute authority of the North Zhili Clique has only recently been cemented, with the acquiescence of all other potential claimants, such as that of Zhang Qihuang or Cai Chengxun.\n\nHowever what remains of the Zhili military hierarchy is a shambled corpse, riddled with bullet holes. Losing numerous officer in the fighting still, there has been a dire neccessitation for reform, modernisation and the elevation of youthful survivors to the forefront of military command. Blaming Wu Peifu's reluctance and inability to enact meaningful reforms in the high command due to believing in his perfect system of complete officer autonomy, Marshal Wang Chengbin has written letters to a series of commanders, requesting the names of exceptional individuals whom have proven themselves beyond the normal line of duty.\n\nUndertaking a massive reform effort in light of the exile, the Marshal has collaborated with the likes of Jiang Baili to implement and utilise his extensive military strategy knowledge in the hopes that the new doctrine will be enough to vanquish the nascent and inexperienced Royalist armies. Reflecting, one can only place faith in the loyalty and tenacity of the common soldier to see the Zhili's vengeance to fruition."

With Beijing in its stranglehold, the most powerful man in China at its side, and the numerous connections utilised by Cao Kun, many believed that their rule would weather any storm. Although following the League Collapse, and the inaction of the Cabinet to intervene on the side of either the League or the Anti-Concessionists, the Royal Court utilised the negative popular sentiment, and the estrangement of the Zhili's German benefactors, in order to spur an opportunity to eradicate the hydra at its head.\n\nAnd so the Manchu Princes and the Zongshe party would doubt the tenacity, stubborness and willpower of the Zhili Clique. Rallying around the now infamous Marshal of Tianjin, Wang Chengbin, the Zhili would greatly wound the Manchu Government as they fought a delayed retreat into neighbouring provinces. Willing to sacrifice self and soul in order to prevent the return of an absolutist monarchy, the numerous last stands in the Zhili-Manchu Civil War was reminiscent of the Xinhai Revolution. Dying as martyrs for their cause, the Manchu would treat them with extreme prejudice. Eradicating villages and whole cities to ensure the annihilation of the Zhili Clique.\n\nHowever here they are, the [SZC.GetName], representatives of the steel defiance of the Zhili Clique. Under the auspices of [SZC.GetLeader], they have reached out to [ROOT.GetLeader] with a peculiar offer. Proposing an equal pact of loyalty and co-belligerence, they desire a collaborative effort to oust the Manchu menace from Beijing, and restore the true authority of the Xinhai Revolution's former republican glory."

With Feng Yuxiang and Wang Chengbin's defection spurring on the 1924 Beijing Coup, it would see the capture of Cao Kun, the expulsion of Wu Peifu and the majority of his command staff, with the last remnants of Zhili control remaining within the hands of Hubei Governor Xiao Yaonan.\n\nEven at that point, the Clique rejuvenated themselves, with Wu seeking refuge with Zhao Hengti, retaking Henan Province, and recapturing Zhili province with the additional aid of Fengtian. And again, when the all consuming torrent of revolutionary fervour, the National Revolutionary Army, marched northwards to expel all warlords, of any allegiance, the North and South Zhili alongside Fengtian banded together to form the Anguojun. Cao Kun, utilising his connections and wit, negotiated German intervention, and the rest was history.\n\nPresumptuously here we are again, with the core Zhili Clique and the Cabinet fleeing to Sichuan, none were aware of the true extent of the Clique's losses. Presumably, many had their flames extinguished in the fighting. Early this morning, however, a general and some of his retainers have straggled into Chengdu, carrying with them armaments, and a small reserve of gold."

 sichuan_events.274.t: "Luoyang Retaken"
 sichuan_events.274.d: "The wreckage, the carnage, the bloodshed. Marshal Wang and his other compatriots are all too familiar with the scene of Luoyang not too long ago. Long an ancient, core cradle of Chinese civilisation, Luoyang as it stands is but a shell of its former self. With history dating back to the Classical Era, Luoyang was even the capital of numerous dynasties, such as that of the Eastern Han, becoming the focal point of China for decades. With such a stature however, Luoyang has seen numerous hardships, numerous destructions, pillaging, the whole ensemble of devastation.\n\nEver since the Yuan dynasty, Luoyang's status as the \"Middle Capital\" and the natural legal capital was much reduced, having been razed completely numerous times. Nonetheless, modern Luoyang was once again a nexus of importance. Considered the headquarters of the Jade Marshal, it garnered significant attention during the Second ZhiFeng war, and all ensuing conflicts between the Zhili and its enemies.\n\nDespite its historical status however, that did not prevent the zealous Royalist soldiers from nigh razing Luoyang once again. With Marshal Wang holding his presumed last stand in the city, the Royalists responded with extreme prejudice and force. Now that we've retaken the province however, it is clear the raw devastation that the Manchu have wrought in their fury. The first step in the reclamation of China, and it is bittersweet.\n\nNonetheless, the Zhili have a duty to preserve, and order to reinstitute, and the capture of Luoyang is a fantastic propaganda victory for our nation's morale."

 sichuan_events.275.d: "Another one of the Zhili's tremendous strongholds, Wuhan (the collective name for Wuchang, Hankou and Hanyang) was not spared the ferocity of Royalist forces in their bloodlust to drive the Zhili out of the Central Plains. With history dating back to the Shang Dynasty, in its hallowed ground lies 3500 years of Chinese culture and civlisation. One of the key hotspots of ancient Confucianism, it spurred on the \"Wenjin Academy\", which is known as the \"the oldest existing university in China\", lying similarly amongst the ranks of Yuelu Academy in Hunan, or Donglin Academy in Jiangsu.\n\nTruly flourishing and setting the stage for the modern city in the Three Kingdoms period, the city transformed into a cultural and economic hub along the Yangtze. The seat of many opposition regimes, it truly became a renowned market for merchants, as its unique position straddling the Yangtze and the Han River resulted in it being the natural meeting point between traders all across Central China. Even garnering the nickname \"Chicago of the East\" in reference to the industrial, financial, transportation and cultural importance of Chicago to America.\n\nFairly prosperous and spared from much retribution compared to other Chinese hubs of development, Wuhan would nonetheless become the site of the greatest battle of the last century. With Hankou and Hanyang falling to advancing National Revolutionary Armies in the Northern Expedition, Wuchang itself would continue to resist. Following German intervention, and the internal politicking of the Kuomintang, the National Revolution would tear itself apart, allowing for the forces of Wu Peifu, Xiao Yaonan and the Southern Zhili to extinguish the Kuomintang remnant forces.\n\nWith out forces now capturing such an ancient, and beloved industrial city, our soldiers have begun to praise the seizure as a repeat of the \"Miracle of 1927\", with Marshal Wang being heralded as a military genius. Already there is a growing sense that our path is a righteous one, and that we will soon retake the Northern Capital, and restore the rightful rule of the Zhili once and for all."

 sichuan_events.276.t: "The Fall of Beijing"
 sichuan_events.276.d: "Perhaps the most pivotal, valued, and internationally known city in all of China, Beijing's history dates back 3000 years, and its role both in our catapult to power, and in our downfall, is with no equal. The earliest events of Beijing's history however, are shrouded in myth and legend, with the first event in its history retaining historical backing being the deposure of the last Shang King by King Wu of Zhou. Long a seat of power within the north, Beijing's history is marred by raids from frontier nomads, and the continued construction of even more elaborate defences to defend against them.\n\nIronically, Beijing would first be placed onto the map of significance under the guise of \"Nanjing\" for the Liao Dynasty's seat of power was in present-day Inner Mongolia. Under Liao rule the city developed gigantically, becoming a cultural hotspot of Khitan, Xi, Shiwei, Balhae and Han. Later becoming \"Zhongdu\", or the \"Central Capital\" under the Jin, the city would once again see a doubling in its size, and rapid development. Yet it would see the most advance under the Yuan dynasty.\n\nWith Kubali Khan dubbing it \"Dadu\", or \"Grand Capital\", it would become the seat of power for the whole of China. Finally, it would gain the moniker of \"Beijing\" in 1403, under the Ming dynasty. Flourishing under the Ming and Qing, Beijing's integral importance to Modern Chinese culture would cemented, becoming the most sought after city in the Warlord Era. The seat of the Beiyang Republic and all of its faculties, whomever ruled Beijing ruled China.\n\nAnd so it is clear, with the recapturing of the Northern Capital, that once again the Zhili have resuscitated the Republican dream. Vanquishing the Royalist defenders, our elite forces managed to methodically sweep through the city's streets, resulting in a desperate last stand within the Forbidden City, reminiscent of the last stands held in the Liao, the Ming and the Qing. Nonetheless, [SZC.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has erupted in a bouquet of celebrations as the last remnants of a bygone era are deposed once more!"

Inundated with the elite, devoted and zealous forces of the Imperial Guard, several layers of defence lay before our brave soldiers. With the majority of our forces, diverted to other fronts or otherwise clearing out the streets of Beijing from its decadence, only a small grouping of several detachments were dispensed with sieging and taking the Imperial Court. Under the local authority of Guo Jijiao, an exceptional young commander with a flood of potential, he devised an excellent strategy of thorough sweeps between the halls and annals of the Palace and its external structures.\n\nExperiencing heavy casualties, but with morale overflowing, the brave men under Guo implemented a methodical search for the Boy Emperor and his clan. Encountering the likes of Jixing and Zaitao as exterior defenders, the two Manchu Princes would ultimately fall to advancing Zhili units. Leading a small squad, Guo would successfully excavate the throne room, finding Puyi hidden behind the Dragon Throne, cowering in fear. As they tried to drag him from the room his brother alongside his cousin, Princes Pujie and Xiqia, burst into the room with a few remaining guardsmen, attempting to suicidally prevent Guo from seizing the Emperor.\n\nHowever futile their last stand was, many brave men died in the exchange, with Guo even being wounded. Not withstanding, the Emperor has been captured, and his puppetmasters are dead! Whilst many of the more radical members of the military staff and cabinet are demanding blood for blood, Marshal Wang and Yan have soothed tempers. Recognising that Puyi was genuinely unaware of the original coup attempt, they have instead elected to throw Puyi into prison. For whilst he cannot be blamed for the death of Cao or Wu, his crimes against the Republic are numerous. Potentially in the future, he can be released, as a model citizen. Until then, he rots."

A nation of so much beauty, love and compassion, constantly at our kinsmen's throats over perfidious ideological convictions, power games, and the hunger of warlords. Under the miasma of it all, the ever encompassing consumption of conviction and rage, it is often understated that we're all human. Fellow Chinese. Are we not proud of our millenia old civilisation, having withstanded the test of time?\n\nInstead we squabble amongst ourselves, with revolt, civil war, whilst the foreign imperialists grow stronger ever more. The martyrs, our nation's heroes! Oh how bountiful their knowledge and majesty! Only they truly understood what was at stake. And only now do we fully understand their message. Attempting to construct a nation out of a shambling cadre of warlord militarists is not an easy task. President Cao and Marshal Wu knew this too well. And yet they numerate many of the dead in this struggle. The King of Baoding, decried as the Bribing President, a true patriot intending nothing more than to strengthen his nation. The Jade Marshal, despite his continued animosity with Marshal Wang, also carried with him a grandeur of nation-building.\n\nTo erect a monument out of the rubble of the Chinese Republic, to reconstruct it singlehandedly. That was their task, and they were wiped away too soon to see it to fruition. And so it falls to us, their descendents, to carry on the mission of our forebearers and allow the Five Races Under One Union to finally fly with pride. Commemorating this occasion of remembrance and reflection, [SZC.GetLeader] has instituted a day of mourning across the nation for those who sacrificed to see the Republic carry on.

Today marks a new day in our nation's history! No more do we bow to militarists, to warlords! No more do we allow democracy to be placed in the guillotine! The monarchy is gone, and so too shall autocracy follow!\" Those were the words echoing from Huang Fu on the outskirts of the National Assembly in Beijing as of recent, following the announcement of a new Presidential Election. To be held swiftly, it is a hallmark moment in the Chinese nation's history. For it is the true test of the people's capacity to exert their will on the future of our nation. The Zhili of course, are all too familiar with the primacy of democracy as the most premier method by which the people grant their voice to the nation. Expected to also posit their own candidates within the election, many believe that the Zhili's candidates have a sure-fire spot to the Presidency.\n\nNonetheless that does not stop a myriad of parties and factions from proposing their own candidates. Within the Independents there lies the magnanimous Hu Shih, from Political Science there is the aforementioned Huang Fu, Xu Qin from the Constitutionalists alongside Shen Junru and Liu Chongyou from the National Salvation Federation.

As even they acknowledge that without the Zhili's sacrifices, they would not even be standing in their current positions, and the Republic as we know it may very well have been squandered.\n\nIn light of this, the many delegates within the Assembly and Senate were the real figures to sway. With the majority of the Harmony Association either fleeing, being imprisoned or murdered in light of the Beijing Coup, their previous stranglehold in the organs of government is far from certain. And therefore a real chance for the opposition to seize the day presented itself. At least, that's what the newspapers and idealists believe.\n\nIn reality, the Chinese people and officials know all too well that whilst the opposition parties contributed their fair share to the reconstitution of the Beiyang Republic, it was the Zhili and Zhili alone that rallied for the Five Races Under One Union in defiance of Japanese lapdogs and autocratic Monarchists. To this end, the Election of [GetYear] whilst feasibly split between numerous candidates, really was isolated towards two.

With only a narrow window to take him out, an assassin opened for on him with a scoped Gewehr 98k rifle from a nearby building as Wenhui exited his car on the short way to the building itself. It was a brazen act that nearly succeeded. As luck would have it though, the shot miraculously missed Wenhui by a mere fraction of an inch, leaving a mark as it passed near the very fabric of his uniform but spared the warlord from any injuries. His personal bodyguards then quickly covered him and rushed him into the building, leaving the sniper with no hopes to succeed with a second shot.\n\nThe tight security in the city meant that the culprit was apprehended by soldiers before he could escape. On pain of death, he confessed to everything, as if an admission of Xiang's involvement was really needed at this point.

The length of this border, however, meant that Xiang had a hard time creating a defensive strongpoint, meaning that this force was mostly meant to hold off the invasion long enough to fall back once the rest of the Accelerated Department had mobilised and prepared for a counter-attack. The battle would be a draw, with Xiang's soldiers being forced to withdraw sooner than expected, but hampering the advance of Wenhui enough to prevent them from overrunning the basin. The war is far from over however and for now it seems like either side can win this."

 sichuan_events.407.d: "As expected, the march on Ya'an was proving to be a difficult venture. As soon as his forces entered Xikang, they were met with prepared defences in the mountains with few roads to speak of, meaning that even small squads with machine guns and mortars could hold off Xiang's forces for hours and inflict debilitating losses upon them as narrow roads were turned into kill zones. Be that as it may, the Accelerated Department marches on, evidently determined to take the mountains by force no matter the costs."

A back and forth followed, as neither side was initially able to gain a clear advantage over the other. While the Accelerated Department is stronger on paper, their task of taking Ya'an is a daunting one to say the least. Once more, Sichuan has fallen into a bloody civil war."

 sichuan_events.409.t: "The Two Lius' War"
 sichuan_events.409.d: "After the victory of Liu Xiang's faction of the Accelerated Department in the recent Sichuanese civil war, the ambitious and aggressive Liu Xiang rose to power. Many observers both at home and abroad saw this as a worrisome development as few believe even for a second that his lust for power will stop at his own border. Recently, however, an opportunity to remove him has shown itself.\n\nThere is a known rivalry between Liu Xiang and his uncle Liu Wenhui, the latter still controlling large portions of the remnants of the Baoding Department which fought in the last civil war. This rivalry has now turned into yet another civil war between the two. While it's certain to harm Xiang's ambitions regardless of outcome, this does present the opportunity to bring the far less aggressive Baoding Department to power. Perhaps we should tip the scales of the conflict by providing covert aid to Liu Wenhui's efforts to oust his nephew?"

 sichuan_events.410.d: "The rush to war seems to have had unintended consequences for the Accelerated Department. Tian the turncoat has switched sides numerous times in the past and served every master known to Sichuan. While a backstabbing opportunist, his considerable personal force has still allowed him to scrape by. It seems that now, however, he's officially declared himself loyal to the Baoding Department once more and sided with them, as he did over a decade ago. Why he had this convenient change of heart in the middle of a war is anyone's guess, but anyone that knows this snake ought to know that it likely won't be his last."
 sichuan_events.410.a: "Traitor!"

 sichuan_events.411.t: "The Battle of Meishan"
 sichuan_events.411.d: "Regardless of who shot first, the Baoding remnants weren't going to survive for long if they advanced into the basin. As such, they had been predominantly relied on the harsh terrain of Xikang to wear down the Accelerated Department. They could hold off the superior enemy forces with relative ease and few numbers by simply funnelling them through prepared defences. While this slowed them down, this was a war of attrition where one side was able to replace their losses while Xikang was devoid of an industrial base.\n\nEventually, the slow push by the Accelerated Department put the bulk of their forces outside of the city of Meishan, the last major strategic obstacle on the road to Ya'an. While Baoding had bought themselves plenty of time to prepare their defences, they were clearly in an unenviable position as they fought an enemy that, on paper, was superior. It had, however, been withered down by attrition and a portion of the heavy equipment was still being transported through the mountain passes.\n\nLiu Xiang must now choose: mount a full-on assault without the support of the department's heavy equipment, or wait for it to arrive and utilise it to full effect. Attacking now should provide a good chance for surprise, but it's a risky gamble against the city's prepared defences. On the other hand, it would at the very least take several days to bring the artillery pieces to the front, giving Baoding valuable time to prepare."

 SZC_meishan_assault: "The mountains were their only ally. With them behind us, they have nothing. They're poorly supplied, disorganised and under-equipped. Even without our heavy guns, we should have enough firepower to make short work of them. Once we storm the city, their defences are sure to crumble before the might of the Accelerated Department."
 SZC_meishan_reinforce: "Although they're in a difficult position, without our artillery to take out their cannons and machine guns we'll endure staggering losses. Although getting them here will prove very difficult given the terrain, more cautious officers believe it's well worth the effort."

 sichuan_events.412.t: "The Assault on Meishan"
 sichuan_events.412.d: "Choosing to attack right away, the Accelerated Department was pitted against the city's defenders without their heavy equipment. Even without them however, the divisions had many more mortars, machine guns and light cannons to prove a match for the city's defenders. Baoding had already lost most of their heavy equipment in the first phase of the civil war that saw Xiang take Chengdu. With little chance to replace these losses, the city's defences were rather simple, all told. Trenches, old machine guns and rifles made up the bulk of them, with an occasional cannon forming a handful of strong points in a wedge outline.\n\nAlthough Xiang's forces faced heavy losses in taking the city, the main defensive line was broken within hours of fighting. Wenhui wasn't a brilliant strategist by any stretch of the imagination and his primitive defensive lines offered few surprises for the attackers. After the centrepiece of the defensive line was broken, the Accelerated Department swarmed into the city and shattered the remaining defences from the sides. Although Liu Wenhui managed to escape, prisoners of war already tell that morale is low and that even he has no hopes of winning."

 sichuan_events.413.t: "The Xikang Rout"
 sichuan_events.413.d: "While opting to wait, not only did Xiang give the defenders more time to prepare, but his forces were constantly subjected to harassment by Baoding forces in the mountains. Getting supplies to the front was a logistical nightmare and many of the artillery pieces being moved were damaged or lost to the perilous mountain roads as Xiang had ordered haste to go before safety.\n\nOnce the attack was ready, the few artillery pieces that made it to the front did not make much of a difference. Xiang's forces had been withered down by the thousands through attrition, both at the hands of the mountains and rear-guard actions by Baoding. It was a demoralised force that eventually attacked the well-prepared defences and the losses suffered to nature quickly showed. While the defences around the city were an unimaginative imitation of Weltkrieg-era fortifications, the few cannons and machine guns that Wenhui possessed were able to hold the line against the enemy, albeit narrowly. After several successive assaults, the city had been damaged, the defences were badly battered, but Xiang's vanguard had been destroyed. Thousands laid dead on the ground, many more were injured or taken prisoner.\n\nWith no hopes of taking the city, Xiang is now forced to retreat from Xiking. While no force in Sichuan was able to match the Accelerated Department in the field, the Accelerated Department had finally been bested by the mountains themself more than anything else. As they retreated, it was a disaster akin to Napoleon's flight from Moscow as the terrain and pursuers kept withering down the once might Accelerated Department. There's already talk about a mutiny within the Accelerated Department and Xiang's future seems very uncertain."

He envisioned a future where mighty ships that would rival the German Hochseeflotte in its finest days would patrol the Yangtze River and protect Sichuanese trade. The 'first steps towards greatness' have earned Sichuan complete naval dominance in the region, granted, but simply because no one bothered with contesting it. Nevertheless, a victory is a victory. Soon it was announced that a public display of this newly attained naval might was to be had. To impress the locals and terrify future foes, of course.\n\nThe public was invited to this first naval exercise showing off the strength of the Navy. The biggest warships on this part of the Yangtze were a handful of old steam-powered ships that had been hastily converted from their old civilian roles and pressed into military service. The makeshift warships had iron plates fitted onto them, as well as batteries of guns that had been taken from local artillery regiments and forcibly converted to fit this new role. Once the naval exercise kicked off in full force, it didn't take long before the obvious problems started to show up.\n\nSichuan's first admiral must've drawn a sigh of relief when the ships could actually move despite the increase in armour and armaments. Unbearably slowly, granted, but at least they didn't sink to the bottom of the river. It would all culminate into a triple gun salute, but when the old howitzers fired, the recoil of the shots nearly made the old steam ship capsize. Panic gripped the crew and several of them jumped off into the Yangtze, fearing that their ship would fully turn over. While their worst fears were not realised, this whole farce has led to a fair bit of ridicule as the narrowly avoided naval disaster led to more than a few satirical poems being written at Xiang's expense. While the people are laughing (at least when they're sure the secret police isn't around), the same can't be said for Xiang.\n\nOr Sichuan's first admiral, for that matter."

He envisioned a future where mighty ships that would rival the German Hochseeflotte in its finest days would patrol the South China Sea to protect Sichuan's growing status as a regional power. The 'first steps towards greatness' have not impressed the other naval powers in the region, granted, but Xiang has nonetheless earned the attention of the naval powers in the region, if only by virtue of actually managing to building a navy in the first place.

 sichuan_events.415.d: "Today the first shipment of imported aircraft arrived in Chongqing for official inspection from none other than the triumphant Liu Xiang himself. The whole affair had a very ceremonial flair to it more than anything else, however. This was a way to show off the beginnings of Sichuan's so-called Mighty Air Force to the world, or at the very least the assembled Chinese press. While the triumphant bombast was over-the-top for the occasion, Xiang was right to mark this as an important occasion marking the modernisation of Sichuan and the province's rapid adoption of contemporary military technology and methods.\n\nThe planes were hardly anything spectacular by global military standards, granted. While they were fine machines in the Weltkrieg, the assembled collection of formerly mothballed holdovers would hardly cause the lords in Beijing to quake in their boots - nor the emperor in Tokyo, for that matter. By the standards of China's oft-neglected interior, however, these were a great leap into the twentieth century. Given the state of the regional powers, these handful of relics could fly over the mountains and gather information on enemy positions that would be very difficult to gather on foot. The often narrow terrains of mountain passes and openness of the basins meant that even a Weltkrieg-era holdover with a pair of synchronised machine guns could effectively harass infantry formations that had never faced a strafing run before.\n\nFor all his bluster about an air force that could dominate the skies over China, he might be very right, at least as far as his own backyard is concerned. All that said, pictures were taken of Xiang shaking the hands of pilots and engineers and the stories would be printed the following day."

 sichuan_events.416.t: "The Chongqing Air Parade"
 sichuan_events.416.d: "It wasn't long after the creation of Sichuan's 'mighty air force' that Liu Xiang declared that all of China and even the world was to tremble before its might. Eager to show to allies and enemies alike that Sichuan was to dominate the skies above China from here on out, the Chongqing Air Parade was hastily organised to demonstrate Sichuanese aerial dominance.\n\nWhile the air force itself was merely a collection of old interwar planes collecting dust in European and Japanese warehouses, it certainly impressed the crowds that had gathered to see the spectacle. After all, most of Sichuan's peasants and city-dwellers alike had scarcely even seen such flying machines in photographs. With this being the first time some of these pilots had set foot inside a cockpit, the air parade was a far cry from its counterparts in Canada and Germany and the rookie pilots would simply start and perform the most basic manoeuvres before landing, usually without any complications.\n\nSimple as it may have been, this was enough to draw applause from the crowds, many of whom were genuinely proud that their nation could boast such modern European airplanes. Towards the end of the show Xiang offered Pan Wenhua, the mayor of Chongqing, a chance to try flying along in one of the two-seat fighters. Pan, perhaps a bit weary from knowing just how inexperienced these pilots were, politely declined the offer, citing his busy schedule running the capital. His adjutant would get the honour in his place and thus the old fighter set off for the final display of the day, ordered by Xiang himself to push the plane to its limits. All remaining audience members saw the plane lift, but amazement soon turned into horror as black smoke started to pour out from the old plane's engine. The inexperienced pilot struggled to regain control of his plane as its altitude fluctuated back and forth until finally and tragically his attempts caused the plane's engine to stall, sending it down to the ground like a comet.\n\nBoth the pilot and the passenger died on the spot, to the shock and horror of the civilian and military members of the audience. It wasn't long afterwards that Pan, realising of just how narrowly he cheated death, started to quietly suspect that this had been an assassination attempt on him by the paranoid Liu Xiang. This caused discord in the alliance between him and Liu Xiang, not to mention region-wide ridicule at the farcical, yet tragic, air parade over the outskirts of Chongqing."

With the Officer Department fully in charge, efforts were made to thoroughly reorganise the administration. The civil service in particular was thoroughly investigated, corrupt elements purged, capable hands hired to fill gaps and positions removed or shifted around for better efficiency. On the one hand, this disrupted the bureaucracy for quite some time, but visible improvements are already noted.

Individual, provincial, national and foreign governments, as well as banks and so on, have been printing and minting currency independently with varying legality. Sichuan has had it particularly bad because of the various cliques fighting for control of the province. Monetary reform has entered a new stage with the Officers' takeover. With proper finances restored, inflation is being brought under control, useless currencies destroyed and illegal mints shut down.

Despite disruptions being noted in the administration and sometimes confrontations between government forces and powerful criminal organisations or hired goons leading to violence and damage, the Officers openly boast about different corrupt figures being arrested and punished.

The bloated armies in Sichuan have been a massive burden on the government and, more importantly, the people. The measure is meant to help restructure the provincial army and free up revenue for public works and social programmes. Since armed internal opposition has become marginal since the Officer Department's victory, it has become safe enough to implement such a radical step against warlordism and the remaining troops will focus on fighting bandits instead of each other."

Lü Chao and his Industrial Corps have also heeded the truce, despite his hostility towards Xiong due to their bitter falling out following the KMT-Federalist split. Liu Wenhui, one of the leaders of the Baoding Department, has worked to ingratiate himself to both Li and Xiong.\n\nAfter the initial truce, Xiong and Li have called for a province-wide convention, led by the various military forces abiding by the provincial truce in hopes of determining a successor governor to Yang Sen. While many names were offered, Xiong Kewu and Li Jiayu have risen above the rest. While Xiong holds a commanding influence in the convention as Sichuan's foremost federalist, Li has found greater support amongst the minor factions.\n\nLü Chao, hesitant to embrace his old rival, has established a correspondence with Li, perhaps naively hoping to push him to embrace more revolutionary principles. Liu Wenhui, whilst greatly desiring the post of provincial governor, opted not to put his own name forward, out of fear of being driven out of Sichuan entirely.

In Yunnan, various intellectuals coalesced into the Crescent Moon Society under Luo Longji. However, it seems that even Southern China has become inhospitable to the cause of Chinese democracy.\n\nIndeed, it seems that Xiong Kewu's Sichuan Clique is the last major stronghold of federalism and liberty. Zhang Junmai's DSP, Luo Longji's CMS, as well as numerous other democratic parties formerly associated with the Federation of Chinese Democratic Parties have come together in a convention at Nanchong to discuss matters of state with Zhang Lan. While all attending parties have agreed to form a new China Democratic League, the question of leadership has become hotly contested.\n\nWhile the Liangists at the convention have continued to call for the attending parties to recognise Zhang Junmai as the leading force of the Democratic Movement in Sichuan, others have instead pointed to the host Zhang Lan as a stabilising force and as a compromise candidate. While Zhang Lan may sport leftist views which may be considered radical by many within the convention, none doubt his sincerity to democracy.

However it seems that even the Federalist strongholds in Southern China have fallen, leaving just Sichuan as the sole bastion of the Federalist Movement. As Federalist exiles and Third Way Democrats make their way to Sichuan, it has become clear that the mantle of freedom and provincial autonomy has fallen to Xiong, and establishment of a government for a Free China is paramount.\n\nRecognising this necessity, Xiong has called a Federalist Convention to establish the new Sichuan Federal Government. Attending is not only his Nine Man Regiment, but the Baoding Department, Young China Party, Officer Department, and China Democratic League. Although resolute in his dedication to be solely the sword of the Federalist Movement, Xiong Kewu has opted not to take on the position of Provisional President, to the surprise of many onlookers.\n\nXiong has instead called for his longtime right hand Dan Maoxin to take on leadership of the government. However, this move was criticised by the other attending parties, who accuse Xiong of consolidating the government purely around the Nine Man Regiment. In an act of compromise, Dan has nominated Zhang Lan of the CDL to the position of President.

 sichuan_events.521.d: "Having been part of the republican struggle in Sichuan since the turn of the century, Zhang Lan has become a legendary figure on the political stage both within the province and across China. Zhang and his allies have been popular for being particularly vocal and comprehensive in their policy, advocating for local autonomy and provincial self-governance in a turbulent era, where the central government's presence is so weak and the north-south divide so pronounced that Sichuan cannot merely ally with either side carelessly.\n\nIn seeking to amend all of Sichuan's woes, the \"Outline of Provisional Autonomy for Nanchong County\" was one of the main documents drafted in March of 1921, following months of discussion between Zhang and his fellow federalist proponents like Xian Ying and Xiong Kewu. These policies were to be first trialled in Nanchong county, enacting a litany of changes on the county's social strata, which were all to be implemented on the rest of Sichuan should they have succeeded. Such ideals of the Nanchong Charter included not only the promotion of grassroots democracy, mutual assistance, regulation of taxes and revitalisation of local enterprise, but also proposed more unique ideas such as classifications of occupations into social groups and a provincial government with distinct branches like institutions in the West.\n\nDespite being trampled and cast aside by the many despots and apathetic masses of Sichuan alike, these notions of self-governance and industrial autonomy have been kept alive by many in the literati and Zhang himself. Through the years, it has only continued to evolve, incorporating ideas of higher educational opportunities as well as a need to increase Sichuan's industrial capacity in order to access more resources for all. Needless to say, as the federalist movement rises to the challenge of unification, the ideas of democracy and autonomy first pioneered in Nanchong shall serve as a basis by which we shall enlighten the people of China."

Indeed, since the foundation of the Republic in 1911, President Zhang has opposed any encroaching authoritarianism that has crept into the halls of Zhangnanhai. After the fall of Yuan Shikai's paltry attempt at establishing his own autocratic dynasty, Zhang Lan supported the Constitutional Protection Movement and the Guangzhou Government, declaring that a provisional constitution was instrumental to the foundations of a stable republic.\n\nAlthough Zhang Lan attempted to end the fractious infighting between the Sichuan warlords, he was unable to stem the fighting, until the recent Federalist Convention called by Xiong which saw him elevated to the Presidency. However, Zhang also understands the tenuous position of his government. The truce called after the fall of the Accelerated Department has not stopped minor skirmishes between Sichuan's military factions. This has motivated President Zhang to undertake significant efforts to coordinate the civilian and military officials as a more united movement.\n\nIn a move to portray unity, Prime Minister Xiong Kewu has affirmed the President's reforms, declaring them to be beneficial to the stability of [ROOT.GetNameDef].

During the Zhili Hegemony, Xiong found himself forced from the pentarchy established by Yang Sen, Liu Xiang, and the Baoding Department Triumvirate.\n\nHowever, after Yang faced a challenge from Liu Xiang's wing of the Accelerated Department, Xiong was able to capitalise on the provincial infighting to once again emerge as Sichuan's pre-eminent warlord. As Prime Minister of the Sichuan Federalist Government, Xiong has integrated his 9-Man Regiment faction with the Grand Republican Alliance, a coalition party composed of various primarily southern parties opposed to the Beiyang order which has operated as the chief Federalist political organisation since 1931.\n\nWhile Xiong has concentrated his efforts on keeping the Federal Government united under himself and Zhang Lan, he has had Dan Maoxin utilised their shared influence in the GRA to keep its internal factions as aligned as possible to the National Reconstruction Government's interests, and has leveraged their political support to keep the other warlords from gaining too much influence in the Zhang Lan Administration."

Throughout the decade, the Baoding Department under Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, and Liu Wenhui were able to become one of the major factions within Sichuan's political structure, becoming three of Sichuan's \"Five Giants.\"\n\nHowever, when the League collapsed and Zhili authority retreated into their Northern heartland, Yang Sen found his government toppled, and Baoding entered uncharted waters. Liu Wenhui was able to emerge from the carnage with the most influence intact, while Deng and Tian emerged floundering. Having actively cooperated with Xiong Kewu and Li Jiayu's officers, Liu has found himself no longer in a triumvirate with Deng and Song, but as the principal leader of the Baoding Department.\n\nWithin the National Reconstruction Government, Liu has promoted himself as one of the Federal Government's chief military strategists, advocating for the Federal Government to restructure the military around the lines of Jiang Baili's proposed Militaristic State-People reform. Liu has also formulated his own vision of governance, which he has described as the \"Three Advancement Principles\", and the \"Three Transformation Policies.\" For Liu, the Three Advancement Principles call for cautious advancement, gradual advancement, and rapid advancement, while the Three Transformation Policies call for replacing conquest with transformation, division with assimilation, and indirect control with progressive development."

 sichuan_events.525.d: "While many assumed that the Federalists could not come back from the loss of Yunnan and Guangdong, President Zhang Lan and Prime Minister Xiong Kewu have proved them all wrong. In a shocking twist of events, the National Reconstruction Government based in Sichuan was able to break the stronghold of the Beiyang Warlords, putting Beijing in the hands of a southern-led government, a feat not even the Xinhai Revolutionaries could achieve.\n\nArriving in Beijing to a jubilant crowd, Xiong Kewu declared to the masses that this would only be the start of the National Reconstruction Government's unification campaign. While the National Reconstruction is undoubtedly the strongest government claiming to represent China, it must see the nation entirely united before it claims true success. As President Zhang Lan organises Beijing's new government, Premier Xiong Kewu prepares the military for China's final struggle."

 sichuan_events.600.t: "Victory for National Reconstruction"
 sichuan_events.600.d: "Only a few years prior, it seemed that democracy in China was on the cusp of extinction, overrun either by opportunistic reactionaries or revolutionary autocrats. However, today the Federal Government of China stretches from the frigid Northeast to the mountains of Guangxi. Although rightfully recognised as a triumphant victory of both the China Democratic League and the Grand Republican Alliance, the government is both paradoxically at its zenith, as well as overlooking the precipice of a mounting crisis.\n\nWhile none can deny that the Federalist Government controls most of China, victory has whittled away at the unity of Zhang Lan's government. Xiong Kewu's plethora of GRA allies are unlikely to remain content to remain in the shadow of Zhang Lan and the CDL, and the President must work to secure his gains or see the federal government trip at perhaps its most crucial hour."
 sichuan_events.600.a: "Unification was secured by the idealistic resolve of President Zhang!"
 sichuan_events.600.b: "Xiong Kewu is the sword of victory for our movement!"

 sichuan_events.601.t: "Cruel Realities of the Military"
 sichuan_events.601.d: "While the Federal military began composed of a coalition of warlord forces, Zhang's governmental reforms and an impressive amount of luck kept the Federal military largely intact during the Chinese Civil War and War of Resistance against Japan. However, with unification finally having been undertaken, the fractious army has finally begun fully breaking down. Although President Zhang Lan has proposed military demobilisation to deal with the bloated military force, he has found difficulty in persuading the military to go along with it. Due to the high prevalence of warlord influence in his government, Zhang Lan has found great difficulty in regulating the Federal military.\n\nPrime Minister Xiong Kewu, keen on exploiting the crisis, has criticised the President for fracturing the hard-fought unity of the Federal Government. With the underlying tensions between the Prime Minister and the President finally boiling over, there have been rumours of a potential coup being formulated by disgruntled military officers, possibly led by Liu Wenhui. Liu for his part has reframed from outright criticising the President, and has taken a more ambivalent stance towards the demobilisation campaign. To outside observers, it has become apparent that the Zhang Lan government and its grand coalition has become untenable."

 sichuan_events.602.t: "Crippling Economic Downturns"
 sichuan_events.602.d: "While China once boasted one of the world's largest economies, the Century of Humiliation has relegated our crippled nation to one of the most undeveloped economies in the world. While coastal regions saw modest growth during the Zhili Hegemony, the agrarian hinterland remained in a backwards state. Whatever economic reform undertaken by the various provincial warlords have seen what little progress existed destroyed by the near-constant state of warfare China found itself in following the collapse of the League in 1936, and the War of Resistance against the Empire of Japan caused the Chinese economy to enter into a state of hyperinflation. With paper money quickly becoming worthless, people have begun to use a crude system of bartering, until the government is able to stem the developing economic crisis."

 sichuan_events.603.d: "The Sichuan Federalist Government was remarkable for its level of success in unifying China, despite the mutual hostility of the various factions within the Zhang Lan Administration. The coming elections announced by the Federal Government have not helped in mending the fraying government. As election campaigning intensifies, partisanship has only become more rife within Zhang Lan's administration.\n\nThe President, to the surprise of many, has declared his intent to run for re-election. This move was met with a mixed reaction within China Democratic League, with many prominent members of the CDL criticising the move. However, unable to agree on any other suitable candidate, the party has largely fallen behind Zhang's Presidential campaign.\n\nMeanwhile within the Grand Republican Alliance's camp, Premier Xiong has largely pulled out of active governance, focusing on the electoral campaign. With Xiong still refusing to run as President, the GRA campaign has focused on making Recognising that a Presidential run under his name may be marred by perceptions of it being a blatant power grab, Xiong has pushed his right-hand Dan Maoxin to be the GRA Presidential candidate.\n\nIn Northern China, Liu Wenhui has found a surprising amount of supporters, especially amongst Ex-Beiyang officers who see him as a symbol of stable governance. However, Liu Wenhui has thus far refused to overtly run for President, instead hoping to be made Minister of War of the electoral victor, whoever that ends up being."

 sichuan_events.604.t: "National Reconstruction Falters"
 sichuan_events.604.d: "With relations between President Zhang Lan and Prime Minister Xiong Kewu at an alltime low, the National Reconstruction Government finds itself in a uniquely weak position. With China once again engulfed in another political crisis, perhaps it falls to [ROOT.GetLeader] to pick up the pieces and stake his claim on the Republic, and save it from this motley bunch of squabbling fools\n\n[ROOT.GetLeader] understands the risk in revolting, but he also understands that there may never be a better opportunity. However, [ROOT.GetLeader] also knows that challenging the Federal Government may be regarded by the people of China as nothing more than a selfish warlord attempting to once again plunge the nation into chaos, and result in him being remembered as one of the nation's greatest villains for ten thousand years."

 sichuan_events.605.d: "With the schism between Xiong Kewu's Grand Republican Alliance and Zhang Lan's China Democratic League growing larger by the day, the disintegrating unity of the National Reconstruction Government has left ambitious warlords and governors with a small window of opportunity to strike.\n\nIndeed, it seems that [FROM.GetLeader] in particular has seized upon the opportunity, declaring President Zhang Lan and Premier Xong Kewu's infighting to be plaguing the Republican government, and has declared himself as the head of a provisional government that will end infighting in China."
 sichuan_events.605.a: "What does he think he's doing!?"
 sichuan_events.605.b: "So much for Democrat Unity."

 sichuan_events.610.t: "Retreat of the Iron-footed general"
 sichuan_events.610.d: "After a long period of increasing tensions in the National Reconstruction Government, Prime Minister Xiong has formally declared his exit from the Zhang Lan Administration. Following this, a slew of Grand Republican Alliance-aligned officials also tendered their resignations. The mass exit has left a substantial power vacuum within the government, with many in the China Democratic League attempting to fill in the vacant positions. Perhaps at the centre of the most intrigue in the Zhang Lan Administration is the Premiership.\n\nTacitly understood that the succeeding Prime Minister would likely be retained by Zhang after the election, many high ranking members of the CDL have attempted to put their own names forward as potential candidates. Among them, Zhang Junmai, Huang Yanpei, Luo Longji, and Tang Hualong were the most popular choices. However, in a surprising and controversial move, Zhang Lan has instead chosen Xian Ying, a fellow Sichuan native to be his PM. A longtime associate and friend of the President, Xian Ying's ascension has been interpreted by many as a sign of further consolidation of the CDL under its Sichuanese members."

 sichuan_events.611.d: "The China Democratic League, though only formed shortly after the National Reconstruction Government's capture of Beijing, found its origins in the Federation of Chinese Democratic Parties. The FDCP, which was formed by various liberal, democratic, and progressive elements following Zhili victory against the Fengtian Clique, was organised to form a democratic political opposition to the Zhili Clique. The FDCP fractured following the 1932 League Uprising, when Cao Kun cancelled the 1933 elections. Many of the parties and societies which left the FDCP ended up in Southern China, and coalesced around the already-established Federalist Movement. Though composed of various conservative, liberal, and socialist elements, the CDL has found itself drifting to the left under Zhang Lan's leadership. Despite this, the CDL has largely remained intact thus far, due to Zhang Lan's inscrutable commitment to true democracy, and his steadfast opposition to all forms of authoritarianism. Zhang Lan's chairmanship has seen him champion the autonomy of parties partaking in the league, while affirming its goals of achieving genuine democracy."

 sichuan_events.611.b: "Little more than a collection of dreamers."

 sichuan_events.612.t: "The Role of Liangism In the New China"
 sichuan_events.612.d: "During Emperor Guangxu's ambitious Hundred Days' Reform, above all other reformists stood Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao. Championing the ideas of a modern constitutional monarchy, Kang and Liang were forced to flee China when Empress Dowager Cixi alongside Yuan Shikai confined the Emperor to house arrest.\n\nWhile Kang remained a fervent royalist for the rest of his life, Liang came to the realisation that China's future lay with a republic, and espoused the German Bismarckian ideology of state socialism. During the Republic's history, Liang and his disciples emerged as some of the most influential thinkers, contesting Sun Yat-sen's more revolutionary brand of politics.\n\nLiang's political height came during the Anhui Clique's rule, where he and the Research Clique helped formulate the Anfu Party State's developmentalist policies and structure, before he fell out with Premier Duan Qirui. In the 20s, Liang drifted left, briefly becoming fascinated with reformist strands of socialism. One of Liang's final political moves was to establish the Chinese Constitutionalist Party, which was helmed by Xu Qin following his death.\n\nWhile the CCP tentatively cooperated with the Zhili Clique until their reorganisation into the DCP, Liang's disciple Zhang Junmai established the Democratic Socialist Party in Southern China in staunch opposition to Beijing. Although not directly politically descended from Liang, the Young China Party has claimed him as their spiritual leader as well. Although regarded as a divisive figure, few will shun his achievements to China's political development."
 sichuan_events.612.a: "Liang's words shall continue to guide China into the future!"
 sichuan_events.612.b: "Liangism has run its course."

 sichuan_events.613.t: "Zhang Junmai Contests Zhang Lan"
 sichuan_events.613.d: "Although Zhang Lan's Presidential campaign has been accepted by most within the China Democratic League at this point, there remain those who refuse to support him. Among them stands Zhang Junmai, leader of the Democratic Socialist Party. Although both men claim to follow strands of socialism, many have noted Zhang Junmai's more conservative stance and his assertive personality.\n\nAn egotistical man unsuited to working with others, Zhang Junmai has greatly resented the dominance of Sichuanese intellectuals within the League, regarding them as bit players who have only risen this far due to coincidence. Calling forth his party allies, as well as the other Liangist parties in the Democratic Constitutionalist Party and Young China Party, Zhang has declared his own Presidential Campaign.\n\nPulling from the same base, Zhang Junmai has attempted to sap the CDL support base away from Zhang Lan and the CDL, to the President's frustration. The infighting between the CDL and the Liangists has greatly crippled the CDL's ability to function. Capitalising upon this, Dan, Xiong and the Grand Republican Alliance have captured the initiative and now stand poised to dominate the electoral process, with many fearing that the GRA may go insofar as to rig the election itself, especially amongst Li Jiayu's Officer Department."
 sichuan_events.613.a: "Zhang Junmai is the gift that keeps on giving."
 sichuan_events.613.b: "Zhang Junmai with his pride and his ego!"

 sichuan_events.614.t: "Expressing China's Safeguard"
 sichuan_events.614.d: "With the China Democratic League in the midst of a civil war with Zhang Lan and Zhang Junmai fighting over leadership and the Grand Republican Alliance poised to win a blowout victory and rumours abound about their ambitions to end the fragile democracy in place, Liu Wenhui has asserted his prerogative as the largest and most powerful independent warlord within the National Reconstruction Government.\n\nLiu has called on the Grand Republican Alliance to end their pretensions of eroding federal democracy and the China Democratic League to keep its infighting from causing hyper partisanship. Liu has ominously warned that should this not occur, then he will force their hand to protect democratic institutions and the interests of the Chinese people. This has led to the public reacting worrisomely to the potential of a Liu Wenhui coup, while officials in government fear the sorts of careerists and opportunists who may ride Liu Wenhui's prospective coup to the top of Chinese government."
 sichuan_events.614.a: "Zhang Lan intensifies his campaign against Zhang Junmai."
 sichuan_events.614.b: "Xiong Kewu throws Liu Wenhui's letter in the trash."

 sichuan_events.620.t: "Last Light of Chinese Democracy"
 sichuan_events.620.d: "For whatever reasons, be they that the Republic became inflamed with the hyper partisanship wrought by CDL infighting or that the Grand Republican Alliance overtly plotted to bring down Chinese democracy before it had a chance to live, it seems that neither the CDL nor the GRA will find themselves victorious. In the past few hours, soldiers from the Baoding Department and other warlord armies seized strategic locations around the country and local polling stations. Meanwhile Liu Wenhui personally oversaw the seizure of President Zhang, the Cabinet, Xiong Kewu, and Dan Maoxin. In a nationwide announcement, Liu declared the overturning of the elections. Liu also formally announced his own bid for election in the interim, knowing that he will essentially run uncontested with all of his viable opponents under house arrest. Although a blatant power grab, few seem actually willing to oppose him, with many either fearing a new font of radicalism without Liu's intervention or find themselves too apathetic to care. Already, former Zhili officials have come out of semi-retirement to support Liu's bid, and it seems that the destroyed Beiyang order has re-asserted itself once more."
 sichuan_events.620.a: "Pollice Compresso Favor Iudicabatur."

 sichuan_events.621.t: "Hammer Striking the Anvil"
 sichuan_events.621.d: "For whatever reasons, be they that the Republic became inflamed with the passions of hyperpartisan squabbling, or that the Republic found itself engulfed in the waves of apathy, it seems that Chinese experiment with democracy has come to a sudden halt. In the past few hours, soldiers from the Baoding Department and other warlord armies seized strategic locations around the country and major governmental buildings in the capital. Minister of War Liu Wenhui, chief architect of this coup, personally oversaw the seizure of the President, his Cabinet, and the leading opposition.\n\nVery few figures have openly opposed Liu's coup, due to his careful politicking in the background and in his capacity with the cabinet. Managing to wrangle consensus with a few dissenters quickly shut down by group pressure, Liu has been swiftly sworn in as President. Surprisingly popular with the people, President Liu has managed to wrangle his own political machine as a form of \"Heavy-Handed democracy.\" Calling upon support from the gentry, peasants, military, Liu has quickly garnered a reputation as a man of the people who acted decisively to save the Republic."
 sichuan_events.621.a: "Thus, Liu represents the voice of the people."

 sichuan_events.630.t: "The Old Dispensation"
 sichuan_events.630.d: "Though he has always aimed to match the actions of the idealists around him, Liu Wenhui has more often than not found himself acting out of pragmatism and opportunism than he would like. Opportunism has always been a problem for China in Liu's eyes, and even as a new government is swept in, like so many before it, he cannot help but feel a slight disappointment. Did Yuan Shikai not try to seize power out of opportunism? Did the actions of scheming warlords not emerge from that same very place? Even in his own ranks, did his army not shrink and swell based on Liu's own fortunes?\n\nAs the Civil Governance and Progress Society rolls out its attempts at reform, Liu has watched helplessly as his colleagues each worked to stymie his more progressive policies, despite his greatest efforts. Back in Chengdu, thousands of miles away from the capital, reports and petitions have made their way onto Liu's desk, detailing Deng's speeches blatantly slamming the inefficiency of democracy, the staffing of old despotic lackeys into provincial posts and, of course, the nefarious machinations of Liu Wencai.\n\nNevertheless, Liu has worked tirelessly to address the concerns of his many critics and soothe tensions with an opposition frequently harassed by Liu's cronies, who utilise their new statuses to act with impunity and stifle the fledgling democratic apparatus. But perhaps this is merely a phenomenon seen in every administration's early days, all of which will settle like dust after the spring rain. What remains important is to observe the path ahead, to strive amidst hardship, to set ambitious goals and above all, to work diligently in all things. Liu may not be a perfect man, nor even an idealist like so many in the federalist movement, but his conviction remains that of a patriot, someone who keeps with the spirit of the November Riots and of China. Though China may never free itself of societal expediency, and those who act in self-interest will always plot in the shadows, pessimism will never be a solution."
 sichuan_events.630.a: "A nation needs builders, not merely critics."

 sichuan_events.631.t: "Democracy Eternally Remembered"
 sichuan_events.631.d: "The road towards federalism from Sichuan has certainly not been an easy one, constantly harassed and betrayed in the seemingly endless provincial struggle as local autocrats regularly outnumbered them. Frequently forced from their home province, Xiong and his men would only survive through the kindness of their republican brethren, though even that wasn't without its own disagreements. But look at how far they had come, the last flickering flame of a federalist dream that had not been stamped out, despite the time.\n\nNow the torch has been passed to Dan Maoxin, a new face on the political stage but a veteran of the republican struggle nonetheless, having been comrades with Xiong Kewu since the late 1910s. Owing to his legacy as a proponent for civil discussion and non-partisan unity, his dealings with independent republicans, the Political Science Clique and moderate members of the opposition have all earned him great praise as the \"man of letters\" China has so desperately needed after decades of despotic or fragmented rule. However, China is still new to this system, and whether Dan and his cabinet can stave off the excesses of leftist radicals, conservative subversives and a collapse of the coalition by its own doing, is still unknown. Democracy, both on a local and national scale, is yet to be fully realised across the distant frontiers, as the local strongmen that remain try to consolidate control and those who favour immediate action abstain from or act against the system.\n\nOf course, the current methods still show promise, and the federalist framework may be the way China rules itself for centuries to come, lest it simply be as fleeting as China's other attempts at democracy or even democratic reform. Compromise is hard to maintain and coalitions will inevitably shift, but it's the disagreements that make such a system so salient, coming part and parcel with such an open marketplace of ideas and opinions after all."
 sichuan_events.631.a: "Our ideals are something we must continue to struggle for."

 sichuan_events.632.t: "Benevolence and Righteousness"
 sichuan_events.632.d: "Ever since the ailing days of the Qing and the fragmented republic that followed, many in the West have deemed China a backward nation that had been lost to the clutches of infighting and despotism. Certainly, in some respects, it has rung true, no place more than in Sichuan, itself torn apart by local warlords for decades. Through such strife, Zhang Lan has witnessed it all, the emaciated peasants crushed under taxes, the few businessmen leaving the province for more prosperous opportunities in the East and, of course, the various military men who fought each other back and forth across the Red Basin.\n\nHaving navigated the political landscape of China and personally led the modern federalist movement to national prominence, Zhang has realised the need not only for Western ideas; that of democracy for all, freedom of thought and intellectual independence, but also the need for virtues championed by Chinese philosophers many millennia ago. First is the idea of benevolence, which Zhang believed many of the republic's previous leaders lacked, despite being cunning, smart and courageous, they neither won the hearts of the people nor worked in the interest of the masses. But of course, benevolence alone has often been misguided in China, the stumbling bureaucracy of Beiyang, the revolutionary zealotry of the KMT and the populism of warlords alike all claimed to be for the grandiose goal of National Salvation, but failed to act steadily, justly and fairly enough to win the people over. The Chinese Democratic League, however, is the culmination of both these ideas, standing on the side of the nation, striving for unity, both saving the country and building it anew as it marches on into the new century.\n\nOf course, even as the guns fall silent across China and the people ready themselves for the fruits of democracy to come, Zhang and his colleagues remain ever vigilant of the various forces that seek to rip away the agency of the masses. For Zhang, this enthusiasm must continue to be utilised, harnessed and nurtured from the masses, because what is reform, if not a steady revolution of its own?"

However, Yuan would emerge victorious, and Liu went into exile in Shanghai.

Selected to study in Japan in 1903, he would enter Tokyo Hongwen Academy, returning to China after Anti-Cixi remarks. Serving in various teaching roles, he was elected to the Sichuan Advisory Council in 1909 but refused to accept the position, instead opting to serve in the reformist constitutionalist movement in the twilight years of the Qing.\n\nParticipating in the Sichuan Railway Protection Movement, he would become immersed in the Xinhai foray of Sichuan, before being elected as a Member of the Assembly in 1913. In 1915 he would participate in the National Protection War, before becoming Beijing governor of Sichuan in 1917; fleeing from Chengdu with Liu Cunhou in 1918, and later returning to Beijing. In 1919 he would support the New Culture Movement, and aid in sending young students to the radical intellectual scene of Europe.\n\nIn 1920 he would return to Nanchong, devoting himself to education, and in 1925 even became president of Chengdu University. Advocating freedom of thought and academic freedom, he enabled the various functions of local revolutionary groups under his auspices. Resigning in 1932 over the Zhili Suppression of the Shanghai Uprising, he would return to Nanchong to work on education matters.

He became intrigued by the ideas of democracy and modernism presented by the West and lamented that China had fallen gravely behind the rest of the world. In 1903, he attended the Sichuan East Literature Hall and later became acquainted with revolutionaries such as Dai Jitao. After achieving the sponsorship of his uncle, Xiong went to study in Japan, where he met Sun Yat-sen and would later join Sun's Tongmenghui. After the Xinhai Revolution, Xiong served as commander of the Dahan Sichuan Military Government until 1913. Yuan Shikai and the Beiyang Government expelled Sun's forces from China, and Xiong was forced to flee to Japan in exile.\n\nYet, the defeat did not deter Xiong from dreaming of a free China. In Japan and Southeast Asia, he raised funds for the revolution and returned to China to join Cai E in the victorious National Protection War against Yuan. Despite being comrades in the National Protection War, Xiong turned against his former ally Lü Chao in 1920 and successfully expelled him from the province with the help of the warlord Liu Cunhou. In that same year, he issued a firm declaration that the people of Sichuan would no longer play second fiddle to the Beiyang and Guangzhou Governments that had arisen in the chaos of the Warlord Period. This did not last long as Sichuan collapsed into civil war and Liu Cunhou joined forces with the Beiyang Government, and Xiong was once again forced to flee into exile. He then fled to Guangdong, joining the Chinese Kuomintang, and participated in its first Congress in 1924.\n\nXiong's brief stay in the Kuomintang ended in 1925 when he was betrayed by Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek on charges that he was colluding with the Chinese Federalist leader Chen Jiongming. After the Northern Expedition's failure and the Kuomintang's breakdown, Xiong returned home to Sichuan dissatisfied with political life. And yet his passion for republican ideals never died, and although he has not forgotten the betrayal of the KMT, he lends an open ear to the Chinese Federalists in Guangdong."

Like many others from his province, in 1910, he attended the Baoding Academy, which he then left when the Xinhai Revolution broke out in 1911. He then travelled to Shanghai, where he worked with Chen Qimei, Wang Jingwei, and Li Shizeng (prominent associates of Dr. Sun) until he was forced to flee to Sichuan in exile after Yuan Shikai took power.\n\nIn 1915, the National Protection War to resist Yuan's regime in Beijing broke out, and Lü joined fellow Sichuanese Xiong Kiwu as part of Cai E's army in Sichuan. When Chen Jiongming and the Federalist movement attempted to kick Sun Yat-sen out of Guangdong, Lü took the side of Sun and fought against his former comrade Xiong Kiwu for control of Sichuan. He then joined Sun in exile in Shanghai and returned with Sun in his return to Guangdong in 1923 and became one of Sun's trusted allies in the Kuomintang. During the doomed Northern Expedition, Lü represented the Sichuanese forces, and after the mission's failure, he fled back to his native Sichuan in exile once more. Yet, despite numerous defeats, the revolutionary spirit installed within Lü never died out. Instead, he continued to bide his time, believing fervently in the principles illustrated by the late eternal premier of the Kuomintang.

Although a member of the Tongmenghui during the Qing years, Tian aligned with Yuan Shikai during the Second Revolution of 1913. Liu Cunhou ultimately aligned against Yuan in the National Protection War a few years later, and Tian served as a captain. In 1917, Liu launched a campaign to retake Chengdu, and successfully took Chongqing and ousted the Yunnan and Guizhou forces in Sichuan.\n\nIn December, Tang Jiyao reignited the war and pushed Liu out of Chengdu. Beijing reorganised Liu's army into the 21st division and Tian was made Major General. By the end of the year, Liu put Tian in control of the 21st division. Liu made an alliance with Liu Xiang, and together they pushed Xiong Kewu out of Sichuan. In 1920, Xiong and Liu made an alliance against Yunnan, and they pushed Yunnanese forces out of Sichuan. The following year, Xiong allied with Liu Xiang and they pushed Liu out of Sichuan.\n\nTian's 21st division was folded into the new Sichuanese power structure. In 1922, Liu Xiang was defeated by Liu Chengxun and he took control of most of Liu Xiang's former domain. Deng Xihou of the Baoding Department was unhappy with the division of the spoils, and convinced fellow Baoding graduate Tian to join him against Liu, which saw the coalition win.

Xiong Kewu's expulsion from Sichuan, first by Yunnan-Guizhou forces, then by the other warlords of Sichuan, would result in Xiang working with the nascent Baoding Department.\n\nDe jure a subordinate to Liu Wenhui, in practice, Xiang would play the role of an autonomous actor merely privy to Baoding interests. It would be this dynamic that resulted in Xiang Chuanyi being appointed as head of the Three Army Command Office in 1925, when the Baoding Department controlled Chengdu, a method of compromise for the triumvirate jostling for power. In this role, Xiang was responsible for dialogue between Liu, Deng and Tian while also unofficially being the police chief and head of the militia. While the Command Office has since been relocated to Ya'an due to hostilities with Yang Sen, Xiang's duties have remained mostly the same.§!"

He attended Sichuan's military academy in 1903, went on to study in Japan in 1907, and returned to Sichuan after Graduating in 1908. He made a name for himself during the Xinhai Revolution where he initially led smaller anti-bandit forces and went on to lead larger forces as his loyalty earned him the trust of his superiors. During the conflicts he participated in, however, his forces were often more concerned with extorting wealth from the locals than functioning as a proper military force. While his soldiers often behaved like bandits, he's managed to strong-arm himself into a position of relative power in Sichuan in the process, though he's hardly endeared himself to the people.\n\nDuring the Sichuanese civil war, Liu Cunhou hardly contributed to the Armament Department's breakthroughs, though his forces were plentiful enough to exploit the ones that were created during the conflict. As he was mostly experienced in anti-banditry operations, his forces spent most of the war flushing out Kuomintang loyalists and mopping up routed remnants of Liu Xiang's faction of the Accelerated Department. Thanks to this, his forces were left in a relatively unscathed state compared to the rest of the Armament Department, eventually allowing him to outmanoeuvre his supposed ally Yang Sen once the dust of the war had settled.\n\nHis reign as a governor of Sichuan would end up being little more than his de-facto banditry on a larger scale.

He went on to lead a series of anti-bandit raids and would earn the trust of his superiors, enough so that he'd eventually go on to lead provisional armies. It is, however, speculated that this had less to do with his abilities as a commander and was rather a question of him seeming loyal in a time of conflict and chaos.\n\nWhile he was able to successfully pacify bandits and earn the trust of his superiors, he earned nothing but disdain from the locals as his armies would behave no better than the bandits they were supposed to fight. Wherever his forces went, they would effectively run a protection racket against the locals. Greedy and less concern with discipline than military doctrine, he's held in poor regard by most of his peers and was seen as a man largely devoid of military acumen through most of his career. Be that as it may, he was still the epitome of a ruthless warlord and managed to amass wealth and a powerbase to be reckoned with.\n\nHe was eventually subordinated to Yang Sen and tasked with maintaining order in the north of the country.

He rose through the ranks and would eventually lead a large contingent of Sichuanese forces against the Kuomintang during the Northern Expedition. During this conflict he managed to gain a reputation as a skilled, albeit reckless, commander with numerous victories to his name. Once the Northern Expedition had been soundly defeated, he returned to Sichuan and was assigned to Chongqing as the head of the city's garrison.\n\nWhile his performance during this conflict allowed him to establish his own clique and remain a force to be reckoned with within Sichuan, he was never granted the governorship of the province that he felt that he deserved. Instead, he was made a subordinate to Yang Sen, a loyal stooge of Wu Peifu and the Zhili. Liu Xiang saw this as an insult and petty cronyism. As a result, he began to harbour a deep resentment towards both Yang Sen and the Zhili and their puppets in the Armament Department.\n\nThis resentment eventually led to him seizing the moment after the collapse of the Qing hegemony in the early days of 1936. After successfully rallying his subordinates in the Accelerated Department against Yang Sen, Liu Xiang managed to claim Chengdu for himself and defeat both the Armament and Baoding departments through a series of daring military gambles during the Sichuanese Civil War.
