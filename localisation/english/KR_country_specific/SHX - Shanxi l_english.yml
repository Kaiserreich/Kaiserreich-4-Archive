 #Major Parties
 SHX_authoritarian_democrat_party: "Guominjun"
 SHX_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Guominjun\n§LThe Guominjun (National Army) or Northwest Army is the name of the armed faction controlled by the warlord Feng Yuxiang. While ideologically similar to the Kuomintang, they were independent of one another due to geographical isolation. What makes Feng's army unique is the Guominjun's stringent discipline, strong ideological motivation, and excellent training - all of which have made it well known throughout China. Underlying the discipline and motivations of Feng's soldiers is their loyalty to Feng. Still, interestingly enough, a substantial number of Christian and quasi-socialist tones can be found throughout the Guominjun ranks due to Feng's faith (despite his conviction that a soldier of the Guominjun need not be a Christian). After facing near collapse battling the Fengtian Clique and the Zhili Clique in the anti-Fengtian war, Feng was forced to withdraw the Guominjun remnants to Shanxi Province, ruled by the warlord Yan Xishan. While the two men share a pragmatic alliance of sorts, the Guominjun continue to remain the provinces' largest armed force - a fact that Feng will most certainly employ to his advantage.§!\n"

 SHX_paternal_autocrat_party: "Yan Clique"
 SHX_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "Yan Clique\n§LYan Xishan's clique is built around the cult of the \"Model Governor\", and has survived the turbulence of the last few decades of Chinese disunity. The governor has promoted a syncretic ideology which he claims combines the best of \"militarism, nationalism, anarchism, democracy, capitalism, socialism, individualism, imperialism, universalism, paternalism, and utopianism\". In practice, however, Yan Xishan has promoted a statist, autocratic government along neo-Confucian lines, reflecting his fickle, authoritarian and traditionalist approach towards modernisation, no doubt influenced by his studies in Japan. Yan has so far left a mixed legacy leaving behind many half-finished reforms. His support base consists of the bureaucracy, often consisting of loyalists of questionable competence, and also the gentry with which he shares ambivalent relations. Efforts to generate a popular base for his reforms have mostly been stalled by Yan's intransigence towards large-scale changes and regular competition with the Guominjun, an alliance he has grown to resent.§!\n"

 #Minor Parties
 SHX_totalist_party: "BIS (Jiaocheng)"
 SHX_totalist_party_long: "BIS (Jiaocheng County Cell)\n§LIt is well known that Dai Chunfeng's reach extends to the farthest corners of China, piercing even the high mountains that protect the Shanxi Clique. Qiao Jiacai is a Shanxi native who enthusiastically organised the Jiaocheng County branch of the KMT in 1925 before running away from home to attend Whampoa on the eve of the Northern Expedition. During the expedition, he managed to secretly return home to Shanxi and built a cell around his former Jiaocheng comrades to prepare for the ultimate KMT takeover. They never got their chance, and about a decade later this secretive group remains in hiding. Qiao, it would appear, has established some contact with a broader network of KMT informants around the country, but with who and how many he keeps close to his chest. His agents rarely cooperate with other KMT groups in the area, sticking to themselves and the shadows. Away from the prying eyes of Shanxi's bickering strongmen, this underground network operates from Luliang - awaiting the day that the KMT returns.§!\n"
 SHX_syndicalist_party: "Syndicalist Sympathisers"
 SHX_syndicalist_party_long: "Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Syndicalist Youth League\n§LOfficially organised into the 'Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Syndicalist Youth League', Syndicalism has found little traction in the mostly conservative Shanxi. Their only success has been their partial sway over the Taiyuan Municipal Labour Union, under the shadow of more elder Kuomintang activists aligned with the Reorganised faction. Pan Zili was a student radical growing up in the chaos of the 1920s, joining an artillery battalion before attempting to organise student protests against Yan's rule. He fled to France in 1925 to study at the Sun Yat-sen University in Paris, before returning home in 1933. Little more than an offshoot of the already fringe KMT remnant in Shanxi, this CSP branch represents the manifestation of the extreme of student radicalism in the province. Indeed, it finds itself more of a political boogeyman for Yan's screeds against societal disorder than a practical revolutionary movement.§!\n"
 SHX_radical_socialist_party: "Kuomintang (RCA)"
 SHX_radical_socialist_party_long: "Kuomintang (Reorganised Comrades Association)\n§LFew people dare to be openly socialist in Shanxi clique territories out of fear of repression from Yan's forces. Most embed themselves within the Guominjun, and work to indoctrinate, train and then smuggle KMT sympathisers out of the province to Fujian. This wing of the region's Kuomintang tends to have greater reach in Shanxi itself, despite their leadership being based in Shaanxi, with many urban socialists first entering the revolutionary ranks through study clubs in Taiyuan. The effort is spearheaded by Hu Jingtong, a relatively minor officer in the GMJ sympathetic to Wang Jingwei and his central committee. Protected by Guominjun leadership, particularly Hu Jingyi (the eldest brother of the Hu family), this branch of the Kuomintang awaits the day in which the revolution will liberate Shanxi.§!\n"
 SHX_social_democrat_party: "Kuomintang (PAC)"
 SHX_social_democrat_party_long: "Kuomintang (Provisional Action Committee)\n§LGiven the appalling conditions of Shanxi's farmers, it is no surprise that what little KMT popular support in Shanxi congregates around the more agrarian wing of the party. Operating under the front organisation of the \"Xi'an County Farmers' Association\", Wei Yechou has long been the de facto leader of the KMT in Shaanxi. He has mentored many socialist activists from Shaanxi as a middle school teacher and was invited to participate in the 1926 KMT National Congress, a distinction he remains proud of to this day. Although largely suppressed, Wei Yechou's farmers' associations and militias serve as some buffer against the exploitation of the gentry. Loosely affiliated with Song Qingling's faction of the KMT, Wei hopes that all the sacrifices his men have made will be for something.§!\n"
 SHX_social_liberal_party: "Student Association"
 SHX_social_liberal_party_long: "Shanxi Student Association\n§LIn the 1920s, Yan Xishan's efforts at expanding access to higher-level education backfired when his heavy-handed efforts to indoctrinate students provoked revolts at his middle schools and universities. Students, organised into a loosely unified but powerful 'Student Association' overwhelmed Taiyuan in a wave of anti-concessionist violence targeted at the West and Japan. They grew powerful enough to organise boycotts of schools and even forced Yan to fire his loyalist faculty at the People's Normal School - handing leadership over to the students. Zhao Pilian has since become principal of the Normal School, and has assumed some form of de facto leadership of the movement. Although largely stagnant as an organisation since their demonstrations over a decade ago, the Student Association remains a radical force that halts significant changes to the education system. Rampant student unemployment and lack of job prospects have made Yan desperate to bring them under control.§!\n"
 SHX_market_liberal_party: "Commercial Interests"
 SHX_market_liberal_party_long: "Beijing Commercial Interests\n§LShanxi used to have a very vibrant commerce and banking sector back in the 1700s and 1800s. So wealthy in fact, that the province was said to import most of its food and manufactured goods using the bullion they gained. Those days are gone, however, shattered by years of instability and war, and now Shanxi is one of the poorest provinces in China. Many merchants and bankers have gone out of business since the 1920s, and the province is unable to muster up sufficient domestic capital for meaningful investments. Instead, they rely on outsiders, a mixture of Beijing-aligned merchants and German investors led by the Pekin Syndicate (governed de facto by the Ostchina-Direktorium of the AOG). These investors have mainly taken over the piaohao (investment banks) that used to form the backbone of Shanxi's banking empire, becoming a rival to Yan's Provincial Bank of Shanxi. Despite the threat they pose to Yan's efforts at an autarkic, centralised financial system under the governor's control, foreign interests have ironically found a sympathetic ear to Wang Xiang. One of Yan's erstwhile lackeys, the General Manager of the Bank of Shanxi has been lured in by the promises of outside investment as a possible solution to Shanxi's chronic financial instability and budgetary shortfalls. He has pleaded with his master to open the door to outside commercial interests, even if it provokes the ire of the nationalists.§!\n"
 SHX_social_conservative_party: "Shang Clique"
 SHX_social_conservative_party_long: "Shang Zhen's Clique\n§LIt was not too long ago that the Tongmenghui surged throughout China, overthrowing the Qing monarchy and promising to bring a new Republican government to the land. Although that change did not pan out the way Sun intended, that does not mean that everyone has moved on from the dream. Embedded within the high command of Yan's clique is Shang Zhen, an early member of the Tongmenghui who met Dr Sun himself in Japan. He and some of his compatriots remain sympathetic to KMT ideals, albeit rejecting the radical turn of the Central Committee in France. He is noted as occasionally petitioning Yan to reach out to other KMT remnants, much to his boss's chagrin. However, Shang remains one of Yan's loyal commanders and a rare competent among a sea of political appointees. Their continued existence, ingrained within Yan's clique, reflects the lingering nationalistic and republican dream within Yan's government.§!\n"
 SHX_national_populist_party: "Heart Washing Society"
 SHX_national_populist_party_long: "The Heart Washing Society\n§LZhao Daiwen is one of the few living men Yan Xishan respects on a personal level, having been Yan's mentor and deeply influencing Yan's political philosophy. A well-read scholar, former Tongmenghui member and devout Buddhist, Zhao is credited as being the likely mastermind of Yan's neo-Confucian, syncretic turn. The Heart Washing Society is a product of Yan's effort at promoting a quasi-religion suitable for state interests. Despite its wide promotion, there are relatively few 'true believers', and when the government ceases to watch or mandate meetings attendance plummets. Still, the fanatics of the society continue to meet and this reactionary movement serves as a reminder of Yan's interests in fundamentally reforming society from the bottom up. These neo-Confucian societies are Yan's primary arm in countering GMJ influence among the people, and though they have not been quite up to par their presence is ubiquitous in the province.§!\n"

### Party Renames
 SHX_yan_authoritarian_democrat_party: "Shaanxi Army"
 SHX_yan_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Yang Hucheng's Shaanxi Army\n§LWith the utter defeat and expulsion of Feng Yuxiang from the province, the Guominjun has been irreversibly shattered. Most of the socialist elements have gone their own way, while many of Feng's closest confidants have followed him into exile. Others have elected to join Yan Xishan's government, seeking employment in any opportunity they could force their way into. A few remain defiant, however, rallying around Yang Hucheng. Yang is a native of Shaanxi and was a minor Guominjun commander under Sun Yue, through grew in prominence after the Guominjun's retreat into his home province. Hiding in the mountains of Shaanxi, they have nominally submitted to Yan's rule as the \"Shaanxi Army\" though in practice operate independently - hoping to preserve their once mighty army's autonomy. This has not shielded Yang from criticism, however, as many see even his nominal cooperation as a deep betrayal of the Guominjun cause even as he claims this is a necessary evil to protect his men. Whatever the case, it is clear that they will be of little trouble to Yan in the near future.§!\n"

 #Rename it to Jin clique not Shanxi clique Remnants to avoid any confusion with the tag Shanxi clique:
 SHX_feng_paternal_autocrat_party: "Jin Remnant"
 SHX_feng_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "The New Jin Clique\n§LWhen Yan Xishan's government collapsed under the weight of the Guominjun's advance, his followers scrambled to carve out their own piece of his empire. The Heart Washing Society fanatics have rallied under Yan's nephew Liang Huazhi, the provincial administration and gentry have mostly gone into exile with Wang Xiang, and the Shanxi Provincial Army has divided harshly between Yan's top commanders. Shang Zhen has splintered off with many of his men to join the Guominjun's new government, a move decried by many in the old administration as a betrayal. Fu Zuoyi and Xu Yongchang have meanwhile carved out their own fiefdom of old-guard Shanxi clique loyalists, nicknamed the New \"Jin\" clique after the province's shorthand name. While they are expected to cause some trouble with the new regime, it is unlikely it will amount to much in the end.§!\n"

 #Renamed party should Yan go Manchu coup:
 SHX_jia_jingde_remnant_party: "Yan Loyalists"
 SHX_jia_jingde_remnant_party_long: "Shanxi Provincial Government (in Exile)\n§LWith Yan Xishan's critical loyalists having been hastily evacuated from Taiyuan to his new power base in Beijing, what's left of his old administration has fallen into the hands of Jia Jingde, a long time member of the provincial bureaucracy and Secretary-General of the Governor's Office. He has since been appointed the acting Governor of Shanxi by Yan, ostensibly a reward for his long-time service, though one that rings rather hollow at the moment given the looming siege of Taiyuan by Guominjun forces.\n\nStill, he has rallied all the men he could around this cause, a mixture of remaining bureaucrats, gentry-backed anti-socialist militias, Confucian traditionalists, urban intellectuals and commercial interests, and whatever security forces he could scrape together. His past post as Director of the Shanxi Military and Political Law Enforcement Department serves him well in this case, though he has largely avoided direct command in the battles engulfing the province.§!\n"

 #Renamed Party Mid-Game:
 SHX_national_populist_sacrifice_league: "Sacrifice League"
 SHX_national_populist_sacrifice_league_long: "Blood and Iron National National Salvation Corps\n§LWith the war for Chinese unification raging, radicalised youths led by Liang Huazhi have been organised for the coming wars. Named after a smaller organisation Liang's uncle Yan Xishan formed while studying in Japan and modelled after the Dare-to-Die corps that dotted the nation during the Xinhai Revolution, this so-called \"Sacrifice League\" joins other radical battalions in their efforts to liberate the nation. Utterly fanatical and embracing martyrdom, their actual combat effectiveness varies tremendously.§!\n"

### Late Game Party Renames
 SHX_fringe_radicals: "Radicals"
 SHX_fringe_radicals_long: "Fringe Socialist Radicals\n§LThe allure of socialism extends all across China, from the mountains of Shanxi to the bustling streets of Shanghai - where many cling to the hopeful ideal of an egalitarian socialist China. Operating either under the radical elements of the Kuomintang or the Chinese Syndicalist Party, these extremist groups refuse to partake in the Chinese parliamentary system; seeing the newly proclaimed Central Government as merely a betrayal of the socialist revolution.§!\n"

 SHX_chinese_syndicalist_party: "CSP"
 SHX_chinese_syndicalist_party_long: "Chinese Syndicalist Party (Zhongguo Gong Tuan Dang)\n§LLargely confined to urban centres or port cities, the Chinese Syndicalist Party for years remained merely a fragmented junior party of the Chinese Kuomintang. However, with the recent unification of the Chinese nation, expatriate members of the CSP have returned from Europe to China. The party's fragmented differences have led to the creation of different cliques within its own movement such as the Orthodox faction led by Chen Duxiu and Li Lisan, the Radical Faction led by Chen Shaoyu, and other syndicalists such as Li Dazhao. Nonetheless, the CSP is hardly a major political force in the Chinese Republic - with its main strength and influence only among radical students and workers.§!\n"

 SHX_kuomintang: "KMT"
 SHX_kuomintang_long: "Chinese Kuomintang (Zhongguo Guomindang)\n§LThe Chinese Kuomintang is the party of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and claims to be the heir of Sun Yat-sen and Song Jiaoren's Nationalist Party in the early Beiyang Republic. After Song's death and Sun's subsequent multiple exiles, the party revived on October 10, 1919. The party is dedicated to the notion of Chinese nationalism under the leadership of the Kuomintang party-state and espouses a doctrine of the \"Three Principles of the People\" - Minzu, Minquan, and Minsheng (Nationalism, Democracy, and Welfare respectively). The Kuomintang attempted to unify China in 1925 with the Northern Expedition but the expedition's failure forced the party to flee across China or overseas. A traditionally \"big tent\" party, the Chinese KMT is largely dominated by its leftist members and as a result of China's recent unification - hope to establish a larger presence within the National Assembly.§!\n"

 SHX_kuomintang_feng: "KMT"
 SHX_kuomintang_feng_long: "Chinese Kuomintang (Zhongguo Guomindang)\n§LThe Chinese Kuomintang is the party of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and claims to be the heir of Sun Yat-sen and Song Jiaoren's Nationalist Party in the early Beiyang Republic. After Song's death and Sun's subsequent multiple exiles, the party revived on October 10, 1919. The party is dedicated to the notion of Chinese nationalism under the leadership of the Kuomintang party-state and espouses a doctrine of the \"Three Principles of the People\" - Minzu, Minquan, and Minsheng (Nationalism, Democracy, and Welfare respectively). The Kuomintang attempted to unify China in 1925 with the Northern Expedition but the expedition's failure forced the party to flee across China or overseas. A traditionally \"big tent\" party, constant infighting proved to be its downfall. However, under Feng Yuxiang's new leadership, it has seen its fortunes revive even as its older leadership has mostly been pushed out in favour of the Guominjun. The merger of the two factions has given stability to the party-state as it charts its revolutionary course.§!\n"

 SHX_independent_republicans_party: "Republicans"
 SHX_independent_republicans_party_long: "Independent Republicans\n§LMany politicians refuse to join political parties, seeing them as corrupt and restricting. Perhaps most prominent among them is New Culture intellectual Hu Shih, who proudly boasts of his independent status, and his ability to critique the government in an objective manner. Ever pragmatic however, he has a history of being willing to work with the government as the circumstances demand, though is determined to hold onto his principles.\n\nThe others are rarely as stubborn. While perhaps united in a common desire for a constitutionalist, civilian ruled future, their unwillingness (or inability) to organise at a higher level has limited their options. Indeed, for a given issue they rarely vote as a united bloc, with legislators either swayed or bribed or threatened into a side. Nevertheless, they are still a potent establishment force and provide hope for a constitutionalist, civilian ruled future. Their dreams of democratic reforms however are bound to be tempered by the realities they find themselves in.§!\n"

 SHX_recovery_party: "RP"
 SHX_recovery_party_long: "Recovery Party (Fuxing Dang)\n§LThe \"Recovery Party\" was formed out of the remnants of the former Anhui Clique (then rebranded as the Recovery League), the Communications Clique, the Prosperity League, and various smaller economic interest groups. Led by Liang Shiyi, most have served in the Fengtian government, though have quickly distanced themselves from Zhang's treacherous legacy. Representing the nation's fiscal and industrial interests, they are a prominent secondary force in politics especially in their old Manchurian power bases. Ceaseless infighting between old rivals and other petty disputes, however, mean that this uneasy alliance has struggled to build any cohesive political agenda, instead focusing on achieving common objectives related to national reconstruction.§!\n"

 SHX_democratic_constitutionalist_party: "DCP"
 SHX_democratic_constitutionalist_party_long: "Democratic Constitutionalist Party (Minzhu Xianzheng Dang)\n§LThe \"Democratic Constitutionalist Party\" include many of the \"elder generation\" of Chinese reformers, tracing their heritage to late Great Qing reformers like Liang Qichao and also the Progressive Party, a union of anti-Kuomintang politicians. Sidelined in the Beiyang government and totally breaking with Yuan Shikai after his monarchist ambitions, they evolved into the Chinese Constitutionalist Party, with a great emphasis on preserving Chinese constitutionalism in its fledgling republic and later constitutional monarchy. Loosely in their orbit are the Rural Reconstruction Association led by Yan Yangchu, another admirer of Liang Qichao.\n\nAfter the re-establishment of the Republic, the rogue young guard led by Wu Xianzi and Li Daming pushed for the creation of the Democratic Constitutionalist Party, to further emphasise their democratic ambitions. Many of the old guard like Xu Qin decided to retire in face of changing circumstances though that has not dampened their dreams of peacefully reforming the republic.§!\n"

 SHX_feng_unification_party: "NRP"
 SHX_feng_unification_party_long: "National Revolutionary Party (Guomin Geming Dang)\n§LThe National Revolutionary Party is the heir to Feng Yuxiang's Guominjun, once a military force for the revolution and salvation of China and now has become a fully functional political organ under the guise of Chinese nationalism. The party runs on the Guominjun platform of a Christian-methodist inspired morality along with quasi-socialist reforms while also subscribing to the beliefs of Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, to create a hybrid nationalistic and vaguely socialist revolutionary China. Led by President Feng, the Party runs on the platform of ensuring democracy - although how committed to that notion remains unforeseen in the near future.§!\n"
 SHX_feng_unification_party_bad_long: "National Revolutionary Party (Guomin Geming Dang)\n§LThe National Revolutionary Party is the heir to Feng Yuxiang's Guominjun, once a military force for the revolution and salvation of China and now has become a fully functional political organ under the guise of Chinese nationalism. The National Revolutionary Party finds most of its members as coming from former warlord cliques, perhaps merely as a way to reassert their former legitimacy and authority. Many of the more democratic factions in the National Assembly have denounced them however as merely a party of warlordism.§!\n"

 #辛亥俱樂部
 SHX_yan_unification_party: "Xinhai Club"
 SHX_yan_unification_party_long: "Xinhai Club (Xinhai julebu)\n§LAs Yan Xishan's storied career took him to new heights, the old Yan Clique rapidly swelled in followers. Yan has brought much of his old camarilla with him from Taiyuan to the Presidential Palace, though has also added a few more select figures to his inner circle. As a ruler however, Yan has sought to present himself as an independent, refraining from joining any formal party and ostensibly governing with impartial stewardship.\n\nSome of his more enterprising supporters have tried to build a more institutional support base by reviving the so-called \"Xinhai Club\", one of several evanescent groups formed in the aftermath of the 1911 revolution. Yan was said to be tangentially related to the faction, and in any case its leaders have mostly since died or gone their own way.\n\nThis has given some name and form to the growing number politicians, bureaucrats, and officers directly loyal to Yan himself, however direct or public support by the President for this endeavour has been shaky. The President seems content to keep up his non-partisan image, mingling with existing parties as necessary.§!\n"

 SHX_assorted_warlords: "Regionalists"
 SHX_assorted_warlords_long: "Assorted Regionalists, Warlords and Strongmen\n§LNot all of the warlords and military strongmen were vanquished in the ensuing wars of Chinese unification and the War of Resistance against Japan. Across the country, there still remain assorted regionalists and strongmen who have managed to worm their way into the new government, feigning loyalty to the national cause but really just using its authority to bully and exploit the people. Only time will tell whether or not these forces will be truly subdued.§!\n"

 SHX_young_china_party: "YCP"
 SHX_young_china_party_long: "Young China Party (Zhongguo Qingniandang)\n§LInspired by Liang Qichao and the Young Turks in the Ottoman Empire, the Young China Party (founded by Zeng Qi) adheres to a notion of a highly centralised China - one led by a party-state until an era of tutelage is completed. While once relatively \"moderate\", the party is seen an increasing stream of radicalism as many within the Party see the new Republic as in danger of falling behind the rest of the world. As such they follow an ideology of Han chauvinism and an anti-imperialist rhetoric characterised by a penchant for a cult of personality to be formed around the country's leader and their promotion of the idea of mass indoctrination. They also demand the rapid industrialisation of the Chinese nation to restore China's rightful place as a great power!§!\n"

 SHX_feng_yuxiang_intro_paragraph: "How does the son of a poor soldier go on to become a great man? In the old days, it was said that such a great man would not talk about his lowly birth, but in the ailing days of the Great Qing, history was written by many sons of the \"laobaixing\". The grandson of a peasant and the son of a former bricklayer, servant and labourer turned soldier, Feng Yuxiang spent his childhood raised by impoverished opium addicts. Born Feng Jishan, at age ten his life changed when his father's friends, placed him on the soldiers' roster in order to double his family's payroll. Apparently by error, his name was recorded for the first time as \"Yuxiang\"."
 SHX_feng_yuxiang_mid_paragraph: "Over the next few years, his mother died and he continued growing up in a military camp - turning into an effective soldier of a dying empire. Several attempts at gambling and becoming penniless helped Feng develop a lasting resolve - to never gamble or drink again and to save his limited money. An eager soldier in a corrupt military, he quickly became disgusted by the rampant corruption, incompetence and foreign domination of the humiliated nation. It was no surprise then, that this soldier once deemed a \"foreign snack\" (that is, one destined to be killed by enemy invaders), turned to revolution.\n\nAs the units around him developed into the Beiyang Army under Yuan Shikai, Feng became a Christian and increasingly dissatisfied. In the chaos of the 1920s, Feng stood out as a travelling commander/governor known for his strict religious discipline for himself and his growing command. Dubbed the \"Christian General\" in 1919, his service with the Zhili clique came to an end with his participation in the failed 1924 Beijing coup. In its aftermath, Feng fled northwest with his army, now known as the Guominjun."

Joining the wave of revolutionary and anti-imperialistic sentiment, Feng rose through the ranks in wake of the Xinhai revolution, becoming a member of the Beiyang Army and later the Zhili clique.\n\nHaving converted to Christianity and utilising its tenets as a means of aggressively enforcing a more virtuous social order amidst the chaos of the Warlord Era. Feng became known as the \"Christian General\" across his various campaigns and assignments in the 1910s-1920s. His followers, initially the 16th Mixed Brigade and later the 11th Division, became famous for their strict discipline and ideological fanaticism.\n\nBombastic, revolutionary, and often the centre of attention, Feng soon gained another nickname - \"the traitor general\". A key plotter along with Sun Yue and Hu Jingyi in the 1924 Beijing Coup, its initial success propelled Feng to great fame and also allowed him to meet Sun Yat-sen. However, it soon collapsed and Feng's allies were forced to flee northwest, becoming known as the \"Northwest Army\" or perhaps more famously the \"Guominjun\" (National Army).\n\nSubsequent schemes to return to power in Northern China ultimately came to nought, though the Guominjun remain steadfastly loyal to Marshal Feng. The centre of a large cult of personality and known for his flamboyant, revolutionary spirit, Feng dreams of one day having a chance to bring about his vision for a renewed China.§!\n\n§YNotes: The undisputed leader of the Guominjun, there is little doubt where his loyalties lie.§!"

 SHX_yan_xishan_starting_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LOctober 8th, 1883, in Xinzhou, Shanxi Province, Great Qing§!\n§YBackground:§! §LGovernor Yan Xishan is a larger-than-life figure in many ways - the son of a wealthy family that lost it all, a soldier turned revolutionary, a native son of Shanxi who drove out the haughty Manchu mandarins, a Model Governor of his beloved province. Some say he simply does not live up to this reputation in life, with an increasingly divided and stagnant government, endemic corruption leading all the way to the top, and a failed national contender during the struggle for northern China in the 1920s. Whatever the case, as Shanxi reels from the impacts of the shifting political tides, Governor Yan is forced to work with (and against) his erstwhile allies in the Guominjun, led by Feng Yuxiang. Despite all the troubles he faces, and despite all the odds, Yan still believes a day will come when he will save China from its disunity and bring about the stabilising, guiding hand that it so desperately needs.\n\nYan Xishan was born to one of Shanxi's once numerous banking and commercial clans and given a traditional Confucian education expected of his status. This, combined with his family's loss of status following a major economic downturn, perhaps explains his uneasy, fractious alliance/relationship with the gentry. After enrolling in Taiyuan military school, he went abroad to study in Japan for a few years. This experience was eye-opening for him as he saw a society that had rapidly modernised under an authoritarian, centralised government. He further admired the discipline and \"Bushido\" code of the Japanese military, and praised their success in defeating Russia in the Russo-Japanese war. The German Empire's victory in the Weltkrieg further turned him down the route of autocracy, reinforcing his belief in the need for strong leadership. Governor Yan took up leadership of Shanxi after the Xinhai revolution of 1911, though he cut ties with Sun Yat-sen after 1913. Despite his desire for Chinese unity, he remained suspicious of successive central governments' attempts to undermine his control of the province. He achieved fame for his many modernising programmes for Shanxi, though more cynical observers note that quite a few have failed to come to meaningful fruition.§!"

As Shanxi's once prosperous banking community withered, the young man enrolled (like many others to come) in military schooling at Taiyuan in hopes of securing a stable living for the future. In 1904 he went to Tokyo for further military schooling, greatly inspired by the rapid progress, authoritarianism, and militarism he saw while abroad. He further met Sun Yat-sen and joined the Tongmenghui, preparing a \"Blood and Iron\" society and later joining a \"Dare to Die\" corps with other Chinese revolutionaries. Returning home, he became a commander in Shanxi, which allowed him to help overthrow local Qing loyalists during the 1911 revolution.\n\nHis military and organisational skills allowed him to become the military governor of Shanxi, with de facto supremacy over the civilian governor. He survived multiple attempts to bring Shanxi under the heel of the central government, first by Yuan Shikai and then by Wu Peifu. While he demands his commanders utilise the latest in military technology and tactics, as a field commander he has a tendency to insist on holding every piece of land and micromanaging campaigns far from the front. Given his failures to push against Zhili forces during the Fourth Zhili-Fengtian War and his numerous duties in administration, many question if it is wise for Yan to take up field command. On the other hand, others point out that surely with the wisdom and cunning the \"Model Governor\" has shown, it is only natural that Yan takes charge.§!\n\n§YNotes: The core of the so-named \"Yan Clique\", the Governor commands tremendous influence throughout Shanxi.§!"

At age 18, shortly after enrolling in Taiyuan Civilian Middle School, he was inspired by many activists from Beijing who taught him about Sun Yat-sen and his Three Principles of the People. Together, he and other students formed the Jiaocheng County branch of the Kuomintang in 1925. Within a year, he ran away from home to attend Whampoa academy. As the Northern Expedition raged, he secretly returned home to Shanxi to organise his comrades in preparation for the eventual KMT takeover. That takeover never came - at least not in 1927. Instead, Jiacai went underground with his closest associates - forming a secretive intelligence cell based in Jiaocheng. An associate of the BIS and rumoured to be the long-time head of the entire North China branch, the Kuomintang's recent resurgence has seen Qiao installed as the Governor of Shanxi.

Pan Zili was one of these youths, joining an artillery battalion as a trainee in 1921 at age 17. Two years later, he became a socialist, inspired by Wei Yechou and news in 1925 about the leaked Entente's treacherous intentions to hand over Shandong to Japan had they won the Weltkrieg. After helping organise protests in Taiyuan, he was chased out of Shanxi by provincial authorities despite the protests petering out relatively quickly - a testament to Yan's brutality. He fled to France in 1925 to study at the Sun Yat-sen University in Paris, spending his time in exile developing his revolutionary thoughts. He returned home in 1933 to organise labour unionism in Taiyuan, most concentrated in the Taiyuan Municipal Labour Union. Once a fringe leader, even within the broader Shanxi left and even within the Taiyuan Labour Union itself, the rising socialist tide in China has seen Pan Zili installed as the Governor of Shanxi. Working with other leftist groups in China, Pan Zili and his Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Syndicalist Youth League intend to promote a truly new order for China's most oppressed province.§!"

Failure in the revolutionary evidently did not stop Wei's efforts and he continued to organise underground KMT elements while embedding himself within the Guominjun.

#Industrial Concerns
 SHX_shanxi_university_concern: "Shanxi University"
 SHX_shanxi_university_concern_desc: "Shanxi University is a relatively new institution, founded in 1902 as Shanxi Imperial University. Staffed initially in no small part thanks to foreign missionaries, the campus and faculty have grown considerably more diverse - sometimes to its own detriment as scholars trained in different countries and infused with different ideologies get into public fights. The University has recently received renewed patronage from the provincial government, a fact that has lifted the college out of a previous rut. The school is relatively modern, housing a law school and medical school on top of an engineering school, a language school, and a more traditional literature school. Nearby is also the Normal School, which serves to educate future teachers. Classes offered in the university are diverse, especially with the recent shift away from teaching the humanities towards that of sciences and engineering. Although far from the glamour of their Beijing peers, the university is the jewel of Shanxi's fledgling education system."

 SHX_economic_reconstruction_committee: "Economic Reconstruction Committees"
 SHX_economic_reconstruction_committee_desc: "Economic Reconstruction Committees have been established all across the province, owing to the common belief among Shanxi's higher echelons that previous failures of Shanxi were due to poor institutional planning. These committees are led by the local elite, who have been charged with drafting and implementing a reconstruction plan for their villages each year. District Reconstruction Committees then integrate the various village-level plans, incorporating the input of trained technocrats. Finally, a Central Reconstruction Committee headquartered in the capital formulates a provincial-level agenda. This bottom-up system of integrated planning in theory is a very modern, almost avant-garde way of conducting central planning. Though, of course, the devil is always in the details. And there are plenty of details to be examined."

 SHX_pekin_syndicate_concern: "Pekin Syndicate (Ostchina-Direktorium)"
 SHX_pekin_syndicate_concern_desc: "Early attempts by the Anglo-Chinese run \"Pekin Syndicate\" to exploit resources in Shanxi frequently ran afoul of xenophobic and anti-concessionist agitation by Shanxi's students. After the collapse of British colonial authority, the investors and businessmen of the Pekin Syndicate no longer had a significant force backing them against Chinese interests. The Ostchina Direktorium of the AOG would swoop in and buy controlling shares in the company, giving it the stability and large backer it needed to remain competitive. Under the auspices of the Chung Fu Mining Administration, a collaboration between the Pekin Syndicate and the Ostchina Direktorium, these foreign companies have worked to entrench themselves in the Shanxi mining industry, exploiting any openings they can in Shanxi's previously heavily controlled economy. It has since expanded its operations, inviting other (primarily German) major corporations willing to take risks under its umbrella.\n\nWerner Jannings of Siemssen & Co has emerged as the de facto leader of this powerful interest group, and has used his army of lobbyists and copious amounts of easy money to worm his way into Yan's inner circle. To mollify the suspicions of anti-concessionists, a token amount of Chinese investors have been allowed to join the remnant British shareholders in the AOG's north Chinese arm."
 SHX_northwest_industrial_company_concern: "Northwestern Industrial Company"
 SHX_northwest_industrial_company_concern_desc: "The Northwestern Industrial Company (Xibei Shi-ye Gong-si) is a state-controlled development corporation established with the intention of transitioning from State Capitalism to State Socialism, having the stated aim of developing heavy industry in Shanxi. Established in 1932 and with over 20 million dollars invested in it over the next five years, this conglomerate has absorbed nearly 40% of the capital taken from wealthy landlords via forced loans and forced energy plants to nearly double their kilowatt hours to service it. Controlling machine tool works, locomotives, and other plants, this project represents the titanic investments Shanxi has made to transform the impoverished, backwater region. Recently revitalised by yet another major industrial push, government favouritism has made it the cornerstone of the province's industrial programme."
 SHX_taiyuan_electric_light_concern: "Taiyuan Electric Light Company"
 SHX_taiyuan_electric_light_concern_desc: "The Taiyuan Electric Light company was frequently on poor footing, forced to file for bankruptcy in 1923 due to extensive corruption and poor management. Over the next decade and a half, many of the machines have law dormant and the faculties empty - despite promises by the Pekin Syndicate and later their Ostchina-Direktorium benefactors to bail it out. Never quite liquidated, the leadership of Shanxi have elected to keep operations running at a loss with state investment, hoping to preserve some semblance of stability."
 SHX_tung_chi_mining_concern: "Tung Chi Mining Company"
 SHX_tung_chi_mining_concern_desc: "Ever since a collection of Japanese investors, led by the illusive Komoto Daisaku, have set up camp near the border with Datong, their influence appears to be steadily growing. They have impressed some of our province's leadership with their adept handling of previously unprofitable mining operations, generating some of the most efficient and productive mines in the province. There are some who have called for an expanded partnership, with many members of both Yan and Feng's clique admiring Japan's economic prowess. Still, perhaps there is more than what meets the eye with this corporation, and with high levels of xenophobia still present in Shanxi perhaps we should leave this well enough alone."
 SHX_share_the_wealth_mining_concern: "Share the Wealth Mining Company"
 SHX_share_the_wealth_mining_concern_desc: "Over the years and under the fluctuating jurisdiction of the Shanxi Bureau of Public Mines, Yan's government (and often, his personal pocketbook as well) has acquired increasingly large stakes in many ostensibly private mining ventures in Shanxi province. One of these has attracted some renewed attention with recent developments in Shanxi, namely the Share-the-Wealth (Tung-Bao) Mining company, which historically sought to exploit the large coal deposits in the northern and eastern parts of the province. The de facto loss of East Shanxi to the Zhili, severe disruption caused by the Fengtian-Zhili wars, and extensive corruption caused by exorbitant salaries given to Yan's lackeys prevented meaningful modernisation in the 1920s. Now, however, with expanded operations, many hope the reorganised Share the Wealth company will truly allow for the people of Shanxi to benefit from the province's extensive mineral wealth."

 SHX_experimental_school_concern: "Experimental School for Village Education"
 SHX_experimental_school_concern_desc: "As part of the earlier phase of the Ten Year Plan, Shanxi built an \"Experimental School for Village Education\", with a board personally headed by Yan Xishan, Feng Yuxiang and Zhao Daiwen. Internally very successful since 1933, the school attracted a student body of diverse financial backgrounds and gave its classes a humble but advanced agricultural training. Its very idealistic goal of breaking class prejudices, modernising agricultural education and combining theoretical education with practical field training was extremely ambitious. It has been widely advertised throughout the province and outside of it as a sign of the progressiveness of Shanxi's rulers, with one claiming that \"they will revolutionise the countryside by acting as spearheads for the organisation of the masses - as a basic cadre for the implementation of economic reconstruction at a village level\". Embracing this school as a pinnacle of achievement in the Ten Year Plan would elevate its prestige to new heights, but whether or not it truly lives up to its name (and is more than just another propaganda showpiece) will have to be seen in the coming years."

 SHX_shaanxi_yanchang_petroleum_concern: "Yanchang Petroleum Corporation"
 SHX_shaanxi_yanchang_petroleum_concern_desc: "Plans to extract oil from Shaanxi were first developed in 1903 by Shaanxi native Yu Yanbiao, retired German admiral Constantin von Hanneken, and Yanchang county magistrate Zheng Mingde though this plan was blocked by the Qing government. After a delay, the Shaanxi government raised funds to establish a state-run Yanchang Petroleum Company which later received Qing approval in 1905 as the Yanyan Petroleum Corporation. With a concerted effort by Shaanxi officials and the aid of foreign experts like Shojiro Abe, China's first inland oil refinery was established.\n\nJapanese aid, investment, and technicians continued to stream into Shaanxi, as Yanchang became known for its quality petroleum and chemical products. Drilling ran into some problems however in 1934 as Guominjun overexploitation hastened the drying up of oil reserves. A new effort would have to be made if we are to restore output."

#Material Concerns
 SHX_taiyuan_arsenal: "Taiyuan Arsenal"
 SHX_taiyuan_arsenal_desc: "Taiyuan Arsenal, built in 1923 under the orders of Yan Xishan, is a vital arms manufacturing hub in China - and a critical piece of leverage keeping Shanxi autonomous. Building a range of weapons including handguns, rifles, artillery, grenades, and ammunition, Shanxi's vast foundries employ thousands of workers. Capable of producing western equipment (or at least close replicas), the quality of equipment churned out in Taiyuan Arsenal is largely unmatched by others in China. The Shanxi clique's hold over this arsenal gives them hope that they will one day be capable of matching their better-funded foes on the battlefield."

 SHX_shanxi_automobile_company_concern: "Northwest Automobile Transportation Company"
 SHX_shanxi_automobile_company_concern_desc: "The proud product of the Ten Year Plan's State Capitalist agenda, the Northwest Automobile Transportation Company is a government-backed enterprise that receives extensive funding from the provincial government. Sharing a name with and serving as a spiritual successor of an earlier project established by Feng Yuxiang, this modern iteration contrasts with its predecessor in that rather than seek foreign suppliers, it focuses on domestic production. Churning out an impressive catalogue of cars, trucks, and other motor vehicles, the powers that be hope to fill Shanxi's recently renovated roads with new cars driven by middle-class Chinese rather than wealthy foreigners. While the quality is somewhat suspect despite what state propaganda claims, it does appear to be gaining some traction and making sales (albeit primarily in-province rather than for export). Long term, the administration hopes to repeat the successes of similar state projects such as sulphates, iron works, and machine tool factories - not particularly efficacious on their own but helping build a trained industrial workforce for the future. With any luck, one day Shanxi will have a thriving automobile industry of its own."

#Aircraft Concerns
 SHX_aircraft_design_board: "Taiyuan Aircraft Design Board"
 SHX_aircraft_design_board_desc: "A joint cooperation between the Taiyuan Arsenal Arms Committee, the research department of the Military Technical School, and foreign hired advisors, the Governor's initiative to build a native Shanxi airforce has taken a new direction with the province's ambition to produce native-designed aircraft. Facilitated by a recent effort that successfully created an aircraft factory, this new design board reflects Shanxi's soaring ambitions as they hope to reach new heights."

#Armour Concerns
 SHX_arsenal_arms_committee: "Taiyuan Arsenal Arms Committee"
 SHX_arsenal_arms_committee_desc: "Taiyuan Arsenal does not merely build firearms and artillery from designs stolen or purchased abroad. It also boasts an innovative, clever team of designers and engineers constantly tweaking and improving upon various plans. Offering large bonuses to anyone (not just regular employees) capable of designing or improving weapons for Taiyuan's use, German and German-trained technicians in Taiyuan Arsenal have managed to convince the committee to allocate significant funds for armoured vehicle designs. This ambitious endeavour by Shanxi's engineers has raised high expectations, though whether or not Shanxi's industrial base can actually produce the designs made in significant numbers remains up for question."

 #SHX Introduction Events

 SHX_KR_gathering_storm_desc: "Yan Xishan's Jin clique has retained a policy of guarded neutrality, while Feng Yuxiang's Guominjun are infamous for their zealous opportunism. The end of northern China's power struggles spelled bitter defeat for both regardless, forcing them into an uneasy alliance.\n\nThis \"Shanxi Clique\" consists of two ambitious strongmen and an impoverished province hardly able to support even one grandiose vision. Although they do not know it yet, new opportunities are arising. Who will get a second chance at glory and who will be relegated to a historical footnote will soon be determined..."

 #shanxi_events.0 and shanxi_events.1 have been converted into intro headers
 SHX_country_intro_background: "GFX_SHX_intro"
 SHX_country_intro_header: "The Shanxi Clique"
 SHX_country_intro_content: "Shanxi is a proud province with an ancient and illustrious history, said to be where Yu the Great released the waters of the Yellow River in ages past. This mountainous and isolated province has been ruled by various Chinese dynasties since antiquity, and has since come under the power of the Shanxi (or Jin) clique. Despite its name, the clique only governs the western part of Shanxi as well as parts of the neighbouring Shaanxi province. Its leader is the wily and venerable governor §PYan Xishan§!, who has ruled the province since the Xinhai revolution in 1911. His ambitious projects seeking to modernise the province have earned him some admiration and the moniker \"the Model Governor\".\n\nOnce a contender in China's fractious power games in the north, Yan backed §PYuan Shikai§! and later §PDuan Qirui§! in their efforts to stabilise their rule in the deteriorating Chinese political landscape. However, the ultimate victory of §cWu Peifu§!, §aCao Kun§! and the §PZhili clique§! atop the embers of the dying \"Beiyang\" Republic in 1928 saw §PZhang Zuolin§! forced back into Manchuria and §aFeng Yuxiang§! retreat with the §aGuominjun§! into Yan's protection. The former enemies were forced to present a united front against the growing power of the Zhili, and accepted the nominal restoration of the §cQing monarchy§! in exchange for Beijing's recognition of Yan as governor. Reeling from their disastrous participation in the Northern Expedition and the Fourth Zhili-Fengtian war, the two strongmen in Shanxi swore they would regroup and get their revenge."

 SHX_country_intro_header_1: "The Jin-Guominjun Alliance"
 SHX_country_intro_content_1: "§PGovernor Yan§! is not the only power in Shanxi. After deciding to cast their lot with the Kuomintang in 1926, Marshal §aFeng Yuxiang's Guominjun§! retreated into Shaanxi the following year - badly bloodied and with their organisation in tatters. Yan's defeat shortly afterwards forced the two men to come to an arrangement, and when §PWu Peifu§! sought to stamp out the GMJ once and for all, Yan publicly declared that should Feng be forced to leave China \"together we will see the world, hand in hand\". It is said that Feng in turn declared Yan was his sworn brother, solidifying the alliance.\n\nSince then their relationship has been largely symbiotic, with both larger-than-life figures promoting a seemingly complementary vision of progress. Yan's recognition by the central government in Beijing has kept the province legally protected, and his decades of deep ties with the local gentry have helped stabilise the province. Feng, a widely travelled soldier, has cultivated positive ties with the commoners and his zealous, experienced army helps guard the province's mountain passes.\n\nCombined, §PYan's Jin clique§! and §aFeng's Guominjun§! are generally referred to as the Shanxi clique, an autonomous western bastion ostensibly within the restored §cGreat Qing§!. This diarchy has been successful for nearly a decade in keeping the §PZhili§! at bay, a major triumph in an unforgiving political environment."

 SHX_country_intro_header_2: "Two Ambitions, One Province"
 SHX_country_intro_content_2: "However, both men compete for the spotlight, both internally and abroad, and beneath the surface lie two rather different visions for saving China. §PYan§! believes China needs a strong, paternal figure to lift it from poverty and longs for a stable society built around Confucian, albeit not necessarily traditionalist line. §aFeng's§! beliefs are more revolutionary, calling for a radical change in the nation for the sake of the people. Unfortunately, as the years have gone by, neither of their visions has grown any closer to being realised.\n\nNearly a decade later, things have not panned out the way they had hoped. Despite Yan's flattering nickname and Feng's idealistic rhetoric, the territory of the Shanxi clique is littered with half-finished or outright failed projects. Their §YTen Year plan§! to revitalise Shanxi lies largely stalled, and the province remains largely an economic backwater. Going into 1936, the same old problems of corruption, poverty and neglect will likely plague the land for at least one more year. Neither man can afford to sit idle amid a changing China, and in the end something must give. A palpable tension lingers in the background, even as both men insist their alliance is going strong. Still, despite all that has gone wrong, a familiar attitude remains: Shanxi Over All!"

 shanxi_events.2.t: "AOG Announces Expansion in the League"
 shanxi_events.2.d: "As Sun Chuanfang and his cronies celebrate the successful opening of new railways built by the AOG, Yan Xishan and his cabinet continue to haggle over details with the Germans. For the longest time, the Zheng Dai railroad has held an effective monopoly over Shanxi's railway connections to the South, charging exorbitant rates on freight. Governor Yan has been unwilling to shoulder the costs of laying new track and has asked the central government to help pay for additional railways. Wang Xiang, representatives from Beijing, and members of the Pekin Syndicate (backed by the Ostchina-Direktorium) have worked out an arrangement to this effect at last, however with the critical condition that the new track use standard width rather than the narrow gauge Yan has specified. It appears that negotiations have reached an impasse, and Yan (with the eager approval of Marshal Feng) will soon walk out of negotiations.\n\nThe collapse of yet another round of these negotiations highlights the economic isolation of Shanxi since the start of the century. Shanxi was once home to several of China's banking and commerce centres, known as the Piaohao (literally speaking, Draft Banks). The once fabulous wealth of the province has since evaporated, and the collapse of Chinese domestic stability has seen nearly 9 out of every 10 families in Shanxi fall into poverty. It is not just the mountains that prevent meaningful economic growth, as domestic paranoia and mistrust between Taiyuan and the central government strangle the economy of one of eastern China's poorest provinces. Yet, Governor Yan remains confident in his abilities, sure that his decision protects Shanxi from undue central government influence."

 shanxi_events.3.t: "Feng Suggests Larger Funding for the Guominjun"
 shanxi_events.3.d: "Pleased by Yan's decision to maintain Shanxi's autonomy from Beijing, Feng has offered to host Yan for their next meeting. The topic is one familiar to both men, though not necessarily for the better: military spending. A strong force is essential to the defence of the province, and has kept Wu Peifu at bay despite his victory in the north eight years ago. However, for a poor province such as Shanxi, supplying an army - much less two - is a heavy burden on an already strained economy. Indeed, for all their talk about the strength of the Yan-Feng alliance, both men have elected to maintain their own separate armies loyal to them, the Shanxi provincial army and the Guominjun (Nationalist Army) respectively.\n\nTo save on costs, both armies have cut down on their size since 1930. Yan and Feng champion the notion that the army should serve and be among the people - helping in public works projects and sometimes tending farms. While idealistic in theory, in practice many soldiers resent being treated as glorified coolies, and the quality of their armies has suffered for the last six years. The lack of unity between Shanxi's armies has contributed to inefficiency, and though both Yan and Feng have noted this, they have refused to give ground on which army should take the lead. Still, with little additional funds and no change in the political situation in sight, both are expected to graciously table the discussion for now and focus on other matters in Shanxi."

 shanxi_events.3.b: "I would like to know more about our armies."

 shanxi_events.3001.t: "The Composition of Our Armies"
 shanxi_events.3001.d: "Of the two armies guarding Shanxi, the Provincial Army is closer to Taiyuan. The Shanxi Provincial Army is an outgrowth of Yan's earlier needs to protect the province from roving bandits and warlord armies. As one of the few armies in China composed exclusively of men from its own province, on paper it is a motivated force capable of protecting its soldiers' homes. Supplied with weapons from the modern Taiyuan arsenal and with locally trained officers recruited from the educated gentry, most would expect them to be a formidable force. However, in practice this army severely struggles to fight any spirited foe, especially outside of Shanxi proper. Like many armies in China, desertion is common and morale is low - many join the military for the sake of a stable job, pay and personal power, fleeing when their lives are at stake.\n\nThe Guominjun is a force slowly assembled by Feng Yuxiang over years of fighting and roaming across northern China. Spirited, disciplined, and populist at its core, the Guominjun draw from their ranks many men from outside of the borders of the Shanxi clique who have since settled down in Shaanxi. Feng and the Guominjun pride themselves on being the army of the \"Laobaixing\" (the peasants and the commoners). This republican, quasi-socialist, and experienced army boasts of its quality, though in practice their superiority to other militias and armies in China is debatable.\n\nTogether, it is up to these two forces to defend Shanxi from outside aggression - but whether they complement or detract from one another remains to be seen."
 shanxi_events.3001.a: "Our boys do us proud!"

 shanxi_events.4.t: "Black Monday Arrives!"
 shanxi_events.4.d: "Terrible news has washed over China from a world away, reaching even a province as isolated as ours! As the aftershocks of Black Monday spread, the Shanghai Stock Exchange has collapsed, as have other trading houses across the country, sending the Chinese economy spiralling. Although Shanxi's government has worked to cordon itself off from the rest of the Chinese economy, trade has been utterly pulverised in many sectors with ties to the coast. This has the unfortunate effect of crippling our exports and worsening what is already an impoverished province. Many fear a return to the bad times of Shanxi, where starvation was rampant and parents sold their children in an effort to feed themselves.\n\nAlready, anti-concessionist and anti-foreign protests have begun to emerge in Taiyuan as already struggling students, many of whom couldn't find a job even in the previous economy, begin to seek scapegoats. Fingers are being pointed as the Provincial Bank of Shanxi struggles to maintain the faith of the population and the business community. Although perhaps not as hard hit as many parts of the world, as far as the people of Shanxi are concerned the situation is, without a doubt, an utter disaster."
 shanxi_events.4.a: "This is not what we need right now!"

 shanxi_events.5.t: "Telegram to Beijing"
 shanxi_events.5.d: "As the days go on and the crisis embroiling the League continues to spiral out of control, a new era of violence dawns on China. Yan Xishan is no stranger to these politics - he has survived decades of warlord strife since the 1911 Revolution. If one is to survive, one must be pragmatic in their decision-making, there is little room for petty grudges or prior alliances. Flexibility is key.\n\nSo, with Wu Peifu's grip on China weakening, and the already overstretched central army forced to watch both the North and South, Beijing clearly could use a friend. But friendship requires commitment, and in this era of shifting loyalties, it doesn't come free. Shanxi, for all its efforts over the last few decades, can use a friend too: one with deep pockets and enough discretion to avoid encroaching on the province's fine-tuned system. Perhaps Shanxi's self-imposed isolation can, at last, come to an end, and a new partnership arranged with the authorities in the \"Central Government\".\n\nAs he completes the telegram, the gears turn inside the inscrutable mind of the Model Governor. War and chaos bring opportunity, and in these uncertain times, alignments shift rapidly. If his cards are played right, perhaps this is the first step to national unification. On his terms."
 shanxi_events.5.a: "We can only wait."

 shanxi_events.6.t: "Feng Leaves for Shaanxi"
 shanxi_events.6.d: "Outrage can scarcely even describe Feng Yuxiang's mood. As Yan propositions Beijing, he scorns his current dance partner. Despite Yan's disingenuous assurances that this is merely a ploy to gather resources for national liberation, for the Guominjun, accepting any aid from the corrupt Zhili and their Manchu puppets is a fundamental betrayal of the principles underwriting the alliance. Like Yan, Feng senses the opportunity that Sun Chuanfang's demise brings. But rather than merely supplanting the old order, he intends to utterly dismantle it. Personally insulted by not being consulted on the telegram and unconvinced by Yan's half-hearted excuses, Feng has walked out of Taiyuan with many of his associates.\n\nHe is expected to head to Yan'an in Shaanxi, where the Guominjun are based. Even before his arrival, the Guominjun have been agitating their beloved laobaixing, inciting them against the imperialist, capitalist exploitation of the last decade and the hanjian in China who enabled it. In many ways, outside observers have found the Guominjun withering across the 1930s, but if they had ever fallen asleep in their exile then they are certainly awake now.\n\nDespite rising tensions fueling doubt on whether the Jin-Guominjun alliance can be held together any longer, all know that in the face of continued Zhili dominance over the Central Plains, peace will remain. For now at least. But what is certain is that, for as long as the Guominjun remain in Shaanxi agitating the countryside, Feng is plotting. Just what is uncertain - a coup, a revolution, a rebellion? But it certainly is nothing good for Yan Xishan."
 shanxi_events.6.a: "He wouldn't dare..."

 shanxi_events.7.t: "The Death of Jing Yuexiu"
 shanxi_events.7.d: "As lines are being drawn in the province, disturbing reports of betrayal and lies have begun trickling in. Perhaps most shocking, however, is the recent death of General Jing Yuexiu from a gunshot wound, occurring while he was in his own home. The general was a native of Shaanxi and an early revolutionary commander in the Xinhai revolution. An ally of Yang Yucheng and later the Guominjun, his defence of Xi'an against Liu Zhenhua solidified his reputation among the high command. But his suspicion of socialist activists, trade unions, and peasant associations combined with a general disillusionment following the Northern Expedition has created a distance between him and the GMJ. Rumours had been swirling of a potential defection to Yan's side.\n\nThe police's preliminary investigation has concluded, and it appears his death was legitimately an accident. On the other hand, however, Jing was a major powerholder in Yulin and this influence in Northern Shaanxi meant he posed a significant threat to both Yan and Feng. A funeral will be held promptly, with many of his former subordinates attending a tense moment. The general consensus is that it was a..."

 shanxi_events.8.d: "Although there has been much said (and much to be said) about Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang, for all of their pretensions of grandeur they are merely the centre of a larger machine. The warlord does not govern simply through military force and extortion, but rather by building semi-legitimate authority through their ability to protect and provide for their people. Over the years, complicated networks develop including civilian bureaucrats, intellectuals, military men, the high society and the underground.\n\nAssisting the leaders in Shanxi are a collection of various advisors (official and less so) with profound influence. While many serve on the cabinet, this group does not consist of mere functionaries and technocrats: these men are distinguished by their ability to capture and represent key stakeholders in Shanxi's society, channelling their power into building ties with certain facets of the province. Naturally many jockey for influence for their pet projects, and some have already chosen sides in Shanxi's fractious politics.\n\nThese gentlemen are essential to the good functioning of Shanxi, and may provide us many benefits if they align with us. But we should also be warned that there are only so many we can favour at once. It is up to the Governor to choose his favourites wisely."

 shanxi_events.9.t: "Another Hard Year"
 shanxi_events.9.d: "For the third straight year, ever since 1934, droughts and floods have devastated the fields of Shanxi province. Combined with the disruption to commodity prices Black Monday has wrought, the pain is particularly felt in central and southern Shanxi. This has not only cut into provincial treasuries, it has also attracted considerable resentment by the downtrodden in Shanxi with tenant and small yeomen farmers alike resenting the continued tax burdens placed upon them to sustain the Ten Year Plan.\n\nExploiting this growing tension in Yan Xishan's heartland, Guominjun agents based in Shaanxi - often tied to the socialist underground - have moved in to organise farmers associations and other activist groups. Their convincing propaganda and semi-effectual attempts to encourage peasants to pool resources has eroded Yan's grip in his province. Even members of the gentry have begun to complain that the Shanxi provincial government is doing too little to help. With harvest season rapidly coming to a disappointing end, many desperate have sought debt relief to avoid foreclosure as well as the opening of government grain stores to ward off starvation."

 shanxi_events.11.t: "The Ten Year Plan Continues!"
 shanxi_events.11.d: "1930 was a major turning point for both Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang. Having been brought low and humiliated, and with their armies as demoralised as ever, both men were forced to do some heavy introspection. Wu Peifu's triumph despite significant odds and being surrounded on all sides could not simply be attributed to superior military skill or extensive German support - it was clear to the warlords of Shanxi that the Zhili's mastery of rail and communication technology as well as a developed industrial base was responsible for routing their forces on two separate occasions.\n\nNever again will they be allowed to make the same mistake. For the longest time, both Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang have - like the Confucian-trained Mandarins of old - prioritised agriculture and the farmer as the foundation of China. While both still value agriculture as a sector (Feng more so than Yan), it becomes clear that Shanxi will need a heavy industrial base of its own to compete with the likes of Beijing and Shenyang, both of which have received extensive foreign economic support. Yan, even more so than Feng has taken this to heart - demanding a wholesale investment into heavy industrial development that would stun even the totalists of Europe. The Shanxi government over the last several years have put in (with fluctuating levels of drive and success) significant political and economic capital into this project.\n\nThe collapse of Sun Chuanfang's administration has broken, at least for now, Wu Peifu's grip on China. However, it becomes clear that the fading Western influence on the status quo and nearly a decade of Beijing political entrenchment means that should Wu Peifu survive this or be replaced, Shanxi is unlikely to be able to return to its pre-1936 status quo. Therefore Shanxi must take the initiative to develop its economic base and consolidate its power in the North from the likes of the Zhili before it is too late.\n\nFurthermore, the Ten Year Plan has spurred significant competition between Yan and Feng as well as their allies, all using this massive, all-encompassing drive to consolidate their grip over the province and instil their own hold on the political, economic, and social spheres of Shanxi's citizens. No doubt that the successes and failures of this Ten Year Plan will determine the future of Shanxi, and possibly all of China."

 shanxi_events.11.c: "We will emerge triumphant! (Continue Playing)"

 shanxi_events.12.t: "Objectives of the Ten Year Plan"
 shanxi_events.12.d: "The primary two objectives of the Ten Year Plan are to industrialise Shanxi and reverse the trade deficit Shanxi experiences with the rest of China. The first is already partially complete, with decades of efforts to jump-start a domestic industry around Taiyuan mostly stuttering and stalling due to corruption and war. Despite these failures, the raw materials are there for an industrial revolution not unlike Britain - a recent population boom, large amounts of cheap and accessible coal, some degree of urbanisation, and just under a decade of political stability. The problem is just about everyone else has gotten to that point first, which leads to the second point: the trade deficit. Large amounts of capital flow out of Shanxi, primarily into the pockets of Beijing and German merchants. Products from outside such as kerosene, textiles, and tobacco products, flood into Shanxi outcompeting its domestic industries (despite heavy protections) and further accelerated due to global depression pushing advanced nations to export as much as possible. It has gotten to the point that even Shanxi's attempt at creating a domestic narcotics industry has been outcompeted by heroin and morphine made from outside the province!\n\nTo achieve these primary goals, three more immediate objectives have been outlined by Shanxi's economic planners: Educational Reforms, Agricultural Reforms, and Industrial/Commerical Reforms. Yan and Feng have separate visions for how to accomplish each of these aims, and further context and information will be provided as you go down these respective trees. Resources are extremely tight in Shanxi, even with heavy mobilisation across the board. So is time. Decisions will have to be made regarding how heavily to invest in each sector - but be warned that half-hearted efforts in the past have historically failed to materialise the necessary changes to the province."
 shanxi_events.12.a: "Remind me of the background of this plan."

 shanxi_events.13.t: "Mechanics of the Ten Year Plan"
 shanxi_events.13.d: "In terms of gameplay, the Ten Year plan provides the bulk of Shanxi's early-game domestic content (the other half being its domestic politics tree and the military tree). Each reform follows broadly a similar pattern - the first focus spawns a focus that will provide some background and allow you to choose between one of two directions for that objective. It will also begin a mission timer that will reflect Shanxi's progress towards completing their respective reforms. There are focuses peripheral to the \"main\" part of each branch, which offer some bonuses but more importantly offer decisions that allow you to accelerate the reform process usually at a cost. It is not strictly necessary to take these focuses, especially if you'd like to prioritise other key focuses, however, if you'd like to complete a reform faster they may be necessary to prepare Shanxi in time for war. Do note as well that upon completing the reform focus of each branch, many of the existing decisions to accelerate the reform timer will disappear.\n\nThis system also ties in heavily with the political content of this faction. Many of the focuses, decisions and events that will appear will also strengthen either Yan or Feng, contributing to their ultimate consolidation of power. The system is designed to allow for a player to relatively quickly consolidate power, though whether or not this is the correct course of action is for the player to decide. It might, however, be to your advantage to balance the two for a duration of time - as a simulated \"opposition\" will take a weakened form of the other side of each branch, giving some bonuses. Furthermore, after one side consolidates power you will not be allowed to start (though you will be allowed to finish) the branch opposite to its interests. Lastly, a stability malus will be applied for initiating the purge or allowing the revolution while the balance of power is not yet at the 95-100% range for the respective side.\n\nBeijing's influence is the final key element to this large-scale mini-game. Higher influence from Beijing taxes Shanxi's civilian factories but usually allows for powerful economic buffs. For players seeking to go to war relatively quickly, it would be advisable to avoid taking options that increase their influence, however, those seeking to prepare longer may find their bonuses useful. Given the uncertainties involved in the start of the Zhifeng war and how resource-strapped this faction is, careful timing is critical for success."

 shanxi_military_events.1.t: "Invite Foreign Advisors"
 shanxi_military_events.1.d: "It's no secret that the quality of Chinese armies has been highly underwhelming over the past century. With most soldiers tending to flee at their earliest convenience, the military forces of the Shanxi Clique find themselves slightly better but not much better than armies from other provinces.\n\nAs such, many of [SHX.GetLeader]'s advisors have proposed seeking foreign advisors to train and discipline the armed forces of Shanxi. Traditionally cut off from the sea and thus from foreign influence, the nature of anti-foreign sentiment in Shanxi is certainly prevalent but not prominent. Indeed while anti-imperialism does remain prevalent, there is certainly a willingness to learn and adopt the methods of fighting from the modern nations of the West and the East.\n\nWe have been approached by German advisors (who have helped train the Qing army and the League of Eight Provinces), Russian advisors, and Japanese advisors. While we look forward to their military aid and help, we must also be cautious of what potential consequences they might bring. Undoubtedly, seeking assistance from German advisors while granting us impressive military training may open our borders to more significant influence from Zhili province. Looking toward the Russian and Japanese advisors may inspire nationalists such as the Guominjun."

 shanxi_military_events.2.d: "The average soldier in China does not care much about his officers, his general, or his warlord. He merely cares for the pay and bread that comes with his military service, the prospect of bringing food and money to his family in his rural poverty-stricken home town. Ideas of nationalism, of defending the honour of the country are virtually unbeknownst to him.\n\nTo improve the quality of our troops, the military high command under [SHX.GetLeader] has decided to pursue the western model of implementing, political commissars within the rank - of officers who are instructed to guide the recruits' moral and political training and to intertwine the spheres of politics and the military.\n\nPromoting his own ideals of thought, the model proposed by Yan Xishan sees to it that the military is instructed by those from the Heart Washing Society. Officers are to familiarise themselves with their soldiers, know their men's backgrounds, and indoctrinate them with elements from Yan's peculiar twist on Confucianism and modernity.\n\nOn the other hand, the model proposed by Feng Yuxiang proposes that officers from Feng's Guominjun should lead the commissar model. Instead of promoting Yan's beliefs on virtue and order, they seek to instil a sense of nationalist patriotism amongst the recruits, to awaken the people of Shanxi to the salvation of their country from imperialism. Furthermore, the commissars from Feng's proposal will also instruct the people of Shanxi to act morally and justly towards the civilian population, with lessons taken straight from Christianity."

 shanxi_military_events.3.d: "Desperate to achieve victory in the coming wars against stronger powers, [SHX.GetLeader] has initiated an ambitious programme called \"Every Farmer a Soldier\". Private land ownership has been officially abolished and it is to be redistributed equally to every fit male peasant between the ages of eighteen to forty-eight. Working in groups of three, each was required to serve in the armies of [SHX.GetNameDef] for at least a few years while the other partners cultivate their land and that of the drafted one.\n\nAlthough advertised as a patriotic measure, in practice, this has severely restricted the rights of the peasantry. They have been prohibited from leaving their lots and have been subject to military discipline almost continuously. In addition to regular military training, taxes have greatly increased both on the peasants and existing landholders. The latter group have particularly protested, especially in light of prior taxes levied on them, with any land they could not personally farm being taken away by the state for a meagre payout."

Yet, nonetheless [SHX.GetLeader] has decided to stake his own claim on the skies, hoping to create not only a domestic aviation industry but also an Air Force of our own.\n\nPurchasing a small fleet of training aircraft and sending cadets to makeshift training facilities, these men are some of the province's earliest pioneers in military air force technology. There have been discussions about sending other cadets to training schools in [QIE.GetNameDef] or hiring outside mercenary trainers to help.

Korean by birth, An Chang-nam studied flying in Japan, but despite being a former flight instructor there - he resolved to fight against the Japanese imperialists after watching the massacre of Koreans after the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake. Having made his way across China, where he was received and offered a commission by Yan Xishan, An Chang-nam helped modernise the Shanxi Provincial Air Force and also participated in the War of Resistance against the Japanese. Now, with Korea finally liberated, there is no longer any need for him to stay in Shanxi. After a tearful ceremony, he bade his comrades and [SHX.GetLeader] farewell, before heading off with a few other Korean volunteers back to their homeland."

 shanxi_political_events.1.t: "To the Future of Shanxi"
 shanxi_political_events.1.d: "Governor Yan once put the situation quite frankly: \"the people don't care what happens to their government because their government never really cared what happened to them.\"\n\nIndeed, for all of the Yan Clique's talk of progress and the Guominjun's talk of revolution, for many of the laobaixing, life has changed very little over the last few decades. They still toil in the fields endlessly, with little prospect of personal advancement and little to show for all the sacrifices they have made for the two strongmen's grand visions. The bureaucracy is hopelessly corrupt in many parts of the province - even the few who are fortunate enough to be able to make an honest living on their meagre salaries find themselves serving a corrupt administration. Yan Xishan's efforts at cleaning up his government from within have taken a paternal tone, offering a vision of Confucian-inspired stability in a hybrid ideology built around his cult of personality. Democracy means little more than a tool to capture public enthusiasm, with the Japanese-educated Yan Xishan being deeply suspicious of any true political pluralism as the harbinger of anarchy. This suspicion is no doubt at least in part fuelled by the aggressive campaigning of the Guominjun, who promise a nationalist, populist revolution but regularly hold an authoritarian grip on the lands they do control - creating a dual power structure that threatens to destabilise the province.\n\nBetween the two men are thousands of undecided intellectuals, urban labourers, bureaucrats, merchants and the ever-present laobaixing, who navigate life in one of China's poorest provinces. Both men claim to be the only ones able to save Shanxi, and indeed all of China - if only the people would vest absolute power and faith in their respective causes. As these power struggles rage and families wrest with questions of ideology, war, revolution, progress and of course the all-power question of making ends meet, the winds of change begin to blow..."

 shanxi_political_events.2.t: "Growing Social Controls"
 shanxi_political_events.2.d: "The pressures of the Ten Year Plan and the animosity between Shanxi's strongmen have created an atmosphere of growing distrust and authoritarianism in the province. The Governor and his men are determined to stamp out the opposition in the province, combining increased economic control with political repression. Magistrates for the districts and their subordinates feel a number of eyes looking over their shoulders, and many have been called back to the capital for regular reports and retraining. Those deemed incompetent or insufficiently loyal have been dismissed. Headsmen of villages have been made salaried employees of the government - a \"gift\" few seem to appreciate as they receive a similar summons for \"retraining\".\n\nModelling his administrator after that of Japan and the socialist Union of Britain from afar, whispers emerge of a new secret police force known as the Peace Preservation Bureau. Over ten thousand have been recruited over the last few years, with village offices being established in recent weeks and an auxiliary Peace Preservation Corps being mobilised as well. These agents are expected to supplement the already large (if somewhat stagnant) police force led by Commissioner Nan Peilang, a longtime security head of the province. Leaked internal quotas suggest a goal of one policeman for every 25 families and the potential need for a \"reign of terror\" to keep people in line. This effort has rolled downhill, with the paramilitary Boy Scouts and the Young People's Groups both encouraging their members to practise \"reciprocal surveillance\". Although far from the police state that totalists and legionaries extol, Shanxi's progress has no doubt come at a cost."

 shanxi_political_events.3.d: "With anti-imperialist and anti-foreign sentiment at an all-time high in the political realm, it is no surprise that culture has begun turning that way as well. Anti-German sentiment in particular has been high ever since their intervention and regular abuses done by their Aufsichtsrat der Ostasiatischen Generalverwaltung, the hated AOG. A local drama group in southern Shanxi has put on a play called \"Dadao Hanjian\" (Down with the Traitor!), a one-act rhyming performance that has achieved much success as a propaganda tool. Performed in a local dialect, the author was no other than one of Shanxi's own Zhao Shuli.\n\nZhao was born to a poor Shanxi farming family, who was fortunate enough to attend a free normal school in Changzhi. Given an eclectic education from his grandfather, a member of the syncretic Three Sects Faith, he was also exposed to tales of the exploits of \"modern\" countries including stories of George Washington, the French Revolution, Industrialisation, Turgenev and Ibsen. Although not a socialist, he was imprisoned during the political paranoia the Northern Expedition brought to Taiyuan, and the guards browbeat confessions out of him and fellow prisoners. When he was unable to say anything about socialism, he was given socialist pamphlets to read to write his confessions by the guards. Finally released, and later forced to see his family abused by a landlord, Zhao has made a left-wing turn. The authorities have kept a careful eye on him and his compatriots, but his artistic depictions of rural life in Northern China have nonetheless won him acclaim (and protection) for now."

The fight against social evils is a common goal for all of China's reformers both revolutionary and conservative, despite their differences. In Shanxi, the rule of this modern, \"progressive\" government has sought to eliminate what they perceive as social ills such as prostitution and sexual deviance, idleness and sloppiness, and a range of other \"social crimes\" such as gambling, brawling, and the use of the old lunar calendar.\n\nAs a testament to the province's dedication to eliminating any sign of \"backwardness\", the Early Rising Society meets every morning to knock on doors around the province and report anyone still in bed after 6 am. Boy Scouts, officials, and civic groups have been called to monitor any miscreants, with school children being sent to offenders' homes to curse and yell at them until they come out and apologise. Others with behaviours deemed inappropriate by the state are hounded in the streets by crowds (including many children), with people shouting \"bad man won't you be good?\" The actual enthusiasm of these mobs vary, some merely come for the spectacle or seek to ward off having the crowds sic'd on them.

Feng and his Guominjun contributed significantly to the effort, forcing offenders to wear posters describing their crime while walking the streets to public ridicule. It is said the latter has employed multiple women to investigate gambling even within homes. And yet, the practice continues unabated.\n\nIt certainly does not help that many of the officials regularly indulge in it as well. Magistrates and their subordinates regularly play games well into the night and come morning are too tired to effectively manage their duties.

With his father's protection behind him and his friends, the police have little recourse but to drive them home and try their best to calm down any victims.\n\nThe Guominjun however, are unlikely to let this opportunity to embarrass their rival slide. Their propagandists have wasted little time spreading these stories as evidence of the Governor's corruption and his family's moral decay, and it appears that every time the tale is retold the number of victims killed and cars destroyed seems to increase.

Readily accessible to even the commoners of Shanxi, he makes his rounds across the province handing out gifts and loans to those that ask for them. To bridge the gap between the commoners and his distant administration, Yan frequently mingles among the farmers, shopkeepers, and craftsmen asking their opinions about even matters of state. His easygoing, unpretentious demeanour often wins over those that see him. This \"common touch\" has always been critical in helping Yan maintain control over his province, often outsmarting the arrogant outsider magistrates sent to control him and Shanxi.\n\nJealous of this popularity, Yan's rivals have begun to coalesce around a strongman of their own. Socialist agitators in Taiyuan have sought to portray Yan as a man out of date with the times, instead suggesting that Feng Yuxiang is the true hero the people need.

While it would be a mistake to call Shanxi a democracy, there is little doubt that Shanxi has made great strides in implementing a village-based peasant democracy in recent weeks. This is the culmination of a decades-long process, which began with Yan Xishan's effort at creating what he called a \"government that makes use of the people\", ordering that each village elect a headsman directly from the people and each village has a legislative assembly. However, these initiatives (allegedly modelled after the self-government created in the Zhou Dynasty) were not particularly effective in part because Yan sought to keep them as a rubber-stamping committee (often approving spending that occurred years prior) but also because many of the people serving were too preoccupied gambling and drinking. The Yan Xishan clique has kept most of these councils (perhaps rightly) on a tight leash, with magistrates frequently choosing headsmen in practice.\n\nThis has been changing however due to recent shifts in the political atmosphere. With renewed determination, the Rural Training Institutes originally established by Feng and Guominjun have worked hard to train local villagers in political literacy and to create village leadership not only made up of peasants but also well-run for the sake of the peasants.

As a result, multiple initiatives have been created or expanded upon, and reports have finally begun to trickle in that our efforts have been a success. There are just over one hundred districts in Shanxi, of which each needs a magistrate and each magistrate needs an administrative staff if the province is to run efficiently. Most districts have been broken up into three to six subdistricts run by a deputy magistrate. These magistrates have received training in Taiyuan's Training Academy and the Institute of Political Administration, and go on to serve under the newly formed Bureau of Villages. That being said, the curriculum had to be revamped and the number of students increased to meet the needs of the Ten Year Plan. Although some were sad to see many of the traditional cultural practices discarded such as the focus on calligraphy and poetry (a staple of the ideal scholar-official), their new training better fits the province's modern, technocratic needs.\n\nCorruption was unfortunately quite common, to the extent that for the longest time the administration had refused a merit-based system because it would result in too many firings. Many officials were only semi-literate, incompetent and lazy, and those that were not frequently utilised their skills to steal and extort. One of the first initiatives we put into place was eliminating the practice of Tax Farming (that is, outsourcing the collection of tax revenue to unscrupulous third parties to reduce overhead), and we have successfully eliminated at least the worst of the incompetents and thieves. There is plenty more to go, but at least the initial steps of our bureaucratic consolidation effort are complete."

 shanxi_political_events.10.d: "The state of nationalism in a nation divided by decades of warlordism is complicated. Few dare to question the idea that there is a single Chinese nation, but nationalism as an intellectual concept is relatively new, especially in relatively isolated regions such as Shanxi. There is an unfortunate tendency in [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to slander every supporter of the central government as being in the pocket of corporate interests or bowing to the boot of a corrupt dictatorship. This perception is reinforced by the lethargic state of the Harmony Association's regional branch, the most charitable interpretation being that the routine harassment of provincial authorities forces them to keep their activities discreet. However, there are plenty who align with Beijing for other reasons. For many nationalistic intellectuals, Chinese unity is paramount to other concerns and regionalism is to be condemned. Shanxi's government, for their part, have regularly utilised nationalism to their ends. Feng Yuxiang's Guominjun is named after the concept, and promotes a nationalistic, populist vision that condemns foreign imperialism and seeks to reverse the century of humiliation. Yan has also utilised nationalism for his ends, decrying imperialism and extorting China to maintain military readiness against foreign invasion. Shrines honouring Guan Yu and Yue Fei dot the countryside, and patriotism is lionised by Shanxi's authorities.\n\nOn the other hand however, Shanxi jealously guards its privileges. Distrust for the central government is rampant among the province's leadership, with most attempts at asserting national unity being undermined by fears of central government overreach. Regionalism, to many villagers, does not mean secessionism or even is seen as contradictory to the Chinese identity - while many disliked Governor Yan they were similarly steadfast against any outside replacement. After all, he is one of them - a local son.\n\nToday, as Shanxi navigates its place in the world, the people must come to a conclusion as to what they value more."

A global religion with many branches rooted around the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth, Christian missionaries have come to Shanxi to proselytise and also to provide humanitarian assistance in wake of the Warlord Era. These foreign missionaries often staff schools, reconstruction programmes and hospitals, and although the quality of these services varies greatly, it has won the gratitude of many in the province.\n\nFor Yan Xishan, religion is often a tool for controlling the public, at one point noting that \"a Heaven that cannot be found among men is too remote to be of any use\". He has at various points sought to discourage attendance at Christian schools and attempted to help establish an indigenous Christian church in Taiyuan. Despite this, however, he has built ties with Christian missionaries, seeking their advice and allowing Christians to speak at Heart Washing Society meetings (though forbidding any direct mention of their God). Of particular note are Oberlin College and the Chinese Inland Mission, which operate schools in the province.\n\nWithin the Guominjun camp, Feng Yuxiang is himself a Christian though adamantly insists one need not be a Christian to join his movement. The Guominjun frequently incorporates Christian principles in their teachings on vice and Feng's wife was a former Beijing YMCA organiser, though Feng and his movement refrain from alignment with any organised denomination. Indeed, in a more subtle way than Yan, Feng also views Christianity as a tool for moral order, by his own admission focusing on the practical implications of the faith rather than the theological aspects. He tends to have a lower opinion of foreign missionaries, particularly Catholics, accusing their churches of exploiting their protection to harbour criminals.\n\nFor many others far from either strongman, Christianity is a humble faith which they practise. One faith among a mosaic of others in Shanxi, it provides comfort in face of the coming storm in China."

Described by some as a philosophy, a way of life, and/or a religion, under Yan Xishan neo-Confucian thought is the cornerstone of his syncretic ideology. Feng Yuxiang for example, despite his Christian conversion, like many of his fellow Chinese takes Confucian principles for granted as the basis for his worldview, taking particular interest in caring for the laobaixing. To him, Christian and Confucian social principles differ little, and Christianity just happens to be more effective in their practices. Notably, while Buddhist and Daoist temples were ransacked by GMJ forces in the past, Confucian temples were always left undisturbed.\n\nYan, along with his chief ideologue Zhao Daiwen views the harmonious principles and calls for moderation embedded in Confucian thought as integral to solving the rampant social disorder and societal decay caused by the warlord era. The Heart Washing Society, seen by many as an attempt to revive the Confucian church, has received significant patronage from Yan during his tenure as governor.\n\nThat said, however, in many ways Yan has broken from his Confucian upbringing, even as he claims to be reviving it. In particular, his emphasis on the state and village over the needs of the family has drawn some ire, particularly as the Ten Year Plan progresses. Much of the authority traditionally bestowed on a Chinese father has been stripped away and the practice of arranged marriage has been suppressed as the youth have been encouraged to marry freely. At one point, the Governor has even proposed reburying the dead in village cemeteries so as to utilise plots of land previously used for family graveyards - an affront to Confucian tradition.\n\nHis open view of struggling against nature and attempt to subjugate the natural order similarly clashes with Confucian views of harmony, some of his followers going so far as to cast Confucius as a promoter of science and economic progress. Perhaps most tellingly, Yan's government has eliminated \"moral character\" as a criterion to enter the administration, believing technical competence on a large scale will do far more for the state than any Confucian-inspired morality."

 shanxi_political_events.13.t: "Buddha's Teachings in Shanxi"
 shanxi_political_events.13.d: "Buddhism is another major religion in Shanxi, a faith that emerges from the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama (the Buddha). Followers seek to overcome suffering through Buddhism's tenets, and the predominant denomination of the religion in China is a form of Mahayana Buddhism sometimes referred to as Han Buddhism. In the context of Shanxi's social climate, Buddhism's most prominent adherent within the government is Zhao Daiwen, one of Yan Xishan's chief lieutenants and mentors. Yan Xishan's experiences in Japan soured his outlook on Buddhism, seeing it as complacent and superstitious, and upon taking power in 1911 he initially attempted to destroy their temples and tear down their idols in favour of the Heart Washing Society. The public backlash was tremendous and Yan was forced to retreat, a testament to Buddhism's continued influence even in face of major political upheaval.\n\nFeng Yuxiang and the Guominjun saw a similar phase of anti-Buddhist activism. Feng's men have a history of looting Buddhist temples, converting others into schools for their own uses - to them Buddhism often represents a stagnant, \"old\" Chinese culture that failed them. To General Feng, Buddhism's chief utility is discouraging his men from fearing death. This adversarial relationship has continued over into the Guominjun's stay in Shaanxi, and they count few supporters among the Buddhist establishment.\n\nYan has taken a different route, perhaps because of the influence of Zhao or perhaps because of his desire for stability. He has attempted to cement his control over the Buddhist hierarchy, establishing Buddhist associations in every district headed by a loyalist priest. In Taiyuan's Chongshan temple, one of his crucial loyalists has been installed as the abbot, and Buddhist rituals have been strategically incorporated into the Heart Washing Society's weekly practices. It is unclear if these efforts to win over the Buddhists have been successful, but their support is essential for ruling the province."

 shanxi_political_events.14.t: "Finding the Way in Shanxi"
 shanxi_political_events.14.d: "There are plenty of less influential faiths in Shanxi, with a variety of adherents. Perhaps the largest is Daoism, a Chinese school of thought centred around \"the Way\" and taking considerable influence from Lao Tzu (\"the Old Master\") and his writings. Similar to Buddhism, Daoist temples have been raided by the Guominjun in the past and have received some limited patronage from Governor Yan. In particular the \"Court of the Way\" cult has been used in the past as a vehicle for Yan's attempts at social control. Their belief that their seances with the spirits of the dead, including not only traditional Chinese figures such as Confucius and Lao Tzu but also Abraham Lincoln and the Virgin Mary, represent a unique branch of the Daoist faith.\n\nOther smaller faiths include the \"Three Sects Faith\", a syncretic religion formulated from Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhist ideas. This sect exhorts its followers to \"do good\" along Confucian lines to acquire a fortune. Islam also has a presence in the region, with a small but present Hui minority. Yan has been accused by others of attempting to formulate a Chinese version of the Shintoism he saw while studying in Japan, fusing Confucian thought with nationalism.\n\nOf course, like most of China, Chinese folk religions (often co-existing with or incorporating Buddhism, Confucianism, and Daoism), often focusing on ancestor veneration and/or nature, hold the vast majority of the religious scene. One includes the Buddhist-inspired Jiugongdao (Way of Nine Places), which had grown in influence by Mount Wutai thanks to the influence of Li Xiangshan. Their influence has declined since then, though they retain control of various monasteries. The dynamism of all of these faiths, and the interaction between these various beliefs provide an insight into the cultural backdrop of Shanxi's political wars."

 shanxi_political_events.15.t: "The Doctrine of the Mean"
 shanxi_political_events.15.d: "In Yan's quest to promote a neo-Confucian revival, he has focused much of his governing philosophy around the so-called \"Doctrine of the Mean\", an interpretation of Confucian works on harmony and moderation. The Great War had a profound influence on Yan's life, and even though Germany's ultimate victory reinforced his authoritarian beliefs the utter devastation all participants suffered challenged Yan's previously solely materialistic vision. Wrestling with this, he joined other conservative Chinese commentators in declaring that the Great War \"would not have occurred if the West had heeded the teachings of China's sages\".\n\nAlthough Yan's moral pendulum has swung back towards a materialist-focused mass industrialisation programmes, he retains the belief that a moral revival is also needed to improve the spirit of his subjects and give them the virtue needed to see their modernisation progress through. Therefore, Yan has emphasised the neo-Confucian beliefs of the late Qing dynasty as well as philosophers such as Lu Jiuyuan and Wang Yangming. In order to suppress evil and achieve their innate goodness, his followers are called to subordinate their emotions and desires to the \"dictates of conscience\"."

 shanxi_political_events.16.t: "Revitalising the Heart Washing Society"
 shanxi_political_events.16.d: "Perhaps the most visible manifestation of Governor Yan's social agenda is the Heart Washing Society, a pseudo-religious organisation dedicated to creating a unified social morality. Meeting every Sunday in a temple, participants led by local authorities meditated and listen to sermons. The subjects and themes were frequently drawn from Confucian works, however, plenty of inspiration was taken from Buddhist and Christian beliefs as well. In particular, Yan urged a belief in a supreme being he claims has a basis in Confucianism, but contains concepts likely drawn from Christianity such as divine retribution for wrong-doing and a spiritual \"rebirth\" for adherents.\n\nPerhaps the most iconic part of this society's practices, however, is their practice of publicly confessing weekly misdeeds in front of one another. The congregation is invited to criticise the wrongdoer and castigate them for their crimes.\n\nOnce rather dormant, especially following Yan's defeat in the 1920s wars and the ensuing political catastrophe, it appears the society is once more out in force. Led by fanatics who remained loyal to the cause, this sudden burst in faith is most certainly connected to a state-sponsored push. Nonetheless, in these trying times, perhaps a little faith is necessary for the people to pull through with their tribulations."
 shanxi_political_events.16.a: "The sinner becomes degenerate in this life and an evil spirit in the next!"

 shanxi_political_events.17.t: "The Good People's Movement"
 shanxi_political_events.17.d: "\"The sinner, were there no law, and no heaven, and no fear of the scorn of men, would be a degenerate in this life and an evil spirit in the life to come! I, the Governor, warn you that every man ought to fear God, the law, and public opinion!\"\n\nAs the Heart Washing Society's influence grows, it is only natural that their words soon turn to action. In each village, the society has initiated a province-wide \"Good People's Movement\", hoping to install positive virtues among the people of Shanxi. Traits such as honesty and friendliness, facilitate being a good neighbour. Modesty, cleanliness and dignity too - in order to maintain proper etiquette and standing. In wake of the recent advances in the Ten Year Plan, diligence and thrift have been heavily emphasised as necessary for the province's workers and managers. But perhaps above all obedience, to the state and Governor Yan, has been extolled before all those who care to listen to Heart Washing sermons.\n\nOf course, plenty of the old problems remain. Officials often utilise the messages and funds provided by the Heart Washing Society for their own ends, and use language too formal and flowery for the commoners to understand. But there is less and less doubt with every coming day who is in charge in Shanxi, and what he expects of his people."
 shanxi_political_events.17.a: "To a greater future!"

 shanxi_political_events.18.t: "What the People Must Know!"
 shanxi_political_events.18.d: "Yan Xishan is a wise and venerable leader, with decades of experience managing his home province. It is only natural then that he shares some of his wisdom with his subjects, in a way that even the lowliest commoner may understand. Provincial authorities have for years printed millions of free handbooks, to be distributed to teachers, officials, and students across Shanxi. With subjects such as \"What Families Must Know\", \"What Village Headsmen Must Know\", \"General Information for Merchants\" and of course, \"What People Must Know\", each of these books provides detailed instructions for the consumption of the people in his domain.\n\nYan has also sponsored a variety of newspapers tied to his government, including the daily \"Village Talk\" and his lectures, slogans and sayings regularly are disseminated across the province to varying levels of enthusiasm through posters, travelling plays and newspapers. The last few weeks have seen Yan's administration ramp up their public relations efforts, and with his propaganda apparatus now in place, only one question remains..."
 shanxi_political_events.18.a: "what does the Governor want to say?"

 shanxi_political_events.19.t: "The Philosophy of China"
 shanxi_political_events.19.d: "Governor Yan has developed over the decades an eclectic ideology, with inspiration drawn from a variety of different sources. But as he seeks to enshrine his legitimacy not only in his province but on a national level, more and more the \"Model Governor\" must demonstrate that he is more than a savvy political operator or a cunning military officer. He must demonstrate that he is a leader, not only of men but of thought. And so, Governor Yan has begun to write down conclusively his thoughts for the future.\n\nYan Xishan's \"Philosophy of China\" begins with four guiding principles. 1. Self-preservation and self-reliance is both the ultimate goal and means by which China will be liberated. 2. Ensuring prosperity and profit are crucial for ensuring the well-being of the nation. 3. Being flexible and accepting contradiction is the best way to ensure the consolidation of one's rule 4. Be unconventional, independent and special, and show individuality when tackling the ever-flowing situation.\n\nHaving grown distant from Sun Yat-sen's ideology and long broken with the philosopher's party, Yan proposes a new version of the Three Principles of the People, one updated for the circumstances China finds itself in: Virtue, Knowledge and Welfare. As he continues his treatise, he unveils his designs for his homeland. A vision of a stable, prosperous and free China - built on the foundations of order, proper morals, and above all the obedience and faith of the people for their \"Model Governor\"."
 shanxi_political_events.19.a: "And so he defines his legacy."

 shanxi_political_events.20.t: "The Shanxi Kuomintang"
 shanxi_political_events.20.d: "Although hardly a syndicalist and wary of socialist influence, Feng Yuxiang decided to cast his lot with the Kuomintang in the fateful years of the 1920s. 1925 saw Feng Yuxiang study Dr Sun Yat-sen's lectures, particularly on the Three Principles of the People, and he saw it as a useful tool to bolster the control of his Guominjun army. Dr Sun's timely death in 1925 meant he was never a serious rival to Feng as a potential leader among northern revolutionary forces, and Feng widely distributed Dr Sun's lectures to his men.\n\nFeng's relationship with Dr Sun's successors and his Kuomintang was icier, an alliance of convenience that Feng hoped would give him access to sea following the Northern Expedition (and perhaps some Internationale funding). Feng seems to have only used Dr Sun's works on the Three Principles (which conveniently rarely mentions the Kuomintang), and was rumoured to have been mulling making a play for leadership of the party after Sun's death. Despite Kuomintang insistence, few in Feng's inner circle expected him to subordinate himself to the KMT (if anything, he hoped for the opposite), and the mutual defeat in the Northern Expedition rendered the point moot.\n\nStill, an alliance of sorts remains in the North - built in Feng's vision with the KMT as a junior partner to the much larger GMJ. The various Kuomintang groups (in particular the Reorganised Comrades Association) tend to find safe harbour in the Guominjun's ranks and provide an active, energetic left flank to Feng Yuxiang's movement."

The Guominjun increasingly stake their identity around their advocacy on behalf of the common people, and call-and-respond chants like the one above are common in the Guominjun ranks. Railing against foreign imperialism and warlord extravagance, an updated catechism denounces the cycle of Chinese disunity and foreign exploitation, calling the Laobaixing to seek justice through a great struggle. The final question of the catechism summarises things nicely:\n\n\"And what is the struggle (that Dr Sun Yat-sen exhorts us to engage in)\"\n\"Shedding one's blood for the Revolution; sacrificing one's self for a principle; holding on to the very end; an unyielding effort which must attain ultimate success\""
 shanxi_political_events.21.a: "That is what is meant by \"Struggling\"!"

 shanxi_political_events.22.t: "Charity and Comfort"
 shanxi_political_events.22.d: "Although Feng's own dedication to Christianity has waxed and waned over the years, he has never let up on utilising Christian principles to provide moral conditioning for his army. With death and injury common in a nation trapped in the throes of civil war, martyrdom is an all too common theme within the Guominjun ranks. Feng has established an Association for the Study of the Methods of Comforting to provide for both crippled soldiers and the families of the deceased. Military YMCAs bear the names of fallen officers and enlisted alike in bronze plaques along with notices of valour on the battlefield, while grand marble stones in drill fields likewise memorialise the dead.\n\nElsewhere, Christian-inspired charities and welfare institutions have been established by Feng's men. Nurseries for unwanted, illegitimate and orphaned children have been built for those under five along with dedicated orphanages for those between five and fifteen to learn trade skills. Homes for the blind, crippled, and elderly are also run by the Guominjun, along with shelters for the working poor like coolies.\n\nHygiene too is important, with fly-killing campaigns regularly initiated within Guominjun camps. Bathhouses for poor workers to clean themselves and their clothing after long days similarly dot Yan'an. All of these efforts, while perhaps holding idealistic foundations, also have pragmatic effects. They have won over many of the laobaixing to Feng's cause, and they will fight for him."

 shanxi_political_events.23.t: "The Political Department"
 shanxi_political_events.23.d: "After Feng joined the Kuomintang, he established a Political Department with the aid of Kuomintang and socialist advisors. Initially led by Liu Bocheng (who has since left the province), Feng kept the socialist-dominated institution under a relatively tight leash. The Department was rendered largely defunct with Feng's renouncement of his Kuomintang membership at the end of the Northern Expedition. Now, however, with Feng soon to be locked in a battle for control over Northern China, it becomes as necessary as ever for him to harness all the allies he can across the revolutionary spectrum. Feng has once again reactivated the department, filling it with crucial allies and encouraging its zeal.\n\nThe Political Department is once again establishing offices in each army, division, and brigade and deploying political officers from regiments down to platoons. On a platoon level, political cells are being organised. In practice, implementation has been hampered as it did in 1927 by a lack of ideologically trained personnel and inconsistent expectations for staff and roles. Some have interpreted this move as creating political officers, while others see the department as a propaganda arm. The ambiguity however does not diminish the rising radicalisation of the Guominjun and its preparation for a national revolution."

 shanxi_political_events.24.t: "The Other Republicans"
 shanxi_political_events.24.d: "Not every republican in Shanxi is a socialist radical or a member of the Kuomintang. Although censorship is pervasive in [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], privately intellectuals of all stripes regularly gossip and discuss China's future. Although not quite as refined as in Europe or along China's coast, nationalism as an idea has been permeating the province for decades, taking form in various shapes both revolutionary and conservative.\n\nMany students and faculty read newspapers and publications from Beijing, familiarising themselves with the politics of the capital. The rural reconstruction ideas of Liang Shuming and Y.C. (James) Yen's CERA floats around some circles, while some find sympathy in the Prosperity League's \"progress expositions\" funded by the AOG. Quite a few take inspiration from the south, with the federalist ideas of Chen Jiongming and the democratic ideas of Zhang Junmai (Carsun Chung) being quite popular as well.\n\nThe activists aligned with the Guominjun have worked to make inroads with republican groups in Shanxi, hoping to secure a broader base of support. Many moderates however are reluctant to work with the populist and revolutionary army, even with the possibility of toppling Yan Xishan's regime. For most in the middle and upper middle classes, the stability the governor has brought outweighs the political oppression. Democracy in Shanxi, much less China as a whole, remains a very distant possibility - but that has not stopped many from dreaming."

Feng sits and talks with his officers in giddy anticipation, as they await for the play to begin. Production had begun after news came of brutal violence against anti-concessionist protests in Nanjing, a testament to the cruel oppression European and Japanese powers have placed the Chinese nation under. Feng himself is said to have contributed money, and the seats are bursting with officers and soldiers waiting for the curtains to be raised.\n\nThe author, a long-time Guominjun officer, enters the stage wearing his finest dress uniform. Despite his nervousness, few notice, as he speaks in a humble but crisp voice - thanking the audience for coming. He explains that the play is a representation of the 1936 massacre of anti-concessionist protests at Wuhu and other cities in the League, and how Feng asked him and his soldiers to perform. He apologises in advance for the literary quality, as he is not a writer by trade but a patriot. But he hopes through his work to inspire the patriotic spirits in his comrades, and closes his remarks with a loud voice to roaring applause: \"foreigners are shooting our brothers and plundering our country. How can anyone think we should not arm ourselves?\""

Each lay out their grievances to the audience.\n\n\"We work sixteen hours a day, but only receive 30 cents!\"\n\"We are poorly fed, with such meagre wages we cannot afford food!\"\n\nThey are soon joined by a group of street merchants and farmers, similarly dejected. Likewise, they go one at a time as they cry out to the audience:\n\n\"The foreigners are ruining our trade!\"\n\"The foreigners steal our bread from us!\"\n\nA group of students then come on stage, with tattered books and holding signs.\n\n\"We study all day and try to learn for our country, but there are no jobs for us!\"\n\"They take our tuition and mock our culture, and teach us nothing but lies!\"\n\nThe actors pause for a moment to allow the words to sink into the audience.

As the audience begins to boo loudly, they proceed to open fire on the crowd. Several fall dead and others run, though new protestors begin to join them. A white flag is handed from the wings to the front of the crowd reading in large letters:\n\n\"We demand justice!

He concludes with the remark\n\n\"Do you really not think we should take up arms?\"\n\nThe actors wait until the clapping and cheers die down before a wounded man climbs onto a stretcher. He cries out\n\n\"They have knocked out my eye, but it is better to lose both eyes than to see China's shame!\"\n\nThe relatives of the dead and wounded protestors come onstage, crying and mourning. They are led by an old woman (played by a soldier), who delivers the closing address\n\n\"They have killed two of my sons and wounded a third and I am left alone in my old age. Yet if I could still bear more children, I would again birth a son so he may fight for China's freedom!\"\n\nThe theatre roars with clapping and applause, with the audience delivering a standing ovation.

A number of anti-communist songs have been written, one of which goes\n\nThe Guominjun cut people down like grass\nWhether rich or poor, few escape.\nThe rich must awake; the poor must be made to realise that everyone will suffer if socialism triumphs.\nAlas!\n\nIndeed, ever since the Guominjun first arrived in Shaanxi, the Governor was less afraid of their military might as much as the appeal of their radical agenda on the province's long-suffering peasantry. He wisely noted that \"the job of suppressing revolution is 70% political and only 30% military, while the job of preventing its growth altogether is 90 per cent political.\" Nonetheless, Yan has mobilised an \"Anti-Socialist Militia\", a paramilitary drawn from the younger members of the gentry.

Agitators in [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] have grown bolder in the classrooms, in study societies, and in illegal union meetings, all to weaken the foundations of Yan's power base. But perhaps their greatest tool is the words of their revised catechism of their movement:\n\nSection 3: Justice\nQ12: That our brother laobaixing should toil ceaselessly and yet be without food clothing and shelter while those who do no work of any kind have the finest luxuries. Say all of you, is that just?\n A: It is not\nQ13: If those who love idleness, but also enjoy said luxuries while engaging in wild profligacy and extravagance, say you, men, is it just?\nA: It is not\nQ14: Since this is so, what should you do?\nA: We shall advocate justice\nQ15: How will you advocate justice?\nA: We shall have everyone have food, clothing, homes and money.\nQ16:Where will you begin in order to carry out this programme?\nA: Our first step is to not harass and not let others harass the commoners. Our second is to secure land and employment for the people.\nQ17:And what more should be done?\nA: Workers shall eat, toilers shall eat, but the idle shall meet with our intervention!\n\nOther sections include a copy of Sun Yat-sen's will, the Wuyuan Oath, and reflective questions on sacrifice, duty, and anti-Imperialism.

Accompanying him are large bands playing cheery songs such as the \"Hymn to the Federation of Municipalities and Workers\", energising the audience and creating a festival-like atmosphere. In addition to stops in Shanxi proper, he boldly moved his speeches into the Guominjun powerbase itself in Shaanxi, holding one of such rallies in Yan'an while any dissenters could do nothing but watch.\n\nHe concluded his tour with an address in [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], where hundreds of thousands (perhaps over a million) citizens listened as the speakers praised the governor's efforts at building a \"paradise\" in their province, while the Governor himself spoke at length about the future he promises for the faithful. Afterwards, Yan's finest soldiers and many students from Taiyuan's universities marched down the streets under torchlight, shouting their slogans and waving signs in support of their leader. This show of strength, while not necessarily winning over any enemies he has made, has at least solidified recognition that Yan stands as the master of Shanxi."

The situation was not kind to him at the time, Guominjun troops had been pushed out of Beijing earlier that year by a resurgent Zhili force. But as the Kuomintang began their northern expedition, Feng Yuxiang saw his chance, and on that day swore his men over to the cause of Dr Sun Yat-sen.\n\nMany years have passed, but while delivering his speech today before the gathered Guominjun remnants, Feng could not help but reference it once again. He assures the crowd that he has not forgotten the oath, nor will the Guominjun ever forget. The tyranny that grips China will be shattered, and the nation rebuilt for the people. After he finished, just like then in 1926, the crowd roared with cheers of \"Down with the foreign powers! Root out the warlords!\", a cry so resounding that it took several minutes to quiet down.\n\nDr. Sun's successors have long proven themselves unworthy, but the man's principles continue to stand.

 shanxi_political_events.33.d: "With the technological advance of photography, it is now more than expected to see photos printed in newspapers or even footage in cinemas, not to mention that films were already made as both propaganda tools and even military lecturing materials by the powers. In the past decade, watching movies in cinemas for news and entertainment became a trend sweeping the globe. Shanxi will not be an exception. Feng Yuxiang, the Christian General, is well aware of the power and potential of propaganda in motivating his soldiers and constructing a good image of his cause, especially after the tremendous success of the People's Theatre. When he was reading a newspaper article about cinemas and foreign nationalist films in Shanghai in his crude wooden house alone, an interesting idea popped up. In the past few weeks, he has been trying to contact photographers willing to shoot a film for him, and it is said that the product will be shown in the People's Theatre.\n\nAs expected, curious crowds who would be watching a film for the first time filled the theatre, behind the heads stands a giant projector and a Guominjun officer. As the officer starts operating the projector and the lights go off, the audience holds their breath. A great white circle faded in on the wall with a standing silhouette. When the image becomes clear, people recognised that the half-naked man is Feng Yuxiang, and he is performing a sword dance in front of his soldiers, footage of Feng awarding medals to his soldiers with his great smile and sitting and discussing military plans with his officers then followed.\n\nAlthough this film is silent, the ordinary behaviours of Feng Yuxiang shown in it, especially waving his sword like a soldier, remind the audience that, before rising as the famous Christian General and the head of the Guominjun, Feng was simply a Laobaixing and ordinary soldier, like most of the audience."

 #SHX Educational Reforms Events:
 shanxi_education_events.0.t: "Educational Reforms Near Completion"
 shanxi_education_events.0.d.yan: "Despite all odds and considerable opposition, Shanxi has finally achieved the scientific and technical prowess necessary to create a domestic foundation for its Ten Year Industrialisation programme. Working with the (admittedly heavily rotted) foundation of Shanxi's prior higher education systems in Shanxi University, Shanxi's People's Normal School, and various technical schools that had been established over a decade ago, the recent push has seen the rot excised from the system and replaced with a new, stronger set of supports. Utilising foreign-trained academics, domestic technicians, and a great deal of spirit, incompetent and undermotivated professors have been replaced or retrained while the students have been brought under control either by carrot or stick. College campuses, while still a place where students enjoy leisure, have seen a considerable decrease in vices that had previously turned them into dens of iniquity. Campus libraries, long-shuttered because of a lack of usage, have reopened as a new generation of promising students study for a future in building a new Shanxi and China. Professors and academics have received funding from the government to engage in research in the province, engaging as equal peers with those in Beijing, and soon perhaps the world.\n\nThere remain plenty of problems in Shanxi, no doubt in part due to the inherent inequality of focusing on higher education. While some scholarships have been distributed to the lower classes, the vast majority of students are from the monied classes. Still, few can doubt that Shanxi is considerably better off than it was at the start of the decade."
 shanxi_education_events.0.d.feng: "Despite all odds and considerable opposition, Shanxi has finally achieved the Universal Primary school education that has long been promised. Working from a foundation built during earlier reform periods in Yan's rule and inspired by Feng's ambitious mass education programmes during his campaigns, Shanxi's young children now have access to a modern curriculum across the entire province. This access includes the most desolate, poorest regions of the province, which have received government funding and trained teachers brave enough to bring modernity to even the most underserved. At school, students are taught not only how to read and write using newspapers and government circulars (an accomplishment on its own), but also practical vocational skills such as animal husbandry, arithmetic, agricultural sciences, craftsmanship, and technical skills. Other life skills such as ethics, hygiene, childcare, and languages such as English, Japanese and Classical Chinese all round out to one modern education for the Chinese people.\n\nChildren are not the only ones benefiting from Shanxi's ambitious education programme. Adults who have spent their entire life toiling in the fields or factories are finally given an opportunity to advance themselves by taking night classes and learning how to read for themselves. Women's education, which has long been neglected and treated as secondary, has seen a revival in educational focus - with higher enrolment of women in primary schooling. Although there remains much to be done about the quality of education in Shanxi, and higher education has begun to lag, few can doubt that Shanxi is considerably better off than it was at the start of the decade."

 shanxi_education_events.1.d: "To say education in Shanxi is lacking would be quite an understatement. While few will doubt that Shanxi's government has made considerable strides in the first decade or so of Yan's rule reducing illiteracy, wars and disruption have sapped away the funding necessary to keep up the momentum Shanxi's previous push for educational attainment had created.\n\nAt the primary level, many students refuse to attend class despite the mandate for all students to attend four years of schooling, staying home to help at farms or learning a trade. Many schools are underfunded and hastily built, contributing to a negative perception of these schoolhouses. The middle schools are scarcely better: ever since Zhao Daiwen's harsh and draconian rule as Principal of the People's Normal School spawned a mass student uprising, the government has lived in terror of future unrest. The government has since lost most control over these schools - students regularly cheat on exams and intimidate teachers that don't give easy scores or are seen as too foreign. The Student Association, once established to protest Yan's authoritarianism and also Western Imperialism in 1925, has grown corrupt and directionless over the years, standing for little except halting changes to the status quo.\n\nHigher education is no different - Shanxi University is effectively a vast, government-funded resort where professors gamble their meagre wages with their students, and teachers are so incompetent that the mechanical engineering professor was useless when the University power plant went out. Foreign professors and those trained in the West, Beijing and Japan all regularly fight, while corruption soars.\n\nWith all of these numerous issues, it is clear that perfect is the enemy of good. Shanxi is best off focusing its efforts in a limited scope for now, and after deliberation that will be..."

 shanxi_education_events.2.t: "Ren Zhigong Comes Home!"
 shanxi_education_events.2.d: "Many of China's best-educated sons hail from foreign alma maters, highlighting the depths to which the nation has fallen across the Century of Humiliation. Many of these go on to work for foreign firms, or stay close to the coast where they can make a better living and enjoy the western luxuries they have grown accustomed to. Indeed, Shanxi's government used to sponsor select students to go abroad until they found that returning students have grown too rebellious and accustomed to Western living. Shanxi has instead attempted to focus on training students at home - to questionable success.\n\nAs the province pursues educational reforms, Zhao Pilian (the Principal of the People's Normal School and de facto Minister of Education) has put out the word that Shanxi University is hiring. Few have responded, and fewer are men of good quality, but one has stood out - Ren Zhigong (also known as CK Jen), a youngish scholar at Tsinghua University in Beijing.\n\nA man born to poverty in Shanxi, he went through the early stages of Shanxi's educational system before being admitted to Tsinghua at age 15 in 1921. He went on to study at MIT, the University of Pennsylvania and acquired a PhD in Physics at Harvard, all in a few years. Such a distinguished scholar was difficult to recruit, but he claims to be inspired by a sense of patriotism and by our genuine effort at reform (no doubt reinforced by our very generous paycheck). As a faculty member he has his work cut out for him - the library at Shanxi University is said to have closed due to a lack of patronage.\n\nMuch of the higher education in Shanxi (at least when things are taught) is technical in nature rather than theoretical, and the Shanxi government has demonstrated considerable mistrust towards scholars from Beijing. We will see if this young man can truly embody the spirit of Shanxi's educational dream."
 shanxi_education_events.2.a: "A well-respected man."

 shanxi_education_events.3.t: "Student Union Strike"
 shanxi_education_events.3.d: "Hearing about our renewed efforts at reforming education, the Shanxi Student Association has decided to order a general strike, refusing to attend class and even intimidating teachers and students that do. While there were some in our government that hoped they would be too disorganised and moribund since the last time, it appears the students are out in full force against our reforms, fearing a further loss in status. Indeed in Shanxi a frequent complaint is that middle and college graduates simply \"graduate and join the jobless\" at a time when the economy is undergoing tremendous changes and employment is scarce.\n\nThis is not the first time of course this has happened. Zhao Daiwen, a draconian Principal of the People's Normal School, was so harsh in suppressing dissent in the 1920s that he threw one of his sons in prison and exiled another for student participation - strongly distrusting Beijing-trained students. This failed to stop student radicalism, and when news came out in 1925 that the Entente intended to hand over Shandong to the Japanese, this touched off a small anti-Imperialist riot in Taiyuan, with the Student Association boycotting foreign goods. Although quickly dissipated, later when taxes were raised on students, a massive strike and rioting forced Yan to relent and fire Zhao.\n\nZhao Pilian was his replacement, and his more conciliatory approach towards students has given them greater power. Since the People's Normal School educates the teachers, this has de facto handed control of much of education to the Student Association, who have utilised their power to intimidate instructors deemed too pro-foreign, strict or otherwise angered the student body. Sometimes, strikes are called simply to prevent attending exams or to extend winter break, contributing to the breakdown of Shanxi's education system.\n\nIt appears that our efforts to reform education will require us to wrest some control back, setting us on a collision course."

 shanxi_education_events.4.d: "\"Too often, teachers don't care what their students study and make no effort to teach them anything they will find useful in the future. The result is many students are attending school for the purpose of providing a living for scholars!\"\n\nEducation in Shanxi is... a process, as [Root.GetLeader] and his latest complaint would indicate. While primary schooling, for all of its faults, generally sees decent attendance, middle schooling has largely been overlooked in favour of primary and higher education. Encompassing about six years of education (due to translational issues, \"Middle schooling\" in this context incorporates both middle and secondary/high school education), for many in Shanxi it is far too expensive. Indeed, given the relative lack of opportunities, students that skip school and learn practical trades in their teenage years tend to be more employable than their studious peers.\n\nThe Shanxi government, in their effort to promote education, has dramatically lowered fees for middle schooling and is even considering mandating such education in hopes of creating a modern education worker base for the Ten Year Plan's industrial sector. This has seen considerable pushback from conservatives and parents who worry about their children's prospects and resent the increase in costs. Perhaps it wouldn't hurt to look the other way sometimes."

 shanxi_education_events.5.d: "In a time of warlordism and frequent violence, it is no wonder that both Yan and Feng have independently come to the conclusion of the need for greater militarisation in education. In the 1920s, Middle school students were given uniforms, regular military training and exposed to a harsh regimen of discipline, virtue and obedience. Punishments were harsh and eventually provoked a revolt. Both strongmen remained interested in these programmes, crediting militarised schooling with allowing for Japanese ascendency.\n\nHowever, parental pushback and general disinterest have seen these programmes mostly lay fallow, with the Boy Scouts mostly wearing nice uniforms and playing soldier rather than learning to become one. Athletics remains one of the few remaining elements still in active practice, with a strong emphasis on a healthy body and the Provincial Athletic Association remaining well functioning. Attempting to reassert these militarised programmes will no doubt take time and create a certain lasting change in the culture of Shanxi. But perhaps it simply must be done."

 shanxi_education_events.6.t: "Dealing with the Students"
 shanxi_education_events.6.d: "As Principal of the People's Normal School and thereby the head educator of educators, Zhao Pilian has always had a tough position. In recent days, he has been tasked with ending the student strike that has consumed much of [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Compounding the challenge is that the students lack a defined leader, with different groups within the Student Association pushing for various objectives. Still, some consistent student demands have emerged, including easier exams, promises of high-paying jobs, and exemptions to military service. Many students feel highly unemployable due to Shanxi's dysfunctional education system, despite the vast amount of technical job openings that they often aren't qualified for.\n\nConvincing his superiors will not be an easy task either - many of the student leaders were trained in Beijing and have radical ties. While their fears are understandable, many of their demands are simply unreasonable or contradict the goals of the Ten Year Plan - and there is no guarantee that it will appease enough students anyway. Zhao's old rival in the education department and the recently appointed chair of the Village Inspection Committee Feng Sizhi has seized this opportunity to advocate for taking a hard line, reasserting power on the delinquent students. He has found an ally in the Commissioner of Police Nan Peilang, another Yan appointee. Sending the army to break up the strikes as the government has done previously is only likely to further radicalise the students, pushing them into the arms of unsavoury groups.

Republican agitators meanwhile often seek radical reform, including liberalisation and the abolishment of the monarchy and feudal remnants. Some engage in acts of terrorism in East Shanxi and Xi'an, destabilising Beijing's control. Yan's own neo-Confucian Heart Washing Society has also seen a measure of independence, now that many of the less motivated have left, the fanatics remain.

His solution in turn to save China's agricultural sector is the creation of special agricultural schools, replacing the old system of arrogant Mandarins overseeing the oppressed peasant.\n\nDrawing attendees from both the farming and intellectual class, those learning at the first Experimental School were referred to as \"apprentices\" as opposed to students, hoping to instil a humility and lack of prejudice that would allow them to work alongside the peasants. They were encouraged to engage in local life, attending local festivals and staging plays and running clinics in turn for the farmers. In the area where this was established, socialism was kept in check, keeping the area loyal to the government. The school even had an official journal known as \"New Village\", highlighting the dreams of progress it embodied.\n\nNow, [Root.GetLeader] hopes to expand this project and build more schools like it across the province. There are of course many pitfalls ahead, no doubt in part due to the lesser oversight than the original school. But if successful they will become a model for agricultural reform across China!"

 #SHX Agriculture Reform Events
 shanxi_agricultural_events.1.t: "Land Reform in Shanxi"
 shanxi_agricultural_events.1.d: "Shanxi's agricultural sector is built upon its rivers, which have deposited a thick layer of alluvium onto Shanxi's valleys. The poor quality of land in the hilly, mountainous province means that agriculture is concentrated in the valley of the Fen River to the South, the Taiyuan basin in the centre, the valley of the Hutuo River to the north, and the Datong basin. Although tenantry is mostly unfeasible in many areas, in those where the land is fertile it has exacerbated inequalities - breeding considerable resentment and strengthening the domination of the gentry.\n\nInitially, Yan Xishan was a strong proponent of investing in the countryside, seeing it as a means of reversing the trade imbalance that plagues Shanxi. Indeed, Confucian classics he read tended to focus on agriculture, though prior attempts to wrest some control from the gentry had seen even members of his home town turn away when he visited. The gentry's sabotage efforts seem as hostile to their interests, while an increasing number of tenant farmers have grown sympathetic to the Guominjun since they arrived.\n\nPrior attempts at developing Shanxi's agricultural sector have earned mixed results despite (or perhaps because of) its ambitious goals, and drought has crippled Shanxi's agricultural sector every year since 1934. Although the Ten Year Plan's primary focus is on industrialisation, any effort at industrialising will require a stable land policy as its foundation.

Thanks to the tireless efforts of Shanxi's bureaucracy and efforts to maintain a certain balance of power between the peasants and the landholders, Shanxi's agricultural sector has finally achieved stability and prosperity for the people living there. While the elite still controls village leadership and much of the land, the district magistrates serve as a check and efforts to crack down on the abuse of litigation as a means of intimidation have created a sense of fairness. A token amount of land has been redistributed, growing the class of yeomen farmers.\n\nUtilising Shanxi's limited arable farmland, the farms in Shanxi produce a mixture of traditional cereals and grains as well as more profitable cash crops - notably cotton. These efforts are supported by small factories and workshops that deal with agricultural-related products, as well as a growing system of agricultural educational institutions. In all, Shanxi has managed to create a more fair and more productive agricultural sector - while still avoiding the radicalism that would've destroyed it all."
 shanxi_agricultural_events.2.d.feng: "The endemic poverty and inequality that has plagued Shanxi's rural regions has finally given way to radical change! With the peasants long stewing at the chronic abuses by the rural elite and the Shanxi government tiring of the intransigence of the gentry, Shanxi's leadership has opted to pursue the perennially delayed promises of land reform. Rather than seek a measured series of reforms, recalling prior failed efforts being watered down or sabotaged by the rural wealthy, instead [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has opted to attempt to shatter the gentry's grip altogether. This has meant considerable redistributions of land (sometimes at gunpoint) and the targetting of unfair rents.\n\nTensions have fired up in the countryside, with rural landowners hiring militias and appealing to the central government for support. But they cannot stop the tide of radicalism by the peasants, who have hopped on the chance to change their status, or at least exact some measure of revenge. Damage has been done, not just to the infrastructure of Shanxi, which can be repaired, but also to the balance of power in Shanxi. And many questions remain about whether or not the government can control this maelstrom they've released, or whether or not this movement will last for long before it is quashed."

If we are to properly fund our agricultural efforts, we must find this money somehow. In front of [Root.GetLeader] and his staff are a few options, none of them particularly easy.\n\nThe first would be to simply slash Shanxi's unprofitable projects, many of which are relics of past efforts at agricultural improvement. These include sericulture, the production of silk, which failed because of Shanxi's cold and dry environment (perhaps introduced in the first place due to excessive reliance on Confucian classics). Another such effort includes importing Merino sheep from Australia in hopes of breeding them with the hardier but less attractive local sheep to create a Shanxi proprietary blend. The peasants took poor care of them (perhaps intentionally, to avoid higher taxes) and a lack of trained veterinarians meant most of them died due to rinderpest.\n\nThe second would be to seek additional funding from the central government. This would put us into their debt, but on the other hand, it would allow us to receive fresh money from outside rather than simply move money around from within the province.\n\nLastly, there is the tried and true method of raising taxes within our province.

 shanxi_agricultural_events.4.d: "Decades apart, three men have pursued careers in education. Fittingly enough, a stark contrast can be drawn between those who attended Normal Schooling before and after the Xinhai revolution. The eldest is Lian Tianxiang, a graduate of Japan's Agricultural University. A successful winemaker, he won international prestige for his home province with his Yiquan Yong winery in Xinghua village. Soon after, he gained the attention of Yan Xishan, who made him the Principal of the Shanxi Public Agricultural College. He went on to serve in the Shanxi Higher Agriculture and Forestry School, and continues to be a prominent advisor in agricultural affairs.\n\nNext is Su Tiren, a graduate of Shanxi's own Provincial Normal School prior to the revolution, who went to Japan to continue his education and returned as a trained chemist in 1916. Serving on the staff of a middle school, he rose through the ranks and has cultivated close connections with the gentry - believing stability in north China to be of paramount importance. Su since became a leader of Yan Xishan's \"Think Tank\" of aligned scholars, editing many of Yan's public works and serving as a close counsellor.\n\nLastly, Wei Yechou attended Beijing Normal School in 1917 amidst the turmoil rolling the post-Xinhai China. An early member of China's socialist movements and a middle school teacher in Shaanxi, it was not long before he led students and other revolutionaries in Xi'an against warlordism and became a prominent member of Shaanxi's Farmer Association.\n\nThe three men in many ways symbolise the vast gulf in ideas between the different factions vying for control of Shanxi's peasants and fields.

The few that have demand not only \"fair\" compensation for their properties in hard currency, but also a scaling back of reforms. The gentry have made no secret that they've been reaching out for help from the central government, with Wuhan newspapers accusing us of socialism and Beijing formally urging us to abandon our plans.

They have recently made a major find - since 1923 Governor Yan has decreed that in order to prevent another such famine, village headmen were required to collect from each family grain to be stored at local temples. These temples were supposed to be put under the custody of village elders, but as Village Inspection Committees have made their rounds across Shanxi's villages, they have found that extensive embezzlement has occurred.\n\nThe scandal implicates headsmen in dozens of villages, including some connected to the clans of prominent figures such as Zhao Daiwen, who have been accused of misappropriating for their personal use not only funds but the temple itself for their own use. This is a major victory for the province's auditors, though some have advised that we tread carefully.

Although much credit can be given to the wisdom of prior decades-long projects of self-reliant and protectionist industrialisation policies, few can doubt that the recent addition of extensive foreign funds has been anything short of pivotal in building up Shanxi's industrial capacity. Churning out a mixture of consumer goods such as cigarettes, matches, paper and flour, as well as chemicals such as sulphates, potassium chloride and potassium carbonate, Shanxi's previously skyrocketing unemployment has plummeted.

The next more immediate step will be to develop our mining interests, but we have come a long way towards our goal of reversing the trade deficit that has dominated our economy."
 shanxi_industry_events.0.d_Feng: "At last, after mobilising every last bit of energy and effort the people of Shanxi could muster, we have finally begun to achieve meaningful industrial success. Although much credit can be given to the wisdom of prior decades-long projects of mass industrialisation, few can doubt that the latest push by the people of our province has borne considerable fruit in boosting Shanxi's industrial capacity to a competitive standard. While the primary focus of these efforts has been military and heavy industry via state planning, our factories also produce some light industry for our province's needs such as cigarettes and paper. Many of Shanxi's previously unemployed people have been mobilised to work, and our province has been gaining the technical prowess needed to build an industrial hub in [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Our planners excitedly are beginning to outline new projects, and we're building momentum for a lasting change.\n\nChallenges remain of course, as our efforts to build this industry have come at a heavy cost. Faith in our currency remains in doubt, and having driven off many foreign investors we will have to continue scrounging up capital on our own. Our next step will be to begin supplementing our mining industry, continuing our road to reversing the trade deficit!"

 shanxi_industry_events.1.t: "Our Path Towards Industrialisation"
 shanxi_industry_events.1.long_intro: "The bulk of Shanxi's industry is concentrated around the Taiyuan basin, and it shall be the centre of Shanxi's efforts at developing an industrial region. Shanxi for over a decade now has seen multiple efforts at industrialising the province, each starting and stopping with varying levels of success. Shanxi's business community lags behind even others in China, heavily insular and nepotistic in thinking - not well adjusted to the needs of the modern capitalistic modes of thought. This stagnancy has hurt Shanxi and stalled efforts at developing a domestic industrial base. Still, there remain quite a few state-backed factories and workshops (granted not always particularly profitable), a limited trained technical workforce, large mineral reserves of coal and iron, as well as some progress towards expanding rail connections with the rest of China."
 shanxi_industry_events.1.warwithQIE: "$shanxi_industry_events.1.long_intro$\n\nOur current war with the [QIE.GetName] government has effectively forced us to look inwards for strength. This would mean doubledowning on existing insular, autarkic policies that have kept Shanxi economically independent albeit likely at the expense of greater growth. The realities of wartime nonetheless mean that a centralised, government planned development will be necessary if Shanxi is to survive the conflict."
 shanxi_industry_events.1.d_Yan: "$shanxi_industry_events.1.long_intro$\n\nYan Xishan's clique, despite the governor's personal affinity towards state intervention as a means of mass industrialisation, has proposed a dramatic overhaul in its approach towards foreign investment. While maintaining the \"State Capitalist\" approach, these planners led by Shanxi Provincial Bank President Wang Xiang have suggested that Shanxi has mostly tapped out of its own domestic resources and should try and secure more foreign capital. This would mean appealing to the Beijing business community, which while still dealing with Black Monday, has some capital to invest and also have the technical skills to truly revitalise the economy. This is not without issues of course - Beijing's merchants will surely be followed by its government and moreover many have extensive partnerships with German and other Western investors. This will surely agitate the anti-concessionist and xenophobic feelings in Taiyuan, but to members of Yan's clique they have no choice."

 shanxi_industry_events.2.t: "The Unprofitable Coal Pits"
 shanxi_industry_events.2.d: "When Yan Xishan first became governor of Shanxi in 1917, all of the province's mineral wealth was declared property of the state. Although in practice this did not mean nationalisation, with the newly formed Shanxi Bureau of Public Mines allowing private owners to do as they pleased, Shanxi's government controls shares in virtually all mines of note. Yan himself was believed to secretly hold many additional shares, helping further control the mineral wealth of the province.\n\nShanxi's large reserves and profitable industry have not been doing so well as of late, however, with war and corruption and the loss of control of Suiyuan and East Shanxi causing production to plummet. As a result, despite Shanxi's higher quality and larger reserves, Shanxi is heavily outcompeted by foreign-owned firms in Shandong and Hubei. Domestically, the wealthy further refuse to invest in coal pits unless it guarantees immediate and large profits, and the conditions at Shanxi's mines are horrendous. Quite a few miners are literally prisoners, ex-convicts sentenced to work in deadly conditions.\n\nShanxi is in desperate need of capital for its industrial programme, and its leading economic experts have proposed liquidating Shanxi's shares in unprofitable mines, arguing that it will raise money and possibly create more efficiency. Some however fear that the foreign interests that will come will plunder Shanxi and the exploitation will aggravate the already suffering people. Governor [Root.GetLeader] is called to make a decision."

 shanxi_industry_events.3.d: "\"Corruption is the worst evil afflicting the bureaucracy!\" [Root.GetLeader] is said to exclaim, and there's been talk about executing dishonest officials or forcing them to commit suicide. Although this is mostly just talk, a recent scandal has pushed this to the limit. As Shanxi rushes to develop its domestic industry, a parallel effort is underway to expand railway connections outside of Shanxi. The perennial habit of Shanxi bureaucrats to appoint friends and family of questionable competence has come home to roost when dozens of officials in charge of the railway projects have been exposed for helping swindlers defraud the Shanxi government.\n\nFurther reports suggest that embezzlement is rampant and compensation meant for the peasants/artisans is frequently stolen attracting considerable anger. Worse, many magistrates use this project as an excuse to collect extra \"taxes\" despite clear orders to the contrary. [Root.GetLeader] is livid, but his advisors have cautioned that while harsh punishments may initially soothe public anger, bringing attention to the corruption is likely to dampen support for the Ten Year Plan in the long run."

Anger has begun to bubble in [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] as the rapid changes caused by the Ten Year Plan have created significant uncertainty among Shanxi's growing proletariat. Cramped living conditions, poor workplace safety, and low wages, all are adding up. Unemployed students at Shanxi University have begun to join in, causing the risk of further radicalisation and the dissemination of \"disruptive thoughts\".\n\nThe [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Municipal Labour Union has organised a general strike with the help of the Kuomintang to protest the uncertainties many of the working class are facing, accusing Shanxi's leadership of being out of touch with the people. Yan has in the past sent the army to stamp out strikes and outright banned unapproved unionisation (accusing them of being infiltrated by Syndicalists), but the large scale of these growing protests threatens to completely disrupt production if not handled correctly.\n\nSympathisers in the administration point out that Shanxi is supposed to be turning a new leaf in their march towards progress, and should the people not expect some promise of benefit out of their sacrifices? Indeed, while the union tend to be dominated by KMT-RCA figures, arresting them risks further radicalisation of the movement. In the end, however, it is up to the calculating mind of [Root.GetLeader] to do what is necessary."

Troupes of student actors have been paid to travel from town to town, singing to the tune of \"seedling songs\". Keeping the people motivated in this trying time is critical, as Shanxi appeals for extensive help from the laobaixing. The commoners, for their part, appear to enjoy these shows even if they are not always convinced by them."

 shanxi_industry_events.6.t: "Shanxi Levels a Salt Tax"
 shanxi_industry_events.6.d: "News has emerged from our people in [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] - the warlords there have elected to collect a salt tax \"on our behalf\" from the people, no doubt to raise money for whatever nonsense \"economic programme\" they claim to be initiating to justify lining their own pockets. Salt is a valuable commodity in China and a critical source of revenue. While Shanxi once had a thriving salt industry of its own, those days are largely passed and salt usually comes in from outside merchants. More importantly, however, salt taxes have traditionally been the domain of the central government, and for [SHX.GetLeader] to hijack our revenue in this way is a grave insult to our authority.\n\nA potential means of retaliation has been proposed. Using large amounts of cheap salt from the coast, we can flood the provinces around Shanxi with salt at prices so low no one will buy any of Shanxi's. This will definitely burn bridges but it will cripple Shanxi's effort at raising funds. On the other hand, we could simply let this go and make a point to stress how generous we are in giving them this \"tax rebate\", reaffirming our ultimate sovereignty over Shanxi."

 shanxi_industry_events.7.d: "Alas, our efforts at raising funds by taking control of the salt tax have been met by retaliation by the central government. No doubt incensed by our decision to stop shipments of our hard-earned money they believe entitled to, it appears that large quantities of salt mined from the coast have found their way into provinces neighbouring ours.\n\nThis competition has significantly undercut prices, and our merchants struggle to compete with the significantly cheaper salt products from the shore. In retaliation, we have opted to expel some of Beijing's representatives and have increased restrictions on trade from their provinces, but the damage is likely to slow down our progress towards industrialisation."
 shanxi_industry_events.7.a: "Sneaky rats."

 shanxi_industry_events.8.t: "Beijing's Generosity"
 shanxi_industry_events.8.d: "Having heard of our recent assumption of control over salt taxes in our province, the central government has refrained from any unreasonable provocation and instead given their public blessing. In their words, the money is being \"given\" to us as a sort of tax rebate to allow for the \"stimulation of economic resources to strengthen the nation\".\n\nBeijing-aligned propagandists have made sure to push this narrative across [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to a surprisingly effective degree despite how pretentious and transparent their self-aggrandising has been. Still, we got our money, and the government's pathetic attempt at reasserting control over the situation is tolerable."

A shining capstone that will anchor it all together and be the symbol of progress yet to come. Two proposals have been put forward, each having merit.\n\nThe first proposal is to build a grand steel mill. Some say the lack of bread is not likely to destroy a nation, but without steel mills, a nation is lost in this day and age. No doubt this is an exaggeration, but a modern steel mill would certainly be a tremendous asset to continue feeding our industry.\n\nOn the other hand, the second proposal is to build a modern automobile factory. As Shanxi industrialises, the middle class is expected to grow and a new demand for cars, trucks, tractors and other vehicles will naturally follow. The military applications of this factory are also readily apparent.\n\nIn the end, after careful deliberation, [Root.GetLeader] has opted to..."

Unlike the Germano-British-Beijing aligned syndicate, which has arrived with tremendous fanfare to purchase various pits at en masse auction with the intention to resell shares to investors at home, a series of private investors have purchased select mines.\n\nAlthough innocuous to the average observer, the careful, coordinated nature of this effort eventually revealed the truth: all of these investors were affiliated with the Tung-chi Mining Corporation, a company headquartered in Tianjin. Moreover, the vast majority of these stakeholders are Japanese. While they have hardly caused any trouble and have drawn far less ire from anti-concessionists in [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] than their counterparts, something feels a bit... off."

Under the circumstances, few would blame them for merely doing their jobs and following orders - but many have gone above and beyond in the service of the Ten Year Plan and Shanxi by engaging in thorough research into new techniques to innovate and optimise their foundries.\n\nThis has resulted in the creation of new charcoal-burning engines for buses and the emergence of domestic potassium chloride, potassium carbonate, and electrolytic salt series of production lines. Moreover, many engineers have sought to exploit Shanxi's rich deposits of sulphur - helping further the progress of our Ten Year Plan. [Root.GetLeader] has been so pleased by this that he has considered setting aside a large sum from his personal funds for the creation of an Academy for Research into Natural Sciences - something his ministers are weighing contributing to."

We cannot turn back time and there is no use trying to preserve an outdated system, but we can do something to preserve productivity and help keep people employed.\n\n[SHX.GetLeader] has initiated the creation of \"Common People's Factories\", a modernised, mechanised factory system that will assist the rural economy. These small-scale handicraft factories - while not exceptionally profitable - will help bridge the gap in skills and allow the Chinese people to adapt to the machine age."
 shanxi_industry_events.12.a: "We train them for a new era!"

 shanxi_industry_events.13.t: "Dealing with Old Business Clans"
 shanxi_industry_events.13.d: "One of the first challenges we encounter when trying to bring Shanxi to a modern economic age is the business community themselves. Shanxi's business clans are extremely traditional in many ways, and not fully adapted to the realities of modern capitalism.\n\nWealthy businessmen for the most part refuse to go into business with anyone but family members, and disdain the impersonal nature of modern industry. They also tend to expect an unlimited liability for debts, which further chokes industry. When money does reach an enterprising young man's hands, it is often expected that they share their recently found gains with their less diligent family members, or spend nearly all of it on lavish weddings and other displays of wealth rather than reinvest it into more capital.\n\nAll of this needs to change. However, as new investors come in, the transition has hardly been seamless. Old tactics such as induced fluctuations in currency values and usury have made for an unfriendly environment for new traders, while the old business clans complain of regular exploitation from the much more worldly and better-trained merchants from Beijing. The government is forced to step in."

 #SHX Power Struggle Related Events
 shanxi_power_struggle_events.1.t: "The Struggle for Shanxi Starts"
 shanxi_power_struggle_events.1.d: "Ever since the retreat of the Guominjun to Shanxi, Governor Yan Xishan and Field Marshal Feng Yuxiang have presented an image of strong friendship - swearing to become blood brothers. This has held Shanxi together as a neutral and stable state for nearly a decade, as the former opponents in the northern Chinese political arena banded together against the mutual threats of Wu Peifu and Zhang Zuolin. However, over the years, Yan Xishan has known that he must be wary of Feng Yuxiang's influence. Yan's power has traditionally been with the provincial government, as the officially recognised governor of Shanxi and the centre of a delicate web of various entrenched interests. Feng, on the other hand, stakes his power in his control of the powerful Guominjun, a nationalist and comparatively revolutionary army that has been noted for its fanatical zeal. Combined, their strength has deterred Wu Peifu and the central government from taking any serious action against the region since stripping Suiyuan from Yan, but as the tides change in China it would appear this alliance simply cannot last.\n\nBoth men are proud leaders with a distinct vision for how Shanxi, and indeed China should be run. Shanxi is a poor province, with few resources and little time to accommodate even one agenda for its future. The previously lethargic and widely ignored Ten Year Plan, implemented in 1930 as the province reeled from its latest defeat, has suddenly attracted considerable attention from both parties as they seek to bolster their legitimacy across Shanxi. It is also no secret that outside observers are watching too - no doubt Shanxi's future leader hopes to prove themselves as a \"Model Governor\" and a potential candidate for leadership of China!"

 shanxi_power_struggle_events.2.d: "The battle for Shanxi will be waged between Yan Xishan and his clique (Paternal Autocrats) vs Feng Yuxiang and the Guominjun (Authoritarian Democrats) for control over Shanxi. In the decision menu, a mission called 'Looming Guominjun Coup' will slowly tick downwards. In addition, the strength of the Guominjun can be viewed over there as well. Various events, focuses, and decisions will either increase or decrease the timer and the strength of the Guominjun.\n\nYan and Feng have different interpretations of implementing various elements of the Ten Year Plan as well as reforming the military. Favouring one side or the other will generally give them an advantage (Yan desires a weaker GMJ and longer timer, and vice versa). Be warned, however, that the opposing party will also be implementing an agenda of their own and will not go down without a fight.\n\nTo end the struggle, one of the sides must emerge victorious. The standard way for each side to win is to reach at least 95% strength in the balance of power. Alternatively, the Guominjun will win if the timer reaches zero while Yan wins by selecting his decision to purge the GMJ (which becomes available once GMJ strength is below a certain threshold). Yan will also \"win\", albeit unconventionally, should an outside force invade Shanxi while the power struggle is active. Stability will be affected proportionately to the strength the other side retains upon victory.\n\nBe further warned that the government in Beijing will have the ability to influence this struggle as well."

 shanxi_power_struggle_events.3.d: "Feng Yuxiang's gamble has failed! About a week ago, a series of arrest warrants were served across Taiyuan - detaining thousands of suspected traitors and potential fifth columnists. Meanwhile, the Shanxi Provincial Army set out to Yan'an with instructions to restore order and oust the Guominjun from the province. Marching proudly across Shaanxi, the locals were largely indifferent if not cheering for the GMJ's elimination, and there was little resistance against the esteemed Governor's elite, well-equipped army. Caught off-guard and unprepared to confront Yan's Taiyuan-made artillery, the Guominjun was shattered in battle. An attempt at a prolonged insurgency was put to an early grave by the peasants themselves, who have reported most of the GMJ to the authorities. Bounties have been placed on GMJ members like the bandits they are, and it is clear who commands the loyalty of the people of Shanxi.\n\nWhen the dust finally settled, Yan emerged victorious, retaining control of his beloved province after a speedy purge. In addition to the Guominjun, the Yan clique has persecuted student radicals, leftists, and other republicans unwilling to cooperate with the established government. Feng is believed to have fled to Russia, hoping to acquire funding for a return, but he is unlikely to get it now that his movement has been discredited. It will take a few weeks to clean up the damages, but given the circumstances, things went about as well as they could have. Yan remains master of the province, but whether or not this will be enough to be a contender in northern China remains to be seen."

About a week ago, advanced groups of Guominjun troops began advancing from Yan'an towards Taiyuan, screening the route ahead for the GMJ's large columns. Yan's army was sent to meet them, larger in size and better equipped. But they soon were ambushed, isolated and overwhelmed in small groups - it is clear that this Guominjun rapid advance would not be possible without the extensive loyalty of the people. The Shanxi Provincial Army certainly got the message and began to rout, throwing away their precious Taiyuan-made artillery and expensive rifles. A desperate attempt by Yan Xishan to prepare for a siege in the capital and await reinforcements from Beijing was foiled by a palace coup led by General Shang Zhen and other officers, republicans and students in the city. Yan's decades-long rule is at an end!\n\nWhen the dust settled, Feng emerged victorious - having captured Shanxi in a quick, almost bloodless revolution. Many gentry members, businessmen, and Yan loyalists have fled, though the remaining factions have largely sworn fealty to the Guominjun. Yan for his part is speculated to have fled overseas with much of his wealth, though rumour has it that he merely returned to his home village of Hebian and is in de facto house arrest. It will take a few weeks for the new government to absorb the remnants of the Yan clique, but given the circumstances, things went about as well as they could have. But for all the jubilation breaking out across Shanxi, Feng and his generals know it definitely won't be this easy making it to Beijing."

This system allows them to wield extensive power (or at least whatever power they can scrounge up) in virtually all facets of life.

Whether or not they are of any use to us is up for question.\n\nWith many of Yan's closest advisors being instruments of oppression or otherwise ideologically incompatible with our revolutionary goals, many of our own camarilla would recommend that we simply purge these men.

Whether because they sensed weakness in the Shanxi clique's division or due to the failed machinations of the province's strongmen, foreign invaders have moved against both Taiyuan and Yan'an, forcing the two men who once swore to become blood brothers again into a desperate alliance.\n\nIn an urgent series of negotiations brokered by leading military officers such as Shang Zhen and Xu Yongchang, the terms were set. Yan Xishan will take the lead of the new government, while Marshal Feng will remain the second most powerful man in the land. Socialist agitators fostered by Feng and his Guominjun are to be purged from the ranks, while Beijing-aligned collaborators in Yan's government are to be similarly expelled.\n\nThe submission of the Guominjun to Yan's civilian government marks a great victory for the latter, however, the more ambitious plans of both men have been dashed. Feng and the Guominjun have missed their chance at usurping power from Yan, though Yan's own ability to consolidate power fully has likewise been lost. In the meantime, both the Guominjun and the Provincial Army find themselves fighting in the trenches hoping to keep enemy forces at bay.

 shanxi_manchu_coup_events.1.d: "It wasn't even a year ago when Feng Yuxiang walked out of Taiyuan in a conspicuous display of disapproval towards Yan Xishan's dealings with Beijing. And yet, once again the competing factions of the Shanxi clique find themselves at the negotiating table, this time weighing the repercussions of a plot being set in motion in the national capital. Governor Yan has signed onto a pact with Manchu nobles, disillusioned intellectuals, and disaffected central army officers to utilise recent mass public protests in light of the League fiasco to topple Zhili control of the nation once and for all. If successful, a decapitation strike against Zhili high commanders Wu Peifu, Cao Kun, and Wang Chengbin will leave them leaderless in the chaos.\n\nThis plot is not without risks, but the fate of Shanxi is intertwined. Should Wu find out and march out against the Shanxi clique, both the Provincial Government and the Guominjun will surely fall together. And the rewards are plenty - Feng has his doubts about the plot's actual ability to successfully consolidate control over the nation, but exploiting the opportunity to weaken the Zhili and secure critical territory in the northern Chinese plain would greatly strengthen the influence of both men.\n\nIn the presence of their senior officers, a deal is finalised between both men with infamous egos: Feng and his armies will secure their previously held territories south of the Yellow River, while Yan and his loyalists will rule over the northern section. Should they reach Beijing, Yan will depose the Manchu Emperor and the republic will be restored under their diarchy."
 shanxi_manchu_coup_events.1.a: "Feng shakes his hand, reluctantly."

 shanxi_manchu_coup_events.2.t: "The Fall of Xi'an"
 shanxi_manchu_coup_events.2.d: "Not a day after Cao Kun and Wu Peifu's bodies crumpled to the floor, the joint forces of the Shanxi Provincial Army, the Guominjun, and anti-Zhili loyalists in the Central Army swung into action. As the Manchu princes and their allies worked to secure Beijing and ward off any Fengtian intervention, the coalition forces to the west made their move. Yan Xishan ordered his provincial army, mustering every many they could to arms, under his leading commanders Fu Zuoyi and Xu Yongchang towards Eastern Shanxi, firing massive salvos against entrenched Zhili forces meant to guard the mountainous approaches. Their objectives are to secure critical railway infrastructure leading southwards and to link up with allied forces in Beijing.\n\nTo the south, in the region of Guanzhong, the Guominjun swept across the Yellow River in a daring effort against unsuspecting Shaanxi garrison forces under Governor Liu Zhenhua. Frantic Zhili efforts to reinforce the provincial capital at Xi'an were thwarted by the activation of local guerrilla cells aligned with the Guominjun in the countryside, who rose up in great numbers to support Feng Yuxiang's advance. Before even the advance elements of the Guominjun could arrive, these insurgents seized the city with the support of locals.\n\nThe speed to which the coup is unfolding across the central plains has astounded even its plotters, who are now forced to contend with the very real possibility that they will be forced to actually govern northern China. Still, Wang Chengbin remains at large, having escaped any efforts (if there was one) to detain him. Although Xi'an is expected to fall soon, the Zhili remnant are likely to make their stand further south from Wu's traditional powerbase in Wuhan."

 shanxi_manchu_coup_events.3.d: "As the war against the Zhili continues into its latest week, it seems the former masters of China are now in disarray with their leading commanders out of the picture. Xi'an has fallen to Guominjun forces, and Feng Yuxiang has ordered his men to sweep southwest towards Wuhan. He has met fierce resistance however in the city of Luoyang as he tries to reclaim his former territory in Henan.\n\nMeanwhile, coalition forces in Beijing had split into two groups, with a large force left behind to guard the border with Fengtian while the smaller component advanced southwards to link up with their allies. Yan Xishan's Shanxi Provincial Army shattered Zhili forces guarding Eastern Shanxi, retaking full control over his native province. He has since ordered his men to rapidly push eastwards to seize the Jinghan railway, and its capture this morning marks a decisive turning point in the war.\n\nCut off from Zhili bases in Wuhan, remaining loyalists north of the Yellow River have surrendered giving the so-called \"Central Plains Alliance\" near total mastery of the north. The remaining garrisons at Baoding have surrendered to Marshal Yan, handing him control of China's premier military academy. As his subordinates mop up Zhili remnants, Yan heads to Beijing, his ambitions racing far faster than his railcar."

 shanxi_manchu_coup_events.4.d: "The assault on Luoyang was slow, far slower than Feng Yuxiang would have wanted. After weeks of fighting, the critical city in Henan did not fall until reinforcements from other coalition forces arrived to surround it from the north and east. Even then, Zhili forces mostly retreated from the city in good order, leaving the victors to now fight amongst themselves. Although Yan had promised him control of territories south of the Yellow River, the new city administration (many members of the old one), have largely bucked his commands. Efforts to replace them with revolutionaries aligned with the Guominjun have met staunch resistance from other coalition partners.\n\nThis was not the only thing concerning for the revolutionary general however. In Beijing not a week prior, Yan Xishan accepted the title of Imperial Commissioner and Commander in Chief of the Imperial Army, the honours once bestowed upon Wu Peifu. If Yan was planning to depose the Emperor, as he had promised, he certainly was taking his time. Confronted with the very real possibility that he was going to be betrayed, Feng Yuxiang summoned his Thirteen Taibao for a new plan.\n\nLaunching a coup within a coup, the \"Traitor General\" forestalled any future perfidy with an aggressive assault into Shanxi, hoping to knock out Yan's power base before he could consolidate power. Having rapidly redeployed his forces, the sudden advance into western Shanxi caught Provincial Army forces by surprise, perhaps aided by the defection of staunch republican officers like Shang Zhen, charged with holding rear positions. Taiyuan itself has been lightly secured by anti-socialist militias rallied by local gentry members.\n\nWith shots already fired and the Guominjun bearing down on the new Imperial Commissioner's headquarters in Taiyuan, a new phase of the war has opened. Neither side is particularly equipped for a conflict this size, both already exhausted by the fighting against the Zhili and overstretched by the territory they have absorbed. Still, whatever the outcome the fate of northern China will likely be determined in the coming months."

Battered, and with the combined forces of Yan and his allies in Beijing now having a solid grip over northern China, an agreement has been signed between the former \"blood brothers\". This ceasefire at the status quo will allow for Feng to consolidate his position (and likely prepare for another offensive against Yan), and for Yan to finish off the Zhili.\n\nNeither particularly are pleased with the outcome, but a continuation risks Feng losing to the superior resources of the Qing government over time and Yan potentially wasting critical resources fighting for impoverished mountains. The Zhili remnant may be effectively vanquished, but the weakness of their replacement has concerned many. The threat of Japan and their Fengtian lapdogs loom, as does the rumblings of various challengers in the south.\n\nThe balance of power in northern China, once seen as considerably more stable than the various provinces in the former League, has irrevocably shifted. In what direction this will take however, remains to be seen."

The foolish men we have decided to ally with bungled their mission, were discovered and have since been purged by a vengeful Jade Marshal. Under interrogation they revealed our involvement, not that our amassed supplies and mobilised armies did not give that away. The Zhili are coming for their revenge, and we have little time to prepare.\n\nAll hope is not lost, though we are in a position of severe disadvantage. As was before, our province is guarded by two powerful (if diminished) armies on their own right. It is too late to pursue any large-scale integration, but a joint command has been hurriedly erected in Taiyuan between Guominjun and Provincial Army generals. With the mountains and rivers to protect us, our wise commanders, and the courage of our soldiers, we might be able to keep the Central Army at bay.\n\nBe warned though, that this conflict will not end any time soon.

Instead, we are forced to find a base of operations for the future until unification.\n\nIn the past the Guominjun has had its headquarters in Yan'an, in the northern part of Shaanxi province. A smaller city, it is the base in which our army has operated from and is far more secure from enemy invasion. Our existing infrastructure exists there, and it is likely an effective war-time base.\n\nWe have also recently captured the historic city of Xi'an, one of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China. In addition to its historic importance, it is also connected to vital rail infrastructure. The people in the area are generally sympathetic to us thanks to prior work in earning their trust, but it is vulnerable to enemy counter attack. Moreover, its actual importance in Chinese politics has declined over the last few centuries, with the massacre of Manchus in the city during the revolution further destroying its value.\n\n[SHX.GetLeader] must make a choice soon, as we work to establish some sort of impromptu military infrastructure to replace the ones we lost in Taiyuan.

Our worst fears were confirmed recently with the uncovering not just one but multiple spy rings within our administration. Taking advantage of systemic corruption, internal pessimism, dissatisfaction with [SHX.GetLeader], and perhaps some genuine admiration for Japan, various intelligence agents working from Taiyuan have thoroughly infiltrated both our bureaucracy and military.\n\nOur counterintelligence probes have primarily implicated lower level officers and magistrates so far, but it is clear that the rot extends even higher - including the cabinet and high command.

He accuses us of trying to undermine his autonomy, and scheming to make an ultimate invasion far easier for our forces.\n\nOutrageous accusations aside, the collapse of these talks highlights the economic isolation of Shanxi since the start of the century. Once one of China's wealthiest provinces and hosting the heart of China's banking and commercial centres, changing circumstances at the start of the warlord era plunged it into deep poverty. The region remains nominally aligned with our government, with Wu Peifu unable to fully oust Yan or Feng towards the end of the 1920s. Delusions of grandeur aside, they are not much of a threat, though perhaps as a testament to the lingering tensions our forces continue to occupy the eastern portion of the province - leaving its governing status ambiguous."

 shanxi_qing_aid_events.2.d: "With all the chaos and numerous exchanges going on within the halls of power in Beijing following the collapse of the League and Black Monday, it would have been easy to miss a telegram that came in a few days ago. It was only after sorting through several stacks of mail that the message made it to the eyes of the intended recipient. Written by Yan Xishan, who only a few weeks ago rejected our generous offer for economic assistance, has sent us a new offer of partnership.\n\nNoting the shifting tides in China's political atmosphere, with many alliances fraying and our own security threatened by developments in the North and South, he points out the necessity for stability in China's west. While careful not to make outright promises, his message clearly indicates his willingness to seek a closer relationship between Beijing and Taiyuan, though he notes that such an arrangement would require a mutual willingness to support one another. Of course, reading between the lines the majority of this cost will likely be borne on our end.\n\nWith many far more pressing issues to deal with at the moment, Wu Peifu has elected to move on to his next order of business rather than craft a dedicated response. However, he pointedly did not throw out the telegram."

 shanxi_qing_aid_events.3.t: "Beijing's Interests in Shanxi (Explained)"
 shanxi_qing_aid_events.3.d: "The interaction with Taiyuan is critical going forward for crafting Beijing's strategy with regards to defending their west flank. Although a very poor and industrially almost barren province, both Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang intend to mobilise every resource they can to build up an army capable of once more challenging the powers that be through their \"Ten Year Plan\" mechanic. Covering matters industrial, agricultural, and educational, on top of other efforts dealing with the military and society, Shanxi is likely to be a thorn in your side. They will hope to strike in the almost inevitable confrontation against Fengtian or a potential Southern menace, exploiting your vulnerability to overwhelm your underdefended west.\n\nThankfully however, your faction has multiple arrows in your quiver. For one, Shanxi's economic malaise cripples Shanxi to almost comical levels, and they will likely need outside investment to get into reasonable shape. This offers Beijing an opportunity to expand its influence in Shanxi, a resource measured in \"Beijing Influence\" levels (measured between 0 and 100%). On Shanxi's end, their early game content will often offer them multiple opportunities to trade an increased foreign influence for an improved economy. On your end, as Shanxi goes down its various trees decisions will (temporarily) open up to wedge your influence into their province.\n\nThis can be utilised in a couple of ways. Passively, Shanxi donates civilian factories to you proportionate to your influence. You can also elect to spend your influence in a few ways as well. It is possible to have your agents influence provincial politics towards Yan Xishan (who, unlike Feng, can potentially become an, admittedly unwilling, ally), and moreover dampening their war support will weaken their ability to take key decisions to betray you. Diplomatically, a higher amount of influence will unlock key options later on with negotiations over Shanxi's future, allowing you to potentially tame the province.\n\nGreater investments in Shanxi will make them stronger, but be careful to keep them on a tight leash. Conversely, ignoring them will almost guarantee them to be an (albeit weaker) threat in the future, something worth keeping in mind in your planning."

With considerably more resources than the locals, left unchecked this poses an imminent threat to [SHX.GetLeader] and his own powerbase.\n\nOptimists say that this increased influence may ultimately be beneficial and represent a closer alignment with Beijing.

 shanxi_qing_aid_events.5.d: "Although China has been mostly insulated from the worst of Black Monday's effects, and we in Shanxi are further protected by our distance from China's main commercial hubs, that does not mean the aftershocks of the worldwide economic depression have not reached Taiyuan. Workers have been laid off, businessmen struggle to find buyers, and unemployed intellectuals grow restless. Something needs to be done to stem the disastrous wave of layoffs, lest discontent turns to anger.\n\nA new option has recently emerged, with the approval of a considerable relief package from the National Assembly offering considerable aid to our people in mitigating the effects of Black Monday. This is not a scenario without worry, however. There are considerable strings attached to this package, and although financial in nature they carry considerable political undertones. However, explaining our rejection to the people will likewise be no easy task, and financial experts have implored the Governor to accept this deal."

 shanxi_qing_aid_events.6.t: "Beijing Merchants Buyout Companies"
 shanxi_qing_aid_events.6.d: "Our recent efforts to privatise the Shanxi economy has invited a host of outside speculators to purchase state-owned industries. This of course is a double-edged sword, even if we nominally continue to hold a majority stake in these businesses, especially since there has been a downstream effect of local private businesses being bought out or out-competed by wealthier enterprises from outside. While these investors have touted the increased efficacy in our commercial and manufacturing sectors thanks to their superior management and technical capabilities, many locals cannot help but feel cheated. Small merchants fearing the loss of their livelihoods have coalesced around nationalistic groups, while workers dreading further abuses by their distant bosses have sought the protection of the socialists.\n\nAppeals have come into the Governor's office imploring him to do something to put a stop to these conglomerates. The cabinet is heavily divided, with defenders noting that this was the desired efficiency the government sought in the first place, and moreover that these companies have done nothing wrong. Others however worry about the unrest this has stoked in the people, moreover worrying that the central government is the true power behind these multi-national conglomerates. At the end of the day, a decision is reluctantly about how to view these companies..."

 shanxi_qing_aid_events.7.t: "Beijing Merchants Entrenches Their Grip"
 shanxi_qing_aid_events.7.d: "Our efforts to liberalise our economy have not gone unnoticed by investors. A large consortium organised in Beijing (no doubt with some political intervention) has begun to consolidate their Shanxi holdings into a few industrial syndicates. Workers and regionalists protest that these moves by large businesses have created a de facto monopoly - the very thing we sought to avoid by selling off state shares. Indeed, this has taken a geopolitical bent as even some leading members of the administration point out that our economy is coming increasingly under the control of foreign actors, with strings being pulled by shadowmen far from the view of Taiyuan.\n\nProponents of these changes dismiss these claims, arguing that a motley group of radicals are grasping at invisible straws to try and stop what is likely an inevitable change. Shanxi has seen a tremendous increase in wealth and efficiency since these companies have come in, and trained intellectuals, businessmen and technicians have followed them. To them, the greater investment is nothing but a win-win, a case of aligned interests. Shanxi grows wealthier, and the rest of China does as well."

 shanxi_qing_aid_events.8.t: "Agricultural Relief Package"
 shanxi_qing_aid_events.8.d: "Upon hearing about our ambitious Ten Year Plan projects to improve the agricultural sector, the National Assembly has passed an aid bill to help us. While many applauded this move, opinions have soured in some sectors. Although nominally sponsored by figures in the Rural Reconstruction Movement, it appears that other interest groups have had considerable influence on what was expected to be an uncontroversial bill. The provisions, while still being studied in further depth by the government, appear to broadly favour the gentry and other large landowners at the expense of small farmers and tenants.\n\nNaturally, this has attracted considerable backlash - inflaming tensions already brought to the forefront by our Ten Year agenda. Various rural agitators have been trying to stir up the peasants to protest, claiming this recent initiative is proof that the central government has no interest in genuinely helping the people. Experts however have begun to defend receiving this aid, noting that Shanxi needs modern tools, training and above all funding that this initiative will provide. And of course, the gentry have been won over, demanding that the Governor allow this aid to go through to lessen the damage Black Monday and several years of flooding have done to the province."

 shanxi_qing_aid_events.9.d: "In both 1933 and 1935, China's leading educator and expert on providing modern education to the masses James Yen visited Taiyuan to consult with Governor Yan and his subordinates about fighting illiteracy in Shanxi. Although our propaganda machine was careful to make the most out of the various compliments Yen paid for our decades-long youth education initiatives, and minimise the critiques he made, he was right that although Shanxi has come a long way since 1911, plenty more has to be done.\n\nIt is said that he was pleased that our energised Ten Year Plan has included a renewed focus on education, though owing to the situation in Beijing he has declined to visit us again this year. However, it does appear that the National Assembly has approved a large grant to sponsor another push to teach all Shanxi children the basics of reading and writing. As a secondary effect, it has also prompted an increase in communication between Taiyuan University and other Chinese institutes.\n\nAccepting this grant however will not come without some strings attached of course, though virtually all leading authorities in education have pleaded with [ROOT.GetLeader] to do so for the sake of the children. A few reactionary members of the government have stubbornly attempted to dissuade the Governor from this course of action, arguing that the urban intelligentsia are infested with socialists, radicals, and fools. To them, Shanxi has already perfected its own curriculum, and is better off on its own."

 shanxi_qing_aid_events.10.d: "Having received extensive training from German advisors and with a considerably higher budget, the army employed by the Central Government has long menaced our borders - forcing us to retreat from even the borders of Shanxi itself! And yet, perhaps as a sign of the changing times in China, we have received an offer from the staff at Baoding Military academy to send a training mission over to Taiyuan to enhance the quality of the provincial army. Along with the necessary staff, several train cars full of equipment will be provided as well.\n\nThis is certainly a massive step up from the quality of advice given to us by the various mercenaries we have hired or lessons learned from the \"green forest\". Learning the modern ways of war, the latest from Europe (or so they claim), would greatly enhance the quality of our soldiers.\n\nHowever, the high command (dominated by Guominjun and other ex-Zhili officers) is reluctant to work with their central government peers. Many stubbornly insist their experiences on the battlefield across the 1920s more than exceed anything the central army officers can provide, and that the province would be better off if our men are trained by Shanxi officers directly. Others snidely note that corruption is endemic in the army, and say the real reason for this resistance is fear of losing their jobs.\n\nIt should be further pointed out that nearly all the senior officers in command were themselves trained in Baoding, and therefore have strong feelings both ways about interacting with the modern Baoding staff."

But they have certainly made their mark. In their wake stands a powerful division equipped and trained with a modern military curriculum, their officers and NCOs informed with modern tactics and doctrines. The enlisted have been taught necessary skills such as logistics, communications, and combat, and have been shaped along Baoding lines.\n\n[SHX.GetLeader] is said to be nothing short of impressed, congratulating this new division for their hard work and their evident (if not yet proven) quality. A question remains, however - shall this division be a temporary unit or a permanent one? There are merits to both suggestions - keeping it together will allow for an easier time preserving its quality and avoid excessively diluting its combat effectiveness. However, it will take considerably more time for the lessons learned by these men to disseminate across the army if they are kept together, and multiple advocates argue we are better off having the men of this division begin training units in other divisions across the province."

Still, compared to the revolutionary populism that makes up Feng Yuxiang's nationalist movement, and the numerous bridges Feng has burned in his wake, Yan is far more reliable by comparison.\n\nAs a result, it seems that in recent days the Central Government has mobilised some of their assets in the province to shore up support for Governor Yan in his struggle for power. Some pro-Yan think tanks among universities here, or winning over supporters among merchant clans there, or rallying the gentry in the countryside - all these little actions can go a long way to ensure Beijing's favourite remains on the throne."

Thankfully, rather than march an army to destroy it, as they nearly did during the Fourth Zhili-Fengtian war, they have merely (albeit extremely forcefully) placed a large order for equipment. This will severely disrupt production for the next few months, but it has increased the prestige of our province's cornerstone of defence and has given our central bank some liquidity in terms of balancing the provincial budget.

A teacher by trade, he has mentored quite a few of Shaanxi's leading social revolutionaries, including many in high positions in Shaanxi's small Kuomintang branch and more importantly the Guominjun. The latter association had earned him the attention of Feng Yuxiang, a long-time ally who had previously appointed him head of his Political Department.\n\nWei's appointment to formal office within the Shanxi government has earned major pushback, however, especially among the conservative gentry and merchants. They have grown to resent his multiple attempts to organise farmers' associations and militias, and fear his plans for the future. Now imbued with considerable power by Shanxi's government, he is expected to implement considerable changes to Shanxi's countryside. Many hope he succeeds."

 shanxi_advisor_events.3.d: "Zhao Pilian left the Governor's Mansion with a smile on his face and a mission. Long-serving as the esteemed \"Principal of the People's Normal School\" that title often downplayed the difficulties his tenure brought him. The students were frequently rowdy, and though he was able to win over some of their trust negotiating with the chaotic Student Association, it was easy to feel overlooked and underappreciated as the lead instructor of all future teachers in Shanxi. Today, however, was a little different - [Root.GetLeader] has elected to formally appoint him as Minister of Education and has allocated his newly formed ministry with a significantly larger budget than expected.\n\nWhile Zhao had long filled this role de facto anyway, the increase in funding and de jure authority was readily appreciated. However, much remains to be done with the state of education and the seasoned magistrate has every reason to expect that it will take the better part of his career to meaningfully change the system. Still, this is a vital day forward and already plans are being drawn up in his mind."

 shanxi_advisor_events.4.d: "When it comes to matters pecuniary in nature, it is only natural that [SHX.GetLeader] turns to a familiar hand in Shanxi's provincial finance. Wang Xiang, the long serving President of the Shanxi Provincial Bank, has always been a de facto leader in Shanxi's economic affairs - advising Governor Yan for years in these matters. His distinguished career as an educator turned capitalist has given him experience in the fields of mining, industry, and banking, making him a natural appointment for Minister of Finance of the [SHX.GetName].\n\nHis loyalty to the local administration has come into question as of late however. As part of his role as a policymaker within Shanxi's Provincial Government, he has been asked in the past to represent Taiyuan in matters related to the Zhili-backed central government. Burdened by the need to make up for budgetary shortfalls and perhaps a nationalistic desire to work towards Chinese unification, Wang is known to have affiliated himself with a clique of like-minded industrialists.\n\nWith his new found power, he is expected to encourage economic liberalisation and private investment. The barriers to economic success shall be eliminated. Chinese unity and strength will be found through this new prosperity commerce brings."

 shanxi_advisor_events.5.t: "Zhao Daiwen's Appointment"
 shanxi_advisor_events.5.d: "As an established member of the Shanxi provincial hierarchy, Zhao Daiwen's recent elevation in prestige is more of a confirmation of the status quo than a genuine promotion. Still, behind his venerable facade lies a crafty political operator that has greatly assisted his friend and mentee Yan Xishan for many years. A Confucian-educated scholar who was educated in Japan, Zhao is also a devout Buddhist and a former Tongmenghui revolutionary.\n\nLong sitting at Yan Xishan's right hand, he has placed himself at a centre of an expansive web of political connections, one that [SHX.GetLeader] hopes to utilise for his own ends. Of particular note is his pet project, the Heart Washing Society, which he has leveraged his recent promotion to secure greater funding for. Although the heyday of the society has since passed, a core group of fanatical neo-Confucians remains - seeking a powerful leader for their cult of personality. Zhao Daiwen might not be that man, but he is eager nonetheless to see the society expand."

 shanxi_advisor_events.6.d: "In an era defined by intricate personal relationships to counteract the shifting loyalties of warlord governments, perhaps a little bit of nepotism is hardly out of the question. Liang Huazhi, the nephew of Yan Xishan, is a student radical with a sudden rightward turn. The speed of the Ten Year Programme and the social strife it expedited, created many similarly minded individuals and gave a fertile breeding ground for a young man determined to make his mark on Chinese history.\n\nInducted into the previously semi-defunct \"Blood and Iron Society\" founded by his uncle and 28 of his classmates in Japan, Liang has worked to expand its spiritual successor in the \"Blood and Iron National Salvation Corps\", sometimes referred to as the Sacrifice League (a name shared with other fanatical anti-Imperialist groups in the province). Like the Dare-to-Die corps of the Xinhai revolution, martyrdom is often expected from its members to advance revolutionary goals. This pseudo-totalitarian group largely serves the interest of furthering the Yan Xishan cult of personality."

 shanxi_advisor_events.7.d: "In the darkest days of human existence, sometimes it takes a holy man to lift the people from their suffering, or at least try to alleviate the pain they feel. In Yu Xinqing's ministry in China, his aim is to go even further, bringing about a revolutionary change in existence that will at least eliminate the crushing poverty and oppression of the laobaixing. His elevation by the powers that be reflect the culmination of a lofty career, melding spiritual duties with political aims.\n\nA former personal chaplain of Feng Yuxiang, Yu represented a civilian, socialist, and Christian wing of the Guominjun. He has worked to carry out Feng's ambitious social policies in the past including serving as an educator during Feng's administration of Kaifeng and becoming the Director of General Affairs for the Guominjun. His latest assignment, the formation of an pseudo-governmental organisation he calls the \"Economic Committee of the People's Revolutionary Government\", is his latest effort to bridge the gap between the aspirations of the [SHX.GetName] and the needs of the people on the ground."

 shanxi_advisor_events.8.d: "Ren Zhigong, or as his peers often refer to him - CK Jen - often felt like a big fish in a small pond. Ever since he returned to Shanxi, although much had changed since his youth, the province remains considerably poor and educationally (among other things) backwards. Machines regularly fail, the staff are not up to par, and many of the students refuse to attend class. Still, if he had any regrets about leaving his post in Tsinghua, he didn't show it today as he met with [Root.GetLeader].\n\nWith the recent effort at improving education and creating a competitive scientific base to complement the growing technical sector, Ren was pleased to learn that he has been given a substantive grant from the government to build a new wing at Shanxi University and engage in the physics research he had been forced to put off since he returned home. Moreover, with the money he has received, he can finally hire trained staff and repair those outdated, fickle devices he had been forced to rely upon. As the chief scientific advisor to the government, it seems all of his life's tireless work since his impoverished upbringing has finally come to mean something."

 shanxi_advisor_events.9.t: "Lian Tianxiang's Appointment"
 shanxi_advisor_events.9.d: "The Governor's latest choice for an appointee is perhaps the safe one - Lian Tianxiang, a long-time leading educator in Shanxi's agricultural institutes and a one-time internationally recognised representative of the province's agricultural success. He has been chosen to lead the similarly prestigious School of Village Education, a model academy within the province that aims to promote a modernised take on training farmers and farm managers.\n\nAlthough his prestige has waned considerably since his gold medal at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition, his expertise it appears has only grown with decades of experience since the 1915 World Fair. His plans for the province are rather conventional - a series of irrigation, communication, and agronomic projects that will revitalise the agricultural industry. With tensions still high between the agitated peasant farmers and the powerful landlord clans, it is up to him to navigate the middle way forward."
 shanxi_advisor_events.9.a: "Congratulations Headmaster!"

 shanxi_advisor_events.10.t: "Su Tiren's Appointment"
 shanxi_advisor_events.10.d: "Su Tiren is a long-time member of Yan Xishan's inner circle, so it was hardly unexpected when he was named as chairman of a series of committees related to the Ten Year plan - most prominently the Economic Reconstruction Committee overseeing village development in the province. Experienced as an educator, legislator and political operator, Su Tiren has taken his mission with his usual calculating stance. He has already drawn up a series of proposals to extract the most he can out of Shanxi's underdeveloped agricultural sector (and others), working diligently to carry out his master's will.\n\nWith an aggressive series of modernisation and centralisation measures, his ambition is to maximise productivity and crack down on the unrest that permeates the province. Although harsh and with a ruthless side, few doubt Su's capabilities and can only hope that the sacrifices he demands will be worth it eventually."

 shanxi_advisor_events.11.t: "Feng Sizhi's Appointment"
 shanxi_advisor_events.11.d: "With political instability abounding, a strong hand is needed to keep insurrection at bay. Commissioner of Police Nan Peilang has seen a greater influx of resources for his efforts, a natural progression of the growth of Shanxi's heavy-handed internal security apparatus. But not all laws can be enforced by gendarmes or a midnight visit by the secret police. And that's why Feng Sizhi has been recently elevated to Minister of the Interior.\n\nThe long-time Chief of the Shanxi People's Political Supervisorial Association, his responsibility often included audits and anti-corruption initiatives. In addition to expanding these efforts, he has also proposed the creation of an internally-focused Shanxi Provincial Intelligence Department independent of the Peace Preservation Bureau. Perhaps stemming from his initial background as an educator, he has also expressed interest in creating more pro-governmental newspapers to buttress the administration of [SHX.GetLeader].\n\nWhatever the case, with Feng Sizhi at the helm of the Interior Ministry, prospective revolutionaries will think twice before creating further instability."
 shanxi_advisor_events.11.a: "Be impartial in law enforcement, and strict in discipline."

 shanxi_advisor_events.12.t: "Bo Yibo's Appointment"
 shanxi_advisor_events.12.d: "Bo Yibo, a young student radical turned socialist activist, is not a conventional choice for a person of influence in [SHX.GetAdjective] politics. However, perhaps in an effort to capture the youthful revolutionary wave present in Shanxi, Bo Yibo has been appointed the latest Head of the Propaganda Department, an organisation first established by Feng Yuxiang at the height of his cooperation with the Kuomintang. Bo Yibo, briefly a member of the Syndicalist Youth League before joining the more established and popular Reorganised Faction of the Kuomintang along with most other student radicals his age, has sworn to his new masters to avoid any behaviour that would damage the image of the government.\n\nStill, his agenda is expected to be quite radical in nature. Aside from the usual functions his department has in disseminating propaganda and creating a consistent ideological programme (usually in hindsight after policies are already implemented), his goal is the formation and expansion of a project known as the \"League of National Salvation through Sacrifice\", a spiritual successor to the Dare-to-Die Corps of the Xinhai revolution. His ability to mobilise people is unquestioned, though it is clear he dreams of much more for his nation."
 shanxi_advisor_events.12.a: "It is only through sacrifice that a nation is saved."

 shanxi_advisor_events.13.d: "Komoto Daisaku, the charismatic and knowledgeable Director of the Tung Chi Mining Company, has steadily won his place within the inner circle of [SHX.GetLeader]. In addition to his technical expertise and his connections with numerous critical experts in various industrial fields, he is also known for his opulent gifts and his ability to draw out funds almost out of thin air for various projects. In particular he has expressed interest in building a rail line connecting Shengyang with [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], something has worried some and drawn the question if he is too good to be true.\n\n[SHX.GetLeader] does not seem too concerned about the insinuations of some of the more xenophobic members of the inner circle, and he has openly floated the proposal of appointing this Japanese-born advisor as Chief Operating Officer of the Northwestern Industrial Company. Such an appointment, likely to be finalised in the coming days, would give an outsider extensive control over a critical state-owned company. Rumours continue to abound with Daisaku, and some are determined to expose him, whatever that means."

 shanxi_advisor_events.14.d: "There are few men that are as dread, or rather should be as dreaded as Sun Chu. The former head of the Shanxi Provincial Gendarmerie, it is an unfortunate fact that he was probably appointed more for his known loyalty to Yan Xishan than genuine technical merit. However, that hardly means he is incompetent, having proven himself quite capable at times in suppressing dissent and enemy infiltration. Although not a particularly gifted military commander, the militarised police force in Shanxi have received marked improvements in equipment in his tenure to aid them in their expanded tasks.\n\nThis has won him control of another portfolio under his growing jurisdiction: Chief of the Peace Preservation Bureau. This newly formed secret police force, designed to provide a more precise scalpel to the Gendarmerie's cleaver, is tasked with both domestic and outside surveillance. Although perhaps there are better men for the position, giving the political realities on the ground Sun will simply have to do."

Our administrators had sought to purchase what were supposed to be brand new trains for our growing railway development, however, the Germans have instead given us locomotives used by their army during the Weltkrieg. Almost all of them have broken down rather quickly after being put into use, and the Germans have been nowhere to be seen.\n\nOur engineers are working to salvage what we can, but if this is how they intend to treat us, we will not be friends for very long."

Our government has paid a very expensive sum of money for what was supposed to be an apparatus that could distil petroleum from coal. However, upon closer inspection, they realised that what we have been sold is little more than a refrigerator and a small boiler connected with a few pipes.\n\nThis, along with many other defective or worthless products, highlights the exploitative nature of our dealings with Europeans.

 shanxi_advisor_events.17.d: "With our increased cooperation, it was only a matter of time before the Japanese showed their hands. Komoto Daisaku arrived in Taiyuan today, introducing himself as the Director of Tung Chi Mining Company. Unlike the boisterous Germans or the contemptuous British, this foreign investor had something different about him. A more sly, discreet way of doing things. No doubt he was extraordinarily friendly - offering lavish gifts that impressed quite a few high-level members of the administration, including [Root.GetLeader] himself. But [Root.GetLeader] was keen enough to realise there was something off.\n\nAs the night went on, the guest of honour discussed his prior experiences as Director of the Southern Manchuria Railway and later director of the Manchurian Coal Mine as well as his experiences as a soldier against the Russians. It was Sun Chu who finally realised what he was avoiding, or perhaps simply waiting to introduce: Daisaku was a long-time Japanese intelligence officer attached to the Kwantung Army. The man simply nodded and said that he looks forward to our continued partnership and the potential rewards it may bring. He has further offered to help advise our government in technical matters, utilising his business experience."

This news comes after a bout of illness connected with Zhao's old age, and no foul play is suspected. A devout Buddhist and a sponsor of Buddhist temples in the province, an extensive ceremony is expected for him before his cremation.\n\nZhao served as a long-time friend, mentor and confidant of Yan Xishan. Born poor, his studious personality gave him the opportunity to study abroad in Japan where he met Yan Xishan and grew enamoured by the ideas of Sun Yat-sen's Tongmenghui. Returning home, he served in numerous positions in Yan's provincial government, including as Secretary General of the Governor's Office, Principal of the Taiyuan Normal School, and even brief forays into military command.\n\nAlthough he has attracted criticisms in the past for his and his family's corruption, little of that was on display today during public remarks by [SHX.GetLeader]. Zhao's own power, which derived most directly from his connection with the Heart Washing Society, has waxed and waned over the years. With his passing though, it appears that the populist right in the [SHX.GetName] have begun to coalesce around Yan's young nephew Liang Huazhi."

If there is any opening, any sign of weakness on our part, he is expected to take it.\n\nNonetheless, we have put efforts in to curry his favour, or at least cultivate a large enough network within the provincial administration to hamstring any overt effort against the central government. If we play our hands right, we can force him onto the negotiating table, or at least delay any movement he makes against us. As Provincial Army troops sweep the highlands near Yulin and Shaanxi, we have put our own forces on watch nearby to prevent any socialist insurgent cells from crossing into our own domain. Although it is perhaps a bit early to celebrate, it is nonetheless clear that we have won a great triumph today."
 shanxi_zhifeng_events.1.a: "Ah, victory!"

 shanxi_zhifeng_events.2.t: "The Shanxi Government Toppled!"
 shanxi_zhifeng_events.2.d: "News came so fast, and went just as quickly. A sudden crescendo of panic, begging us to scramble troops to relieve Taiyuan, and then... nothing. The telegrams simply came to a halt. It appears that \"our\" man in Shanxi province has lost his last bout after decades of rule, facing down his former allies in the Guominjun. Yan Xishan, the once revered \"Model Governor\", was never particularly close to the central government, always suspiciously guarding his autonomy. But he was a pragmatist, and someone we would have had a much easier time coming to an understanding with than Shanxi's new nationalistic masters.\n\nYan's downfall began, in hindsight, with his decision to host the tattered remnants of Feng Yuxiang's rebel army in 1928. Rather than stand aside and allow our forces to wipe out the rogues nesting in the neighbouring highlands in northern Shaanxi, Yan allowed them to fester perhaps out of spite for his own defeat or perhaps out of some misguided belief that he could control them.\n\nPiecing together what happened from the telegrams, reports from our agents, and interviews from hundreds of fleeing elites, it appears that the emboldened Guominjun made a widespread advance from their base area in Yan'an towards Shanxi - sweeping away the armies sent to oppose them. As insurgents began to set up advanced positions around Taiyuan, the desperate provincial government sent frantic requests for reinforcements to relieve the looming siege.\n\nThey were too late, however - before we could mobilise our nearby garrisons, protests and then a palace coup deposed Yan and welcomed the advancing Guominjun main force. Our investments in the province have cratered as Feng actively denounces our authority. Yan's arrogance and unwillingness to inform us of these developments before it was too late are a testament to continuing damage warlordism has done for our country!"
 shanxi_zhifeng_events.2.a: "He can't do that! Shoot him... or something."

 shanxi_zhifeng_events.3.t: "German Mining in East Shanxi"
 shanxi_zhifeng_events.3.d: "It seems that German avarice knows few boundaries. Ever since the end of the 4th Zhili-Fengtian war, Wu Peifu's troops have occupied eastern Shanxi, threatening Taiyuan. Under their protection, German mining companies have set up camp in this valuable province, sucking out our nation's wealth to the benefit of foreigners. With growing controversy over the role of foreign interests brewing among the intellectual class, this rush of German-backed speculation has generated considerable outrage - harkening back to the anti-concessionist student protests of the 1920s.\n\nFor the leadership of Shanxi, it is a bitter reminder of the loss of the eastern part of the province, and they have condemned the Zhili as foreign mercenaries doing the bidding of their German masters. Realising that the rising tensions threaten good business, the Pekin Syndicate has offered on behalf of German interests some monetary compensation to the provincial government. Some however see the sum as paltry, a testament to Western arrogance and the unequal relationship between the Chinese and outsiders."
 shanxi_zhifeng_events.3.a: "We'll reluctantly accept the payout."
 shanxi_zhifeng_events.3.b: "Denounce this foreign concessionism!"

 shanxi_zhifeng_events.4.t: "Last Chance for Peace"
 shanxi_zhifeng_events.4.d.1: "Feng is gone. The Guominjun have been vanquished. Their socialist flunkies flee into the hillsides to an uncertain fate. As Yan and his aides take stock of the purified Shanxi clique, there are no remaining rivals to the Governor's grip on his province. Well, except one.\n\nThe Central Government continues to sit across the border, maintaining its unjust occupation of the wealthy eastern portion of Shanxi province. Our armies are prepared, or at least so we think, to at last emerge from our squalor to secure our rightful place in northern China. Backed by a rebuilt economy, fuelled by the genius of our Ten Year Plan, one powerful strike may very well break the grip of the ailing regime in Beijing.\n\nThat is not to say there is no risk in this strategy. Although our economy hums, the disruption of war threatens to destabilise the system we have built. Moreover, after the numerous promises for peace we have made to legitimise our rule as the \"neutral province\", it is a hard sell to convince our people to once more send their sons to war for the control of the central plains. While they may profess their loyalty now, there is no telling how much fighting the province can take before Shanxi's strength gives out.\n\nWang Xiang and other pro-Beijing elements in the government have offered the alternative - that we seek the peaceful handover of our disputed territories. Although Governor Yan expresses mild annoyance, no doubt expressing suspicion that they have been bought off, they are not wrong that diplomacy might be the best way to secure our goals. Even if that means abandoning Yan's most ambitious dreams of ruling China."
 shanxi_zhifeng_events.4.d.2: "Feng is gone. His Guominjun is gone. Their socialist flunkies are gone. And... the arrogant Central Government that used to lord over us, they are also gone. While we celebrate the elimination of the Zhili tyrants and the fall of the monarchy over the course of the last few years, the reality is the power vacuum that has emerged in their place is troubling.\n\nQuestions race through the mind of [Root.GetLeader], as he and his cabinet wrest with whether or not Shanxi's provincial army will be sufficient to defend against the enemies surrounding us. Perhaps we missed our best chance to strike. Perhaps the Ten Year Plan was not enough. Perhaps we should not have come to blows with Feng.\n\nNo matter. We have no choice but to push forward and ensure that China is freed from the chaos that has gripped the land. Although we may have staked our claim as the \"neutral province\", those days are no more. The Provincial Army must be ready to stand behind the Governor, and the people must be ready to stand behind the Provincial Army. The Shanxi clique will either be free or perish!"

 shanxi_zhifeng_events.5.d: "The Taiyuan-Beijing negotiation event chain is an opportunity for [QIE.GetNameDef] and [SHX.GetNameDef] to utilise the relevant resources they have gathered to influence the final outcome of relations between the province and the central government. If Beijing's influence in Shanxi is high enough and its control over China has not been contested, negotiations may be guaranteed. Shanxi will begin the event chain by selecting their opening offer, with options proportionate to the amount of war support they possess above 50%. Afterwards, both [QIE.GetNameDef] and [SHX.GetNameDef] will have two rounds each to either accept, counter offer, or reject. On the fifth and final round (should negotiations reach that far.), Shanxi will only have the option to accept and reject decisively.\n\nThere are five successful negotiation endings, depending on how successful the respective players have been in pressuring the other to accept. Counter-offers will only be available to the Shanxi player should they have a sufficient amount of war support above 50%, and to the Central Government player should they have influence above 10%. In all five successful outcomes, Shanxi will agree to recognise the central government and will go down the appropriate tree.\n\nThere are three negotiation failure outcomes. If Taiyuan decides to withdraw from negotiations, they will lose 15% of war support, which is a critical resource in future fighting. If Beijing withdraws from negotiations, Shanxi will gain 15% of war support instead. Less relevant is the possibility of [QIE.GetNameDef] collapsing before negotiations end, which will default Taiyuan to the Shanxi Marches On focus tree."

 shanxi_zhifeng_events.5.c: "So be it."

 shanxi_zhifeng_events.6.t: "Taiyuan Takes a Hardline Against Us!"
 shanxi_zhifeng_events.6.d: "Despite our best efforts and all of our help in stabilising their rule, it appears that the Shanxi clique under their perfidious Governor Yan has decided to mobilise against us. He has formally denounced [QIE.GetNameDef] as an illegitimate government, expelling our ambassadors and arresting many of our agents in the area. Businesses aligned with our interests have been seized on the authority of the Governor, and an aggressive propaganda campaign has been waged to rile up the people against us.\n\nPerhaps most worrying, however, is the large army being assembled along the border. Shanxi has long disputed our occupation over East Shanxi, where our presence has limited his authority over the area to just over nominal control. The Shanxi provincial army, which has not seen combat aside from their spat with the Guominjun since the 1920s, is not a terribly impressive force. However, they are equipped with guns and artillery from Taiyuan Arsenal and are expected to try and strike us in the Central Plains when we are at our weakest. With any luck, we will have eliminated other foes before they ever get their chance to lash out, and then show who truly is the rightful government of China."
 shanxi_zhifeng_events.6.a: "There will be no dawn for Yan."

 shanxi_zhifeng_events.7001.t: "An invitation from Beijing"
 shanxi_zhifeng_events.7001.d: "With the Guominjun finally vanquished, Yan Xishan's power has been consolidated in most of Shanxi province and the hills of Yulin. However, one final threat to his power over the region remains: [QIE.GetNameDef]. Our relationship with the Central Government has had its ups and downs, and it was unclear how they had been taking our success in eliminating our final rival in the region. Until now.\n\nApparently no longer able to use divide and conquer to keep us oppressed, the Central Government has decided to extend us an olive branch, offering to meet with our ambassadors and hear our demands for what is necessary to ensure peace across the Central Plains. In doing so, they give us the opportunity to present our case for the return of key contested border territories, staking our claims and potentially creating a fruitful alliance between our factions as China's warlord era nears an end.\n\nOn the other hand, of course, this deal may be proof of Beijing's weakness. It may be preferable to stress to our people the need to resist the tyranny of Beijing, pushing instead for the total liberation of the nation from the illegitimate oppressors. Given that this will likely be our one opportunity for talks, we must consider our options very carefully."

 shanxi_zhifeng_events.7.intro: "With all the troubles that we have faced over the years, with numerous provinces turning to ambitious warlords, foreign powers, ethnic nationalism, or radical ideologies, it has been difficult maintaining the central authority that we are due. So it was a serendipitous sight when today a delegation of \"ambassadors\" sent from Taiyuan arrived today at [QIE.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] with instructions to reach a settlement over \"questions pertaining provincial autonomy\"."

As we scramble to organise a diplomatic team to meet with them, our intelligence officers monitoring the delegation indicate that Governor [SHX.GetLeader] is hoping to secure not merely his continued rule over Shanxi but also major territorial concessions. There is little harm in negotiating, especially since we hold most of the cards in this scenario, however, securing their recognition of our government would be a major victory in protecting our interior. In the meantime, our agents in Taiyuan stand ready to help \"facilitate\" the success of talks."

 shanxi_zhifeng_events.8.intro: "Having been politely, if not necessarily warmly, received by our hosts in [QIE.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], it is important that we get a move on with regard to negotiations. Our leverage comes partially from the legitimacy our recognition provides for the central army, but probably more importantly the assistance our armies can provide in defending [QIE.GetName]. At the very least, an alliance with us will allow them to take troops off the border with us. But aside from the usual demands for autonomy and continued recognition of our provincial rule, the big question of the day is our territorial ambitions.\n\nAt the top of our list is the question of eastern Shanxi, one of the core parts of the province. Ever since our defeat during the Fourth Zhili-Fengtian war, Central Army troops have occupied the area and severely (and often arbitrarily) restricted our decrees from being enforced in the area. In the meantime, the Zhili allowed German companies to exploit the region, particularly its rich coal deposits, while we received hardly any compensation in the meantime. Asking for its immediate return would probably be the easiest thing to achieve."

Having driven the Guominjun out, we now have a steady hold over northern Shaanxi, and it may be wise to make a move for it, perhaps leaving our claims on eastern Shanxi for another time.\n\nOf course, if we feel bold (or simply want to start negotiations high), we could just demand both and see how negotiations go..."

On one hand, we do not want to seem weak, and accepting any terms will require concessions on our part. On the other, national unity is more than a buzzword and securing our flank is essential if we are to avoid overstretching our forces.

In his eyes, they have held up their end of the bargain and proved themselves loyal subjects of [QIE.GetNameDef]. Given that we are likely on the road towards national unification anyway and with our faction ascendant, perhaps there is little to be lost returning this land. On the other hand, Governor Yan has always been a loose cannon. And it's not like there's much he can do about it if we say no."
 shanxi_zhifeng_events.18.d.2: "$shanxi_zhifeng_events.18.intro$\n\nIn the meantime, we authorised on their behalf several lucrative commercial deals with aligned companies, giving us substantiative control over the region's economy. As part of the agreement we signed with Yan to return the province, those deals were to be honoured and payments have largely gone to us with trinket amounts going to Taiyuan's coffers.\n\nNow, with the successful reconquest of the West and the \"numerous noble sacrifices of the sons of Shanxi\", [SHX.GetLeader] has petitioned for the full restoration of their economic rights over the region.

Although not necessarily of the highest quality in terms of training, the army of the [SHX.GetName] retains some of the experience of Guominjun veterans as well as many western-style arms build in the Taiyuan arsenal. Some of their more experienced officer corps can trace their training back to the prestigious Baoding Military Academy.\n\nWe do not have that much time to prepare, so every second counts.

 shanxi_zhifeng_events.21.t: "The [SHX.GetName] Sends Us an Offer"
 shanxi_zhifeng_events.21.d: "Having previously come to blows with us over Suiyuan, it appears that the perfidious [SHX.GetName] has decided to pursue further concessions in the name of \"advancing Chinese unity\". With the Central Government at least nominally behind them, Governor [SHX.GetLeader] has made a very open demand that we join with their newly formed \"Northwest China Political Council\" as a measure to preserve Chinese sovereignty against secessionist groups in the Xibei region.\n\nOf course, this is clearly a front to expand [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]'s influence and subvert our own autonomy, eliminating the freedom our Hui clans have enjoyed for generations. Given their geographic and political closeness however to Beijing, this is not an offer that we can easily brush away. Perhaps joining with them is the best course of action that we can take to ensure our continued influence under an expanded umbrella. On the other hand, Shanxi's practical ability to enforce their will in the steppes is something still up for question, if we should choose war. A third option would be to send an ambassador directly to Beijing to pledge our allegiance, bypassing the need to surrender ourselves to [SHX.GetLeader]."
 shanxi_zhifeng_events.21.a: "We shall submit to Beijing's directives."
 shanxi_zhifeng_events.21.b: "Freedom is not something to be tossed away at will."
 shanxi_zhifeng_events.21.c: "We are loyal to Beijing, not [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]."

 shanxi_zhifeng_events.22.t: "The [XSM.GetName] Submits to the Central Government"
 shanxi_zhifeng_events.22.d.1: "When we first signed an arrangement with [SHX.GetNameDef], many thought this was merely a stalling tactic that would bear little fruit. Even more so when we gently nudged them to go west (leaving us alone in the East). It would appear however that this arrangement has given us an early success, with their recent intimidation of the Hui clans forcing [XSM.GetNameDef] to prostrate themselves before us.\n\nThis decreased autonomy by the Ma clans has greatly expanded our influence in the Northwest and serves as a triumph for [SHX.GetLeader] who has proven himself a useful asset for the central government. Whether or not the adventures of [SHX.GetNameDef] in the Northwest will continue or not remains to be seen, however, it appears that the wily Governor's ambitions are not merely limited to Hui lands."
 shanxi_zhifeng_events.22.d.2: "It appears that we underestimated [XSM.GetLeader] and his political prowess. Rather than submit to our demands to integrate into our planned \"Northwest Chinese Political Council\", they have instead bypassed us and went directly to negotiate with the Central Government for autonomy in exchange for loyalty. There is not much we can really do at this point besides pout, however it does seem like Central Government appreciates our gesture.\n\nWith Xibei at least nominally aligned with us, the rest of the West is now open for further adventures. Whether we have the ambition and courage needed to chase Chinese sovereignty into the rugged hills and flat steppes is another question altogether."
 shanxi_zhifeng_events.22.a: "[SHX.GetNameDefCap] sends us warm regards."
 shanxi_zhifeng_events.22.b: "We have done a valuable service for the nation."

 shanxi_zhifeng_events.23.t: "[XSM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Our Offer"
 shanxi_zhifeng_events.23.d: "The indomitable Hui clans of the Northwest have met to review our offer and have promptly rejected us. Claiming that we have no legitimacy to make the demands that we did, and moreover questioning our own desires over the Xibei region, the Ma leaders have instead mobilised forces to defend against potential invasion. In their quest to protect Hui autonomy and shield themselves from accountability, however, they have instead lost track of the bigger picture: China is but one nation and will not stand for secessionists whether Hui, Mongol, or Tibetan.\n\nIn our hands now is the casus belli we need to march into the vast domain of the Ma clique. Whether or not this is an expedition worth taking is another question altogether."
 shanxi_zhifeng_events.23.a: "Dispatch the army!"

 shanxi_zhifeng_events.24.t: "The End of the Ma Clique"
 shanxi_zhifeng_events.24.d: "Although the Hui clans of the Northwest have long received extensive autonomy in the region, it appears their freedom has come to a final end today with their formal surrender and \"participation\" in the latest project of [SHX.GetLeader]: The Northwest China Political Council. Officially meant to safeguard Chinese interests in the western region by combining the strength of the ascendant Shanxi clique and the ailing Xibei San Ma cliques, in practice the relationship is expected to be dominated by [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].\n\nSome resistance by the Hui is to be expected, however, the council does serve a nationalistic purpose of sorts: keeping an eye on secessionist movements in Mongolia, Tibet and Xinjiang. High-level talks between senior Ma leadership and [SHX.GetLeader] are expected to follow soon, however, whether this new entity can truly prevent the demise of Han-Hui control over the west remains in question. Word has emerged already that any vassal states the Ma did form de jure or de facto have already begun to cut ties."

 shanxi_zhifeng_events.25.t: "The Arrest of Wang Xiang"
 shanxi_zhifeng_events.25.d: "In the dead of night, a squadron of secret policemen quietly made their way to Wang Xiang's lavish mansion in Taiyuan. The Beijing industrialist has long been outspoken in regards to his views and support for the Central Government but to the government of Shanxi, it is clear that he represents nothing more than a foreign threat to the province's interests.\n\nNonetheless, it would appear that the snake had been warned in advance of the impending raid. As the policemen stormed into the estate, they found nothing more than deserted rooms and his servants frantically burning page after page of government documentation and invoices. Local bystanders around his home informed the policemen that Wang Xiang was seen fleeing by car sometime earlier that day - perhaps headed back for his home province of Beijing or seeking exile in another province. Whether the case may be, it is clear that by driving this traitor from our province - we are one step closer to driving the despicable influence of the Central Government on our economy."
 shanxi_zhifeng_events.25.a: "We'll find him eventually."

 shanxi_zhifeng_events.26.t: "The Collapse of [QIE.GetNameDef]"
 shanxi_zhifeng_events.26.d: "With the collapse of the Central Government formally held by [QIE.GetNameDef], a curious political situation has developed on the North China plain. The cities of Beijing and Wuhan are strategic points throughout the country and will no doubt be contested by the various factions that claim the mantle of the Republic of China. While we are jubilant over our recent defeat of the Beijing Government, we must act with haste as it is impertinent that we secure these objectives before the enemy comes knocking on our door.\n\nNonetheless, conservative members of the military staff have advocated for us to instead - bunker down and wait for the rival factions to come to us. Shanxi is naturally defensible and if we take our time to build up our defences, we will surely be whatever for whatever our enemies throw at us."
 shanxi_zhifeng_events.26.a: "The unification of the country is not yet complete!"
 shanxi_zhifeng_events.26.b: "Let's dig in for now."

 shanxi_zhifeng_events.27.t: "The Outbreak of War Disrupts Our Reforms!"
 shanxi_zhifeng_events.27.d: "Although our Ten Year Plan was initially conceived as a means for which to enrich the province and further the power of Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang, after 1936 it has since been retooled to serve as a springboard to militarise the [SHX.GetName] against the enemies of [SHX.GetLeader]. This shift in priorities finally came to a head this week, with the beginning of offensive hostilities outside of provincial borders. The consequences on existing projects have been dire.\n\nAll across Shanxi, budgets for civilian projects have been slashed and non-essential (and some essential) manpower have been conscripted. As the armies of the [SHX.GetName] hurry to storm enemy border posts, an expensive logistic trail has followed that has required the redirection of nearly all civilian traffic. The full attention of the [SHX.GetName] has been turned to war, and the dreams of a peaceful, modern province have been left by the wayside. Whether or not it will ever be picked up again in this generation is unclear."
 shanxi_zhifeng_events.27.a: "Progress will have to wait."

 shanxi_zhifeng_events.28.t: "The Sacrifice Leagues"
 shanxi_zhifeng_events.28.d.1: "In these troubling times, the need for dauntless men to enter the trenches and brave the perils of combat balloons to epic proportions. Seeing little choice, [SHX.GetLeader] has proposed to the mass mobilisation of youths from Shanxi's universities and colleges to help stem the tide of enemy advances. Rallying many to the defence of their guojia, their homeland, is no easy feat, however Yan's brave nephew Liang Huazhi has gone above and beyond in this respect. Hearing stories of Yan's old \"Blood and Iron Society\" he formed with his friends while in Japan, Liang has begun the formation of his own \"Blood and Iron National Salvation Corps\" consisting of many radical nationalist youths striving to end German and Japanese imperialism in the nation.\n\nThey are joined by many other radical militias such as the \"Revenge Corps\" and training in so-called \"People's Revolutionary Universities\", all collectively referred to as the \"Sacrifice Leagues\" whose ranks have swollen since the start of the conflict. Like the Dare-to-Die corps of old, their motivations and backgrounds are diverse - as are their effectiveness. Many parents are not eager to see their young sons go off to combat, or serve as shock troops against enemy fortifications. But at this point, do we have much of a choice?"

 shanxi_zhifeng_events.29.d: "Having successfully beaten back our rivals, we are at last in a position to stake our own claim for national leadership. The start of which begins with the selection of a temporary capital for provisional republic. Such a capital ought to have historic significance as we battle for the hearts and minds of the people, but also be in a strategically important location that will allow us to coordinate logistics for our growing armies. Moreover, it must be protected, because enemy governments will no doubt see such a location as a prime target for a dedicated strike. Based off our present situation, [SHX.GetLeader] decides on..."

 shanxi_zhifeng_events.30.d: "Though many doubted our odds at the start of the conflict, and maybe even [SHX.GetLeader] did not foresee this turn of events, the tide has begun to turn in our favour! Our recent advance has brought us deep into the heart of northern China, raising the exciting possibility of unification under [SHX.GetNameDef]. Spirits are raised like never before, and our officers have taken the initiative to press further and further towards unification.\n\nEvery step we take however, brings us further and further from home. While by this point our armies include men from multiple provinces, the reality of warlord China is that most armies are regionally-based. The Shanxi Army at one point even boasted that all their soldiers were natives of the province, and indeed even the comparatively diverse Guominjun grew rather settled in Shaanxi after nearly a decade. We are strangers then to many, a curiosity for the locals to see and wonder if we will be kinder masters than our predecessors.\n\nMore concerning is the impact our distant campaign is having at home. To field this force, we have drained every resource we could (money, men, labour), and implicit in our victories is the promise that this conflict will be over soon. If we are unable to deliver within a reasonable timeframe, we risk accelerating our collapse. Still, it will be hard to restrain the buoyed spirits of the brave warriors who have set forth from [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], especially when unification seems just one city away..."

On the other hand however, it is necessary that we ensure we do not miss our chances at forming strategic alliances, lest we are outflanked by those who do. Governor Yan Xishan of Shanxi has made his move, offering his hand in friendship in hopes of securing our support in his upcoming war with the [608.owner.GetName].\n\nThe reputation of Yan Xishan is a mixed one. For many years he has relied on the isolation of his province to avoid severe consequences for any foreign policy disasters, aligning at various points with the Anhui, Fengtian, and Zhili cliques. His decision to leave the safety of the mountains likely indicates his preparedness for war but the actual effectiveness of the Shanxi Provincial Army has always been... mixed at the best. Their strongest point is their control of Taiyuan Arsenal, which has given them access to larger quantities of artillery than most."

Known as the \"Traitor General\" by some (one of two nicknames he has), his betrayal of the Zhili clique in 1925 was seen as arch-treason by Wu Peifu and Cao Kun but by some as an idealistic effort to unify the warring factions in the nation. His decision to leave the safety of the mountains likely indicates his preparedness for war but the actual effectiveness of Guominjun is in doubt. Although they were quite famous for their discipline and high morale, it has been some time since they've fought a winning conflict across the central plains, and few could forget their disastrous handling of the western front of the Northern Expedition."

Whether this betrayal was planned in advance or not is unclear, however what is known is that we are effectively on our own. Without their support the [QIE.GetName] has one fewer front to fight on, and are able to concentrate more forces against us.

Sensing the danger he is under, he has scrambled to protect himself - praising the Governor's decision and denouncing our enemies in a desperate show of loyalty. But his position grows more and more embattled by the day, and other factions are just waiting to pounce.\n\nKeeping him on board is not entirely out of the question however. Despite the security risks he poses, removing him may prove difficult depending on how entrenched he is. While his offer to broker a ceasefire seems implausible, after the war he might be of use in swaying the allegiance of the broader merchant class in northern China.

 #Suiyuan Section 1: Ultimatums and Setup
 shanxi_suiyuan_campaign_events.1.t: "Our Interests in Suiyuan"
 shanxi_suiyuan_campaign_events.1.d: "Suiyuan is a province bordering the Shanxi clique to the Northwest, with relatively low population density and with great mineral resources. Only two sections of the Great Wall separate Shanxi from Suiyuan, and during the early days of the Warlord Era, Yan Xishan used the advance of various bandits from the province into Shanxi as a pretext to invade and occupy the region. Officially a special autonomous area under the Beiyang government, Suiyuan was also briefly occupied by advancing Guominjun troops under Feng Yuxiang based out of Shaanxi. Conflict naturally broke out among the two men as they competed for influence over both the Ordos and Ulanqab regions.\n\nThe ambitions of both men for the area, which has a melting pot of Hui, Han, and Mongolian residents, were cut short by the end of the Fourth Zhili-Fengtian war. The Ma clique, rebelling against Feng Yuxiang and the Guominjun after the Northern Expedition, were rewarded with control over all of Suiyuan as part of the final settlement between the Shanxi clique (now a merger of the Yan clique and Feng's Guominjun) and the Central Government. Ma Fuxiang in particular was given the title of Chairman of the Tibetan and Mongol Affairs Commission, a reward for his treachery.\n\nWith the power of [SHX.GetNameDef] back on the rise, our interests in Suiyuan have not decreased. Threatened by the nationalists in [MON.GetNameDef], not to mention the mismanagement of Hui leadership in [XSM.GetNameDef], we must act quickly if we are to recover our treasured territory."

 shanxi_suiyuan_campaign_events.2.t: "Our Path Forward in Suiyuan"
 shanxi_suiyuan_campaign_events.2.d: "The situation in Suiyuan is a complicated one for us. The Xibei Ma cliques, a group of Hui Muslim warlords led by two bickering families, remain masters of Suiyuan. Although they have in the past sworn nominal allegiance to the Central Government in Beijing, they have in practice remained neutral in most conflicts embroiling Eastern/Han China. Nonetheless, they see themselves as Chinese and as the bulwark of Chinese authority over the increasingly rebellious Mongols and Tibetans.\n\nHaving successfully fended off their challengers in the Northwest War against a Buddhist alliance of rebellious states, they are nonetheless severely bloodied from their little adventure. This is at last our chance to get revenge for their stab in the back during the 1920s, and make a play to demand the return of Suiyuan to us. Or else."

 shanxi_suiyuan_campaign_events.3.d: "Despite our triumph over enemy forces in the Northwest war, it appears our troubles are not yet over. Exploiting our losses in the war and hoping for easy territorial gain, the devious [SHX.GetLeader] has sent messengers demanding the immediate return of Suiyuan, a territory that the Ma clique has long governed and is home to many Hui Muslims. They claim that our governance of the area was merely a temporary measure enforced by the Zhili following their victory in 1928, and that it should be promptly returned to its \"proper owners\".\n\nNaturally of course, this is a naked example of imperialism and the arrogance of [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Still, given the circumstances, it might be better to cut our losses and avoid another devastating and violent conflict."

Our armies will soon enter the area, clearing out any resistance from Mongolian or Hui insurgents hoping to force us to withdraw.\n\nWith Suiyuan's return and following a brief period of military occupation, we can now turn our attention towards exploiting the various resources in Suiyuan. Moreover, having avoided a war of our own for the area, we are in substantially better shape to take on other projects in the region."

Moreover, they accuse us of being the traitors in the situation, working against the interests of the Chinese nation by destabilising territory that is rightfully theirs. By contrast, they note that they were the ones that saved Suiyuan from being overrun by Mongolian invaders.\n\nWe in Shanxi take great umbrage to this insult, however it may not necessarily be wise to escalate these matters. Although the Ma Clique has been significantly weakened by the fighting in the Northwest war, the terrain is notoriously difficult to fight on and it will require substantial resources to maintain a campaign that far away from our supply bases. Moreover, the Hui in the area are expected to remain loyal to their Ma overlords and the Mongolians there will likely remain neutral. The question remains whether or not the Ma have called our bluff, or if we have the wherewithal to back our words with lead."

 shanxi_suiyuan_campaign_events.6.d: "Although we had hoped the matter of Suiyuan was settled in 1928 with our recognition of Ma Fuxiang as Governor of both Gansu and Suiyuan (on top of his status as Chairman of the Tibetan and Mongol Affairs Commission), it appears that the Shanxi clique and the Ma clique have once more come to the verge of blows over the valuable border territory. A melting pot of Hui, Han, and Mongol residents, what is likely the true source of contention is its valuable soil suitable for grazing and agriculture as well as major iron deposits.\n\nThe [SHX.GetName] have made their case that they were unjustly stripped of their land in 1928 by their unfair association with the Guominjun as well as the fact that the mismanagement by the Ma clique was a major part in instigating the Northwest war. According to them, the only ones capable of protecting the area from future enemy advance is the comparatively wealthier and stronger [SHX.GetName]. They have also leaned (not so subtly) on our shared Han heritage and our recent rapprochement.\n\nThe Ma representatives, who have rushed to Beijing, protest that they ultimately did win the war for the Northwest, albeit at a great cost, and have been far more loyal to our government than [SHX.GetLeader]. In their words, [SHX.GetLeader] is an opportunist that is swooping in like a vulture to devour those that should be allies.\n\nSome say that we should simply stay out of this matter altogether. Both the Ma and Shanxi clique have been largely unreliable in the past, with the Ma clique siding with the Guominjun and largely staying neutral in contemporary Chinese affairs while the Shanxi clique have sided in the past with Fengtian and the Anhui cliques. Washing our hands of this matter will likely lead to violence, but a violence that will keep both distracted from scheming against us."

 shanxi_suiyuan_campaign_events.7.d.1: "Despite hearing our very gracious appeal, it appears that [QIE.GetNameDef] has nonetheless come out on the side of the [SHX.GetName]. To our tremendous disappointment, they feel that despite the prior treachery of [SHX.GetLeader], he makes for a far more useful ally in the near as well as long term. This is likely due to his ability to furnish a larger army as well as one equipped with artillery produced by Taiyuan Arsenal.\n\nWe are left then with really two choices. Either we yield and hand over Suiyuan or call the Central Government's (and by extension [SHX.GetLeader]'s) bluff. After all, we know the terrain, the Hui are likely to be loyal to us and the Mongols neutral in this inter-Chinese affair, and Beijing has bigger problems to deal with. If we hold our ground, take advantage of our fighting experience and Shanxi's lack of it, as well as Beijing's indifference, we might just be able to keep our land."
 shanxi_suiyuan_campaign_events.7.d.2: "The emissaries of [QIE.GetNameDef] have heard Shanxi's request to return Suiyuan to their control and have decided to side with their new allies in [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], citing our continued disloyalty and inability to defend the valuable province. They have instead decided that [SHX.GetLeader] is the rightful ruler of the province and is to be appointed Pacification Commissioner of Shanxi and Suiyuan effective immediately. Unofficially, they have decided that Shanxi makes for a more valuable ally, seeing our aloofness to Eastern Chinese affairs as no longer a benefit but a detriment to their plans for national unification.\n\nGiven the vast mismatch in strength between us and the Central Government, it appears that we have little choice but to comply with their cruel demand, stripping away a vital province filled with loyal Hui minorities. Especially after our critical service in defending the region from Mongol invasion, one would think that our loyalty to China would be proven.\n\nAppealing this decision is unlikely to yield us significant results without major concessions to our own autonomy, but it is an option. Of course, there is always the emotionally tempting but practically dangerous option of defying Beijing - taking advantage of our knowledge of the terrain and the inexperience of Shanxi Provincial Army troops to win a major upset."

Sending their representatives once more for an appeal, they have brought lavish gifts and other forms of tribute to [QIE.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], paying a very expensive homage to [QIE.GetLeader].\n\nNo doubt they believe that our decision to side with [SHX.GetNameDef] is rooted in their superior resources and proximity to contemporary Chinese politics, and this serves as a means of reassuring us that they are more than capable vassals. They have also assured us that they will act much closer aligned to us, a tacit quid-pro-quo of reduced autonomy should we allow them to retain their beloved \"core\" territories.\n\nThis would mean, however, effectively reversing course and will be seen as a betrayal by [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. There is no telling how they may react, especially given our promises so far. Whatever the case, we need to make our decision carefully."

 shanxi_suiyuan_campaign_events.9.d: "In a stunning betrayal, the leadership of [QIE.GetNameDef] has decided that Suiyuan is to remain with the Ma clique rather than its rightful rulers. They note that the Ma have governed the area for years with success, and that the region is politically dominated by an alliance of Han and Hui that the Ma clique are better able to manage. They have further cautioned us against taking any aggressive action to destabilise Suiyuan, and when we attempted to appeal they had the nerve to chastise us for attempting to humiliate the Ma clans after their heroic defence of the Chinese nation against Russian funded separatists.\n\nGiven the circumstances and the fact that we are locked into an alliance at the moment, it does not seem like there is much we can do but grit our teeth for now and accept it."

 shanxi_suiyuan_campaign_events.10.d: "In a bold display of regionalist arrogance, the Ma clans in the Northwest have rallied together to defy our authority - incensed by our decision to strip them of Suiyuan. In an angry declaration, they have denounced us as betraying the Hui people in favour of Han supremacy, and vowed to never yield an inch of territory. It appears that we have irrevocably damaged ties between ourselves as the Ma, who have long been effectively neutral in Chinese affairs.\n\nSomething needs to be done, the question is what? Given the rugged terrain of the northwest, and the Ma's reputation for being ruthless, vicious horsemen familiar with the land, sending an expedition is dangerous and expensive. It will draw Central Army troops away from where they are needed guarding the valuable regions of China's east.\n\nThe one alternative, as some of our councillors note is to rely on the man whose fault this is. Let the Shanxi clique hand this quagmire they've caused."

Although this gamble is likely to be somewhat risky given the distance between Xibei and the central government heartland, there is a major disparity between the resources of [QIE.GetNameDef] and [XSM.GetNameDef] that even geography cannot account for.\n\nWe cannot afford to lose any more time if we are to take what is rightfully ours. Given the lack of coordination between Beijing and our own Provincial Army, it can be assumed that whatever spoils we gain from this upcoming campaign will be proportionate to what we can secure for ourselves. As we march off to chase the setting sun, we must wonder if our decision to involve the central government paid off or if we've been outplayed."

 shanxi_suiyuan_campaign_events.12.t: "Beijing Gives Us a Free Hand"
 shanxi_suiyuan_campaign_events.12.d.1: "A certain silent, but palpable rage has filled the capital at [QIE.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Word has quickly gotten out, back to our own halls in [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]: the Ma clans are defiant. Rather than simply yield the contested Suiyuan territories, they have instead rallied all the Ma families and other Muslims in China to prepare a defence of their treasured land - daring the Central Government to intervene.\n\nUnfortunately for them, it seems like Beijing has a card up their sleeve. Unfortunately for us, we are that card. Seeing their bluff called, in order to avoid losing face they have decided to sic us onto the rebellious Hui warlords - demanding [SHX.GetLeader] send his provincial armies to bring the Ma back into the fold.\n\nAs a double victory for them, sending us into what may potentially be a draining morass against what is expected to be a ferocious enemy will likely bog down our forces for a considerable amount of time. As we weigh marching off to chase the setting sun, we must wonder if our decision to involve the central government was worth it or if we've been outplayed."
 shanxi_suiyuan_campaign_events.12.d.2: "Rather than take a side in the rising tensions between ourselves and the Ma clique, the Central Government has instead ejected both groups of emissaries and asked that we figure out our own way to maintain the peace. Taking a patronising tone, as if we were small children, they press the need for Chinese unity in face of foreign danger and ask that we do not involve them in our petty squabbles.\n\nIn other words, we are left on our own to secure justice as we see fit. Either we stand down and allow the Ma to get away with their unjust occupation of Suiyuan. Or we chase them into the setting sun and risk a potentially draining conflict for both sides, one that will keep us distracted from participating in Eastern Chinese affairs. Like two clams fighting, the main benefactor is the hungry fisherman, or so they say.\n\nStill, if we are serious about reclaiming what is due to us, this is our opportunity. Beijing has tacitly decided to look the other way, and Suiyuan seems just within reach..."

 shanxi_suiyuan_campaign_events.20.d: "The outcome of the Northwest war, although a disaster for the Chinese people, is nonetheless one that presents an opportunity for us. The victory of Mongolia over the Ma Clique means that a secessionist government now holds Suiyuan, a great insult to both the Han and Hui Chinese inside and outside of the province. Gansu is meanwhile in utter chaos, while the central government is distracted and unable to spare resources to liberate their own countrymen.\n\nEnter us, a fresh force with existing interests in the area. Not only are we able to cast ourselves as the champions of all Chinese people (whether Han or Hui), we are able to exploit Mongolia's relative geopolitical isolation to bait them into a conflict that we will handily win.

Reeling from their devastating defeat in the hands of Mongol and Tibetan forces during the Northwest War, they had little choice but to allow our forces to occupy their remaining lands in Gansu.\n\nHowever, they have continued to resist our efforts to govern the province, which even in passive cases has set back our efforts to restore Chinese order in the area. As one of the major frontier provinces of our nation, it is imperative that we bring this situation back under control. After considerable effort, we have successfully brought most of the powerholders into a meeting in Lanzhou.

Routed on the battlefield by the triumphant Mongolian-Tibetan coalition, the various Hui clans have lost substantiative territories in Qinghai, Suiyuan, and Ningxia. What's left of the old Ma clique's battered armies have fled into Gansu in disgrace.\n\nThe Hui, a predominantly Muslim ethnic group, see themselves as Chinese and are considered an integral part of the Chinese nation.

With a relatively small but diverse population and rich deposits of natural resources, at the surface it is an easy and enticing target. Should we do so, we will have access to large stretches of fertile soil fed by the Yellow River - soil that was able to squeeze Shanxi's own agricultural market back in the 1920s. The iron deposits there are also similarly large, with nearly three times as much iron as Shanxi. To acquire it for ourselves (not to mention demonstrating our superiority over our rivals in the region), would be a great victory for us.\n\nThis temptation should not blind us however from the challenges involved. Suiyuan covers an area of about 329,397 square kilometres, greater than the size of Italy or the Philippines. Although sparsely populated, the locals have already been radicalised by the recent ethnic conflict between Mongols and Hui, and will eagerly help their favoured government.

We could also aim to seize Ningxia, which would focus our attention on the Mongols while potentially giving us an out against the Tibetans.

 shanxi_suiyuan_campaign_events.37.d.Ningxia: "Ningxia has long been a crossroads of sorts where a diverse population of Mongols, Han Chinese, Hui Chinese and others have come into contact at the edge of the borders between nations. War in the area was common throughout history, particularly between the mostly Chinese sedentary farmers and the mostly Mongol pastoralists. The demise of Manchu central authority allowed for violent confrontations between Hui and Mongols that escalated during the Northwest War.\n\n$shanxi_suiyuan_campaign_events.37.closer$"
 shanxi_suiyuan_campaign_events.37.d.Qinghai: "Qinghai has been home to many nomadic groups, including Tibetans, Central Asians, and Chinese clans. Battling for the Silk Road and its valuable trade posts, Chinese and Tibetans have clashed in the area for centuries now. The demise of Manchu central authority allowed for violent confrontations between Hui and Tibetans that escalated during the Northwest War.\n\n$shanxi_suiyuan_campaign_events.37.closer$"
 shanxi_suiyuan_campaign_events.37.d.Gansu: "Gansu, a poor region home to what used to be critical infrastructure along the Silk Road, is home to predominantly Han and Hui Chinese. The collapse of the Xibei San Ma clique and the influx of those fleeing the advances of Mongol and Tibetan forces has already brought considerable disorder in the area. Many are suspicious of outsiders, even the forces from [SHX.GetNameDef] that are supposed to be there to help \"pacify\" the region.\n\nIt certainly does not help then, that raiders from enemy powers have made their way between border posts in Gansu, further stoking up tensions in the area and causing suspicion about the ability for outside forces to help the natives. Escalating violence along the frontier has threatened Chinese authority in the area, and the border grows ever porous. It is clear that in the end this conflict will be decided by war. As the cycle of harm and retaliation continues, the meek and powerless can do little but suffer what they will for the ambitions of uncaring warlords."

 shanxi_suiyuan_campaign_events.41.d: "The fall of our limited authority over the Xibei Region came to a crashing end not too long ago with the Northwest War. This frontier, at the farthest reach of our power, has now been effectively overrun by secessionist Mongolian and Tibetan governments. With our resources limited and a western expedition deemed unwise for now, it appeared at the time that we had little choice but to simply wait for a better opportunity.\n\nThat chance has come today, though perhaps not in the form we necessarily would like. The incorrigible [SHX.GetLeader], in his ever-growing ambitions, has decided to amass his army in hopes of restoring Chinese control over contested regions in Xibei and bringing Mongolia to heel. Perhaps Tibet too. Although we know that his real motivation in all of this is to recover Suiyuan, he has nonetheless created some degree of public enthusiasm across the Chinese world for his crusade, and he has openly asked for our \"blessing\" for his endeavour.\n\nThis might actually work in our favour long term - dealing with a petty tyrant like [SHX.GetLeader], who is Han Chinese, is likely to be easier than one who sees us as a foreign occupier. And, at the very least, hopefully this conflict will keep the armies of [SHX.GetNameDef] busy for a year or so - and out of our hair."

 shanxi_suiyuan_campaign_events.42.d.1: "Despite our pleas for at least verbal support to the Central Government, [QIE.GetNameDef] has only remained publicly silent in face of our growing efforts to recover Chinese land from foreign occupiers. And that is the nicest response we have received. In private, they hiss that they do not trust us to succeed in our expedition, and warn that doing so will only embarrass them further. Moreover, they fear a war with Mongolia will draw the attention of other threats, and insist that we fall on our swords and lose face for the sake of their government.\n\nThis absolute betrayal of the Chinese nation only further underscores how undeserving [QIE.GetLeader] is of his mantle of leadership, and emboldens [SHX.GetLeader] to one day make his own play for that duty. In the meantime, however, we prepare for war all the same. And we will prove them wrong!"
 shanxi_suiyuan_campaign_events.42.d.2: "After a very public showing of our intentions to liberate Chinese peoples from foreign occupation in the Northwest and the rousing of numerous crowds across the nation in support of this endeavour, the Central Government has at last caved and offered their own display of support in favour of our righteous cause. In a ceremony today, they have named [SHX.GetLeader] the \"Pacification Commissioner of Shanxi and Suiyuan\", implicitly supporting our claim over the Northwest.\n\nStill, in private they have been quick to warn us of the dangers ahead. Should we fail, we will not only disgrace ourselves and our army, but also the Chinese people as a whole. China, in their words, cannot afford to be humiliated twice by secessionist powers, and we will not be easily forgiven should we come home defeated. Not by them, nor the people we claim to serve."

Living on the frontiers of Chinese control and far away from central authority, they have build a reputation not only defending their own lands but also assisting the central government in maintaining order in the West. Many itch for a chance to redeem themselves against their old foes, and bringing them into our fold will give as an advantage in the coming war.\n\nOur work with Hui elders has given us an inroad in enlisting the support of their sons and grandsons.

As a result, a summit has been called between the primary warring parties in hopes of finding a satisfactory resolution. Given the present circumstances and many parties' unwillingness to budge, the outcome will probably be similar to the status quo on the battlefield. Contested territories are retained by whoever holds them and the rest are returned to their original owners.\n\nContinuing the war is possible, perhaps for a more favourable deal or simply to avoid losing face, however, it will be costly.

 shanxi_suiyuan_campaign_events.51.d.1: "After each delegation had taken the time to deliberate, a mutually agreed upon ceasefire has been called in Xibei between the warring factions. Although some low-level fighting is expected to occur due to the limited communication infrastructure in China's rugged Northwest region, and many insurgents dissatisfied with the outcome can be expected to continue resisting, by and large the borders will likely remain the same as agreed upon at the conference.\n\nContested territories will remain in the hands of those who occupy them, retaining their hard-won spoils of war. Others will be returned to their original owners, seeing little purpose in continued occupation. It will take time for prisoners to finish being released and for any stragglers believed missing in action to return to their posts. In the meanwhile, the people in the area are mourning the dead and processing the news of the war. With any luck, this will be the final conflict that embroils the region."
 shanxi_suiyuan_campaign_events.51.d.2: "Despite an earnest effort at peace by some parties, ultimately preliminary talks for implementing a ceasefire in the Xibei region have come to nought. Not all delegations felt that the current status quo was acceptable, and decided that they were better off continuing to fight rather than accepting the likely terms that would be achieved in the final peace treaty.\n\nWith representatives from each faction returning home empty-handed, all have little choice but to continue the seemingly senseless killing conflict in China's Northwest. Guns will continue to fire, men will continue to fall, and many wonder if there will even be anything of value by the time the smoke clears. Still, with resources as limited as they are, it is likely this will not be the last opportunity at peace..."

 shanxi_suiyuan_campaign_events.53.d.2: "It is done! Thanks to the courage of our troops, we have achieved some of our goals in the region.

On the other hand, however, for most of our people and theirs, the common desire is to never see another war in their life if they can help it.\n\nAlthough perhaps not everything went as planned, there is little time for regrets or even reflection as we now turn our attention towards administering our conquests. Already, magistrates from [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] flock to the northwest to take inventory of the newly integrated lands while local leaders have begun meeting with our representatives to set the terms of our annexation.

All around, the sectors that formerly came out in support of this campaign, the nationalists in Eastern cities, the Hui clans that had promised their sons for conflict, and the various intellectuals that had lent their support to the rising [SHX.GetLeader], have all turned on him.\n\nWhere there was once respect and even the twinkle admiration across China is now indifference and disgust. To them, the entire army of [SHX.GetNameDef] has been discredited as just another warlord army - able to talk large but always delivering little.\n\n[SHX.GetLeader] has been conspicuously absent in public appearances since the campaign fizzled out, however, in private he has been forced to work a tireless damage control campaign to reassure provincial leaders that his decision to avoid war was necessary to conserve strength for a greater project.\n\nFor his opponents, who had stood their ground in face of [SHX.GetAdjective] aggression and thus prevented any losses without firing a shot (well, save for various skirmishes along the border), this has been a great triumph. The border is expected to cool in the near future as garrisons begin to demobilise and be transferred elsewhere. It seems that peace will prevail after all."
 shanxi_suiyuan_campaign_events.54.d.2: "Despite an extravagant propaganda campaign against the Ma clans and the buildup of troops along the western border, it seems that all these preparations have come to nought after about a year. Various divisions of [SHX.GetNameDef] have been ordered to stand down and withdraw, marking a clear desire to avoid conflict. This has brought considerable reproach to the command staff and the government as a whole, who had staked considerable political capital on this campaign. Already, plenty in [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] have begun mocking in private conversations the impotence of the army. [SHX.GetLeader] too has been the butt of many jokes, with many seeing him as a small dog - all bark and no bite.\n\n[SHX.GetLeader] has been conspicuously absent in public appearances since the campaign fizzled out, however, in private he has been forced to work a tireless damage control campaign to reassure provincial leaders that his decision to avoid war was necessary to conserve strength for a greater project.\n\nFor his opponents, who had stood their ground in face of [SHX.GetAdjective] aggression and thus prevented any losses without firing a shot (well, save for various skirmishes along the border), this has been a great triumph.

 shanxi_suiyuan_campaign_events.55.d: "Now that Suiyuan is in our hands, we can begin the process of establishing a provincial administration. Traditionally governed by a military commander sent to defend the northern frontier against steppe tribesmen, over the last few decades efforts have been made towards civilian administration. These efforts however have been upended by the conflict between Hui and Mongols in the north, and now as a new authority, we effectively have a clean slate to work with.\n\nWhile in theory Suiyuan is to be governed as an independent province, in practice it has always been treated as an extension of Shanxi or Shaanxi. Some have even gone so far as to derisively call it a \"satellite\" of the former. While their autonomy will probably not be much better, it is still possible to govern at least somewhat less harshly.\n\nGuominjun Governors of Suiyuan such as Li Mingzhong, as well as Yan's governors such as Shang Zhen have mostly been military men and were ruthless in their exploitation of the area. Some have called for a softer hand, sending a civilian leader to run the province instead. Prior to our ousting, a few civilian magistrates were groomed for this role like Feng Xi. They have led a Suiyuan provincial council that has existed on paper since 1928 but with no de facto power.\n\nEven more radical minds advise selecting one of the local Hui leaders in the area as a show of good faith to try and win over the various clans living there. Still, we must be wary of making the same mistake as Feng did with Ma Fuxiang, who ultimately betrayed the former once the winds began to change. Who we select will likely dictate how it is run for the near future."

 shanxi_suiyuan_campaign_events.56.d: "Although perhaps beaten down and crushed in battle, the influence of the Mongol princes living in Suiyuan has not decreased. The Mongol princes living in the inner Mongolian region have long complained of abuses by Chinese officials and merchants, who frequently cheated them in deals and have demanded extortionate rates for loans (sometimes 50-70% interest paid in cattle). An influx of Chinese settlers in the area has also caused outrage as [SHX.GetLeader] has openly mulled stripping the princes of what limited powers they possess on the grounds they cannot govern the Chinese effectively.\n\nBanding together with what remaining weapons we have not been able to confiscate and threatening further disruptions in our efforts to extract valuable iron ore for our steel foundries and well as crops to feed our growing economy, the Mongols have formed what they call the \"Inner Mongolian Autonomous Political Council\" and have tried (with little success) at courting outside support. It might be better to come to an accord with these princes quickly, lest the lower classes begin to shift support to them. On the other hand, what was the point in conquering this land if we are too scared to use it?"

 shanxi_suiyuan_campaign_events.57.d: "In Suiyuan, the economy is heavily stratified along ethnic lines. The Mongol peoples there have traditionally made their living by animal husbandry, which requires substantial grazing land. However, the fertile soil has attracted considerable settlement by Chinese groups, who have over the centuries established a sedentary society in the region.\n\nWith our recent acquisition over the region, we have also gained the headache of managing relations between conflicting groups. Unfortunately, the increased settlement (which has been encouraged by our policies and protected by our garrisons) has greatly reduced the grazing area that Mongol clans depend on to feed their animals. Feeling greatly mistreated and seeing their lands ploughed over almost overnight, many have begun to rebel and have launched raids on Chinese farms.\n\nWhile reinforcing our fortifications is an option, the entire region is threatened by continued instability.\n\nA group of nominally aligned Mongol princes called the \"Inner Mongolian Autonomous Political Council\" have offered to mediate the matter, creating a compromise that will give the Mongols the autonomy they seek while keeping the peace. By purchasing land for a \"fair\" (or fair enough) and taking other steps to reassure them (one proposal is to create a bilingual newspaper in Chinese and Mongolian), we might just have the peace we desire yet."

##### Endgame
 shanxi_endgame_events.1.t: "A Rising Power in the North"
 shanxi_endgame_events.1.d: "Not too long ago, the Shanxi Clique was two warlords backed into a mountainous corner, without full control over any one province to themselves, to say nothing of their ambitions in Beiyang politics. Today, the situation could not be more different: victories on the battlefield has made [SHX.GetLeader] more powerful than he has ever been, wielding influence across the Central Plains as discussions turn toward what the unpredictable leader will do next. Some wonder if he will seek align himself with an existing movement, or perhaps he will go on to announce ambitions for national leadership of his own, or maybe he will simply fortify his existing positions while he waits to make his next move.\n\n[SHX.GetLeader] is certainly at the precipice of glory, but that is often a very dangerous position indeed. His well-oiled war machine, fine-tuned by the Ten Year Plan to operate in the Taihang Mountains, has not been able to keep up with the growing demands of conquest. Surging costs for military expenditures simply cannot be met by the over-taxed Shanxi-Shaanxi population, and overwhelmed civil authorities have struggled to make up the shortfall. Officers, with varying degrees of sanction, have resorted to looting and extortion to pay their men which has soured many to the prospect of a [SHX.GetRulingParty] victory.\n\nThe army too is in much poorer shape than how it departed home. Casualties and desertion have thinned the army's ranks, and snarled logistics have made replacing lost soldiers with trustworthy men from home considerably more difficult. In the chaos of war, defeated warlord armies have often simply switched sides wholescale, weaking the once tight bonds between our forces. As the quality of the composition of our troops declined, so has morale and the ability for our high command to control them.\n\nWith fighting still underway and further conflict looming in the horizon, this is a poor time to be encumbered with such challenges. How short-lived will our stroke of fortune be shall be determined by how quickly we can get our affairs in order."

In practice, these parties have had little power in their own right, something that will likely remain the same for the near future. Still, in this new China, surely there is some room for political negotiation and power sharing.\n\nThe Convention seeks to test the waters of Chinese democracy by representing a variety of political parties in a country divided for the past three decades.

 shanxi_endgame_events.8.d: "The republic formed by [SHX.GetLeader] is dominated by the traditional northern factions that have existed in some form or another since the Beiyang Republic. The Beiyang political establishment's understanding of political parties differ from Western liberal traditions, treated more as elite social clubs than vehicles for ideological changes. Front organisations like the Harmony Association and Recovery League dominated Zhili and Fengtian rubber stamp legislatures, and accordingly both have since broken up. The majority of their former membership have either joined the [SHX.GetRulingParty] or found new patronage within other strongman camps.\n\nIn the power vacuum that emerged, the CERA nearly suffered a similar fate, and their leader Xu Qin retired in poor health. Young guard figures like Wu Xianzi and Li Daming have rebranded their fractured coalition the \"Democratic Constitutionalist Party\", claiming successorship to the CERA, the big-tent Progressive Party, and the legacy of Liang Qichao.\n\nOther legislators have coalesced around the \"Recovery Party,\" a merger of the moribund Recovery League (successors of the Anhui clique), their rivals in the Communications Clique and smaller industrial interest groups like the Prosperity League. Led by one-time Premier Liang Shiyi, they have found their niche pressing for fiscal responsibility and economic stability.\n\nNot everyone has decided to join a party and in one particularly idealistic corner of the assembly is Hu Shih, proud of his status as an independent and his New Culture Movement convictions. A determined man, he is willing to buck the wishes of even the President, to the astonishment (and admiration) of many.\n\nWinning some friends in the northern establishment is critical for the continued good function of our republic. [SHX.GetLeader] is a military man by education, and in this early honeymoon phase many civilian intellectuals seek to court his favour. While it is too early to make any firm commitments, it would be wise to start a dialogue..."

 shanxi_endgame_events.9.t: "The Southern Republicans Rally"
 shanxi_endgame_events.9.d: "Although the new republic has been dominated by flashy northern personalities, there continues to be a massive republican base in the southern part of the country. Home to many well-oiled political machines, Southern political parties are well accustomed to stirring up the masses for their leader's benefit, and it was there that various anti-monarchist and revolutionary groups were born such as the National Protection Alliance against Yuan Shikai, the Federalist movement led by Chen Jiongming, and the Kuomintang of Sun Yat-sen. Behind them were dozens of smaller factions, including many genuine believers in democracy and societal reform. It is these men who now take the lead, emerging from the ashes of the defeated.\n\nHoping to navigate the waters of this new government and tread a \"third path\" between socialist or nationalist extremism and military rule, the \"Federation of Chinese Democratic Parties\" has been mustered under the leadership of Zhang Junmai alongside many others. Political idealists, scholars, and intellectuals, the coalition of various smaller parties and interest groups is more of a product of their inability to achieve prominence otherwise rather than of any politically savvy move.\n\nStill, they have achieved good international press because of their democratic leanings and support for principles such as constitutionalism, separation of powers, and human rights. They have also absorbed much of the remaining federalists under their banner, giving their alliance a particular niche in elections, though the FCDP remains unwieldy and big-tented with utopian but divided goals.\n\nThey are opposed by many in the North, suspicious of their intentions and embittered by lingering animosity from decades of conflict. Many associate the south with political chaos, extremism, and regionalism, the roots of warlordism. The FCDP's fate as a genuine vessel of republicanism or just a front for southern political machines will likely depend on early and effective patronage under someone far more realistic than Zhang."

 shanxi_endgame_events.10.t: "The Young China Party Radicalises"
 shanxi_endgame_events.10.d: "Although for the longest time marketing themselves as a relatively moderate nationalist and anti-warlord party, inspired by the Young Turks and against the corruption of the Zhili clique, the changing circumstances they find themselves in has seen them turn towards their more radical ambitions to distinguish themselves from their competitors. The very real possibility that [SHX.GetLeader] would favour them in a way that their prior patrons have not has encouraged them to double down on their beliefs, energetically courting the new President and his advisors. Having come to power with little institutional support or a dedicated political party, the YCP hopes to fill that void in [SHX.GetLeader]'s regime, acting as his primary vehicle for political control.\n\nThe Young China Party's plans for the recently united China is nothing short of thorough. Taking inspiration from foreign ideologies and with plenty of time to ponder, the intellectual wing of the YCP has adopted a Darwinian mentality when it comes to the realm of nations. If China is to survive into the second half of this century, it must begin a programme of mass modernisation and industrialisation. Their platform is fiercely nationalistic and anti-imperialist, seeking aggressive measures in securing the end of concessions or foreign influence. This extends to cracking down on secessionist or regionalist movements and their promotion of Han chauvinism has worried many who fear further instability. But perhaps most worrisome for this fledgling republic is their desire for national unity at any cost, demanding mass ideological indoctrination and the effective implementation of a one-party state, built around what will effectively become a cult of personality behind [SHX.GetLeader].\n\nIn sum, they have clearly thought up a comprehensive slate of programmes for China, which when implemented might very well be monumental in scope. Left unsaid is their expectation of exclusivity, and in any case other parties we have begun discussions will likely distance themselves should we align with the YCP. But unlike the more moderate parties they offer a degree of ideological unity, and might [SHX.GetLeader] be tempted by such absolute power?"

 shanxi_endgame_events.11.d.1: "The Chinese Nationalist Party traces its origins to Sun Yat-sen's Tongmenghui and the Nationalist Party of 1912. When Sun was driven off the political stage by the Beiyang warlords, he reformed the Chinese Kuomintang (Nationalist Party) in Shanghai on October 10, 1919. The party champions Chinese nationalism and adheres to Sun's Three Principles of the People (Minzu, Minquan, and Minsheng - Nationalism, People's Governance, and the People's Livelihood, respectively).\n\nThe Nationalist Party attempted to overthrow the Zhili Clique in 1925 with the Northern Expedition based out of Guangzhou. Their failure in that expedition forced the Chinese Kuomintang to flee overseas or participate in the Jiangxi-Fujian Insurgent Zone. Despite being known as a \"big tent party,\" the Kuomintang has taken a decidedly leftist direction with many of its leaders professing to the ideas of socialism and Chinese nationalism.\n\nAlthough their latest effort at revolution has ended in failure, some of their party have nonetheless begun organising anew in our republic. Although Yan is not fond of socialists, their ideas of state capitalism and aggressive industrialisation are tempting, not to mention their mass appeal. On the other hand however, any agreement we sign with them will likely force other parties we have previously negotiated with to break off talks and push us ever closer to the \"anarchy\" that Yan Xishan has spent his life trying to fight. But is not the point of a new China to be revolutionary?"

To many leaders within our movement, the Kuomintang is merely a southern comrade in the national revolution.\n\nMaking such an alliance work however in this new republic will require more than a common admiration for Dr. Sun or pleasant words. The Kuomintang leadership expect the implementation of rather socialistic policies and moreover the establishment of a party-state before eventual democratisation, both of which will effectively exclude any other groups we have sought to ally with.

 shanxi_endgame_events.12.t: "The Legacy of Warlordism"
 shanxi_endgame_events.12.intro: "Although China is at last unified and a somewhat stable democracy has been established, the bitter-sweet reality is for all the progress China has made it will take at least a generation for the people to recover. The land remains devastated in many areas, decades of potential economic growth have been lost, and many have lost loved ones in the various wars and conflicts along the way. The political system in many areas remains dominated by ex-warlords and their associates, and nepotism remains commonplace. Corruption is difficult to root out, and many (even commoners) are resistant to change. Many ex-warlords join political parties to protect their legitimacy, and even some of the more idealistic factions are guilty of allowing them in, blurring the lines of licitness."
 shanxi_endgame_events.12.midpoint: "On the other end of the political spectrum plenty of those disillusioned with the outcome of Chinese unification turn towards the fringes.

 shanxi_endgame_events.14.t: "Ten Immediate Aims"
 shanxi_endgame_events.14.d: "In an inaugural speech today, President Feng Yuxiang outlined an series of rapid reforms for the nation to be executed immediately. These \"Ten Immediate Aims\" were widely disseminated in written statements by [SHX.GetName] state-backed media.\n\n1. To aid those people who had suffered from the war, and to prevent anyone's losing his home.\n2. To order the national finances and tax structure, and to eliminate oppressive taxation.\n3. To register the population as a means of preventing banditry.\n4. To maintain order among regional patrol forces until they could be reorganised.\n5. To investigate and arrest corrupt officials and other undesirable elements in order to provide the people with tranquil conditions.\n6. To establish factories where the unemployed could find work.\n7. To put roads and irrigation facilities in good order.\n8. To institute free education.\n9. To abolish opium smoking, gambling, and prostitution.\n10. To enforce rules against wearing queues and foot-binding, in order to eliminate these customs.\n\nThose who have been a part of Feng's movement since the beginning might have noticed that these objectives are nigh identical to the ones he issued in Kaifeng back in 1922, though for most the President's words capture a hopeful optimism for the future. Indeed, pursuant of objective two, Feng has ordered the confiscation of much of the wealth of former opposing warlords - particuarly those who have fled abroad. Although many assets have been stashed in foreign banks, their mansions have been taken and a great deal of treasure has been reported as seized. If Feng intended to make a statement, his message is certainly getting across."

 shanxi_endgame_events.15.t: "The First Family"
 shanxi_endgame_events.15.d: "The first months of Yan Xishan's administration across a united China have sparked a flurry of activity in the national capital. A surge of bureaucrats and others hoping to seek new positions in the government has brought large numbers of people to [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], perhaps most evident by the constructions of dozens of new mansions near the Presidential Palace.\n\nYan Xishan's own family has begun moving in. His wife, Xu Zhuqing was unable to bear children so Yan's parents instructed him to take on a concubine Xu Lansen (a common practice in 1903). To avoid conflict, both women were required to be considered sisters, and Xu Zhuqing was to be considered the mother of Xu Lansen's five children.\n\nYan's household has suffered considerable tragedy over the last few years during his struggle to liberate China. Poor medical conditions and plague meant his first and third sons (Yan Zhigong and Zhixin) died in infancy in the early warlord era. Both of his wives have also since died, leaving Yan's dedicated cousin Yan Huiqing to take care of his daily needs (on top of being Chairwoman of the Women's Association).\n\nWith his children born relatively late (Yan was in his forties), he arranged marriages for them at an early age. Yan Zhikuan (the second eldest born in 1919) has died of severe epilepsy, just after having two children. Yan's other two sons, Yan Zhimin (born 1926) and Yan Zhihui (born 1927) are extremely young, posing some concern for Yan's future succession.\n\nRestless despite his hectic schedule and often stressed about not only matters of succession but the general future of his young republic, Yan Xishan frequently frets about the progress of his reforms. He fears the anarchy that will overtake the nation without his wisdom. In his few quiet moments, he dreams of writing down his many thoughts, perhaps when he isn't so busy. Titles like \"The Error of Syndicalism\", \"The Impending World Crisis\", \"Peace or World War\", \"The Road to Cosmopolitanism\", \"How to Impede War and Establish the Foundation of World Peace\". Odds are, he will die in his job, but an old man can still dream."

 shanxi_endgame_events.16.t: "A National Vice"
 shanxi_endgame_events.16.intro: "As the budding Chinese healthcare system is slowly finding its form in a recent stabilised [SHX.GetName], its leadership turns to addressing one of the primary public health challenges plaguing the nation: opium. Over a generation after the end of the Opium Wars, large segments of the population find themselves addicted to the vice and its elimination has become a national rally cry. Creating meaningful solutions however has always been a challenge, often sabotaged by the very people who claim to want to end it."
 shanxi_endgame_events.16.d.yan: "$shanxi_endgame_events.16.intro$\n\nYan Xishan knows all too well how difficult it is to eliminate opium even on a small scale. In 1916 nearly 10% of Shanxi were addicts, causing severe poverty and moral decay. The Society for the Suppression of Opium Smoking was tasked in rooting out the problem, arresting dealers and seizing cargo to price out addicts.\n\nYan brutally fined them, humiliating, and imprisoned addicts, often in work camps where they died of withdrawl. But unable to sustain the prison population and drawing public ire, he switched tracks to rehabilitation - using sanitariums and gradual weaning of drugs instead.\n\nInitially successful in reducing addiction by 80%, the soaring prices meant enterprising opium merchants found a lucrative market in Shanxi, sometimes escorted by warlord troops of neighbouring provinces. In the end, Yan caved and tried creating a government monopoly on the drug, ostensibly selling \"medicine\" to cure addiction. Magistrates were given hundreds of kilos of such \"medicine\" to sell (losing their jobs if they failed), though ultimately Yan was outcompeted even in this regard by an influx of foreign \"pills of immortality\" (a mix of heroin and morphine)."
 shanxi_endgame_events.16.d.feng: "$shanxi_endgame_events.16.intro$\n\nFor Feng Yuxiang, this problem is a very personal one - his impoverished parents were both addicts and wasted away what little money they had on the drug. Feng has made it is quest to seek its elimination, and like many see opium as emblematic of China's descent into moral (and practical) corruption. Fighting addiction also takes a nationalistic bent: Questions 18 and 19 of the Guominjun catechism blames the start of foreign \"browbeating\" on the English's \"forcible introduction of opium into the country\".\n\nIn his career, Feng Yuxiang has often ordered the total ban of opium, arresting dealers and establishing expert-run sanitariums as a progressive means of curing the problem.\n\nStill, this has not always been successful, thorough or even implemented for long. The wealthy were given lax treatment, with the focus primarily being on giving poor addicts a trade. Feng often found himself tapping into the lucrative taxation of the opium trade, and like other warlords sometimes the Opium Suppression Bureaus were used to help raise money for the cash-strapped army."

 shanxi_endgame_events.17.d: "In an interesting development, Yan Xishan in his time in office has taken a somewhat utopian turn. Perhaps realising his weakness in mobilising the masses, or in an effort to capture the imagination of the general public, or maybe out of some lingering idealism from 1911, Yan Xishan has published a series of short pamphlets outlining his plan for world harmony and in particular stressing his idea of a \"cosmopolitan economy\". In it, he has written down three principles consistent with such a system:\n\n1. The fruit of one's labour should be wholly given to the labourer for his contribution. It should not be exploited by any method or system.\n2. The labourer should be provided with ample opportunity for employment, without it he will have no chance of sustaining his livelihood.\n3. The effectiveness of labour must be increased so his standard of living may increase as well.\n\nUndoubtably proud of his insight, an outgrowth of his prior work in Shanxi province and his Philosophy of China, he has boasted that he has found the middle solution between socialist radicalism and capitalist exploitation. He has gone so far as to order his pamphlets published in foreign languages, with the hopes of disseminating it abroad to strengthen his image as an enlightened ruler."

His second wife, having married him a year after the death of his first one in 1923, she was an early revolutionary activist and participated in various feminist, anti-imperialist, and educational causes prior to meeting him. Educated at a Methodist women's college, she also worked as a pastor's assistant at a Congregational church. She also periodically served as a professor at Beijing, helping chair the nursing department at Beijing Normal University.\n\nAs a first lady, she has eagerly and actively worked to compliment Feng's efforts in promoting his rule as one for the people. She has tirelessly made public appearances and sponsored multiple charities alongside other prominent women in the new republic. These include the War-time Children Fostering Commission, Red Cross Society of China, and most recently she has co-founded the All-China Democratic Women's Federation along with Song Qingling.\n\nLike many other women in China's changing society, she has taken an active role in shaping the nation's future. Alongside her husband and sometimes independent of him, she takes on the spotlight, making her mark on China's history."

 shanxi_endgame_events.19.t: "Towards Non-Alignment"
 shanxi_endgame_events.19.d: "Perhaps it was due to years spent relative isolation from the rest of China. Or perhaps it was having witnessed years of war throughout the North Chinese Plain, the mobilisation of the Shanxi people when it came to national reunification or the greater mobilisation of the nation during the Second-Sino-Japanese War.\n\nCritics and observers have described how these incidents and experiences in Yan Xishan's life have major influences on the new President's foreign policy. Indeed, Yan has written extensively on the role of China as a mediator in Asian-Pacific affairs rather than an aggressor. In one of his new pamphlets, \"How to Impede War and Establish the Foundation of World Peace\", he envisions China not just as an economic powerhouse within the greater continent of Asia but one that strives for peace rather than the devastation and chaos of war. United hand in hand, the once oppressed and colonial subjects of the Asian continent shall rise - under the economic leadership of the Chinese, who themselves have freed themselves from their chains.\n\nToday, in [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], President Yan announced the creation of the Asia-Pacific Non-Aligned Movement to further such goals. Dignitaries and ambassadors from countries around the globe witnessed this extraordinary declaration as China finds herself on the world stage."

 shanxi_endgame_events.20.d: "Having reunified China under the banner of the Guominjun, Feng Yuxiang now has no opponents to rival his claims to the leadership of the National Revolution. As many are aware, it is not merely the Chinese Kuomintang who preached the idea of national revolution - Feng sees in his movement and his cause the true successor to the ideals of Dr. Sun Yat-sen.\n\nPerhaps seeing himself as the natural heir to Dr. Sun's revolution, Feng has declared that the Chinese Revolution henceforth shall be more than a revolution for China - it shall be a greater revolution for the oppressed peoples across Asia. The Guominjun is no longer to be merely a Northwest Army or a People's Army but rather a force for all those who yearn for national liberation. According to Feng, this is the natural course of the National Revolution.\n\nShocking reactionary ambassadors, dignitaries, and observers in his capital city of [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], President Feng Yuxiang announced the creation of the \"National Liberation Front\" - to provide salvation for all those who yearn for it. Having unified China by force of arms and fighting the Japanese to surrender in the Second Sino-Japanese War, Feng has earned a global reputation as a formidable military leader with an equally disciplined and elite army. A new China has been awakened, and the world will only have to wait and see what China will do now that she has returned to the world stage."

 shanxi_endgame_events.21.d: "To some, he has always been a loyal patriot of the Chinese Revolution since he attempted to assassinate the Xuantong Emperor's father. To others, he is the true heir to Dr. Sun's revolution - having led the Kuomintang into exile in Europe before returning to lead the Nanjing Nationalist Government. But despite his credentials, Wang Jingwei's reputation is undoubtedly mixed in the new Chinese Republic due to the Kuomintang's second failure in attempting to reunify the country, with many viewing his relationship with the Third Internationale with scrutiny.\n\nNonetheless, he is certainly a dynamic speaker and a member of the Kuomintang's old guard, having even written Dr. Sun's will. President Feng Yuxiang has graciously welcomed Wang into his new government, although he has quickly appointed Wang to the formal position of ambassador to [FRA.GetNameDef]. There are suspicions that Feng simply wishes to co-opt the Kuomintang's legacy by welcoming Wang and the Kuomintang remnants into the new Republic or that he wishes to keep Wang on a tight leash. Regardless, Wang now finds himself in a position of bitter irony - as he is back where he started."

 shanxi_endgame_events.22.d: "Sponsored by Zhang Zhijiang, a retired commander in the Guominjun who has repeatedly appealed to the new Ministry of Education for funding, the former \"Nanjing Central Martial Arts Research Centre\" has received extensive renovation under Zhang. Working with his long-time friend Ma Fengtu, they have begun hosting classes for teaching traditional Chinese martial arts. Although some in the ministry opposed this move, seeing Wushu/Kungfu as out-dated, ultimately Zhang won over many of his old colleagues who share his appreciation of martial prowess.\n\nPrivately run though with extensive government support, different styles of boxing, sports, and youth education programmes are being offered. Other, more intense activities such as swordplay, knive usage, whips, sticks, and guns are also taught, though rumours of poor safety standards and blood spatter has drawn criticism. Some wonder if the ex-military staff are dangerously failing to draw a distinction between sport and war.\n\nStill, Zhang continues to discuss his big plans for the future. A three part National Martial Arts Examination will likely be offered next year, testing physical endurance, martial arts skill, and an oral test about the Three Principles of the People. Feng Yuxiang for his part seems to be supportive, even asking this new academy to train a Wushu team for the next Summer Olympics."

 shanxi_endgame_events.23.d: "Through all the turmoil and destruction of the Warlord Era, it was often difficult to preserve the heritage of the Chinese nation. Many sites fell into disrepair, cultural values began to fray, and traditions forgotten as the deathtoll rose. As part of his commitment to protecting the nation's culture (and perhaps to assert himself as a protector of traditional values), Yan Xishan's new government has begun allocating funds to protect Chinese cultural sites.\n\nOne particularly special choice was the Yungang Grottoes in his own home province of Shanxi, a Buddhist shrine built by the Northern Wei near Datong between the fourth and fifth century. With Buddhist statues carved in over four dozen caves, some seventeen metres high and some only two centimetres tall, the grottoes are an impressive piece of Chinese history. Exposed as they are to the open air, however, they have been partially damaged by industrial pollution from the Ten Year Plan.\n\nSince the beginning, the Yungang Grottoes were built and sponsored by the Imperial court, with successive dynasties working at various points to preserve them. With China under a new master in a new age, it seems the modern rulers are little different in their appreciation of such an awe-inspiring work of art."

 shanxi_endgame_events.24.d: "Having recently declared a republic, [SHX.GetLeader] has been hard at work in building a government in his vision. But for all his rhetoric of a new China, he is hardly building it from scratch. Instead, in many ways the new China emerges from the husk of the old, modelled after and built on the foundations of Beiyang.\n\nPardons have been granted to various figures from defeated factions, strategically of course. While quite a few big names have been welcomed into the new government, astute observers note that missing from the list are anyone with a military powerbase of their own. A few particularly prominent ones such as Hu Shih and [CHI.GetLeader] gave some pause, but [SHX.GetLeader] is insistent that they be there.\n\nAll that's left now are a few remaining \"maybes\" on the list. None are nationally prominent, but have enough local sway one way or another to be a potential risk. As [SHX.GetLeader] personally reviews these names with his staff, he decides his approach."

Step by step, the party-state envisioned by Sun Yat-sen is being built, with the Guominjun taking the lead in implementing the political tutelage, national reconstruction, and the Three Principles of the People. The Kuomintang has taken a more junior role in the process, though thanks to Feng's patronage their formerly flagging numbers have been revived.\n\nAs the Dang-Guo (Party-State) dawns on the nation, the President mulls whether there really is much of a point in keeping the National Revolutionary Party and the Nationalist Party separate. Feng already incorporated the Three Principles into his rhetoric long ago and although there might be some resistance from the Kuomintang old guard, ultimately there is no one standing in his way of claiming the coveted title of heir to Dr. Sun. Doing so would markedly shift perceptions of his regime leftwards, which may alter his international standing as well. On the other hand, it would require sacrificing his treasured flexibility, forcing him into an effectively exclusive alliance with the socialists."

 shanxi_endgame_events.26.t: "The Promising Career of Deng Xiaoping"
 shanxi_endgame_events.26.d: "With a career spanning multiple continents, the young Chinese military officer from Shanxi province, Deng Xiaoping, represents the new generation of Chinese politicians and intellectuals of the new 20th century who are influenced by the successful syndicalist revolutions of both France and Britain. After studying abroad with various Kuomintang branches across Europe, Deng returned to China in January of 1926 where he served as a political instructor at the Zhongshan Military School.\n\nSince Feng's subsequent retreat and then resurrected Guominjun movement in Shanxi, Deng has achieved a notable presence within Feng's growing political sphere that is seeking to accommodate greater political participation from the other revolutionary parties in China, such as the Chinese Kuomintang and the Chinese Syndicalist Party. As a result, he has accepted a gracious post to the government granted by Marshal Feng as the formal head of the Republic of China's Ministry of Finance.\n\nWith his experiences in Europe, Deng's dynamic novel approach to resolving China's economic woes and spurring modernisation and growth, is his vision of a centrally planned economy in a similar manner to the syndicalist nations of Europe, while also promoting the activities of the free market. The goal of Deng's plan is to create a semi-balance between capitalism and socialism in order to generate capital and encourage industrialisation. The national government would still have public ownership of land, banks, raw materials, and strategic central industries so that a democratically elected government can decide on how to allocate and utilise such resoureces; but private ownership would still be allowed of finished products and services. To Deng and the nominally socialist government of Feng Yuxiang's National Revolutionary Party, these reforms are in accordance with Marxist principles and will thereby drive China into a true socialist state in accordance with the socioeconomic conditions of the country."

 shanxi_endgame_events.27.d: "Yan Xishan has always been a man on the move, someone who has never hesitated to act when it comes to modernising Shanxi and now modernising China. The Young China Party have similarly always been keen on progress and they have searched far and wide for a strong leader who could enact their agenda. It is no wonder that they have been so quick to form a symbiotic relationship; though the Young China Party has sought the sponsorship of figures such as Wu Peifu, Sun Chuanfang, Yuan Zuming, and Zhang Zuolin, few can quite compare to the \"Model Governor\" of Shanxi. Likewise, Yan Xishan has craved a vehicle for harnessing the masses, a party that can mobilise the people to support their leader.\n\nTogether they have created a Party-State, a powerful integration of party, government, and army all under Yan Xishan's purview. And yet, Yan Xishan has  thus far refrained from joining the YCP itself, despite offers (of varying degrees of sincerity) to allow him to be their Chairman. This has kept the YCP nominally out of the Presidential Mansion, though at this point some may debate the wisdom of doing so. Perhaps Yan is afraid their demagoguery will ultimately reflect badly on him, or maybe he does not wish to be in their debt. Yan has always been suspicious of political parties and mass movements, but maybe that is because he has not found the right one yet. Regardless, the opportunity has presented itself: one final step in creating a new China."

 shanxi_endgame_events.100.d: "Following our successes on the battlefield, the former army of Shanxi has swelled beyond its greatest imaginations with new recruits and deserters from the former armies that we have bested. This poses a new problem for the newly established Zhongyuan Government as now the army is too large to manage for what was once merely a Provincial force. The General Staff has proposed to [SHX.GetLeader], that there are two ways in which an army reform can be undertaken to reorganise the military forces.\n\nThe first is to merely embrace the existing institutions and divisions of existing warlord armies and to champion the notion of regional armies. This will make it easier to draw upon men in times of war although it leaves the professionalism and training of our troops much to be desired. Having men tied to specific regions will make them hardier fighters in local terrain, but we will have challenges bringing our numbers to bear abroad.\n\nThe second is to reorganise the army fully into a New Central Army, retiring those who have little to no military experience and instead to focus on a unified centralised structure with a highly disciplined army corps. Our aim to create an modern army, the best in China, capable of carrying out the orders of its commanders effectively both at home and overseas."

 shanxi_endgame_events.101.d: "With our reorganisation programme having been chosen, our new — now governmental - military force is intended to represent the whole of the Chinese nation. Yet it is ultimately lacking in the expansive military staff and high command compared to previous Central Administrations, who were flooded with capable and willing minds to lead China's armies. Therefore, the current General Staff has petitioned [SHX.GetLeader] for an executive order of amnesty for some of the fresher, less attached, generals of the previous Central Government.\n\nWith the order announced and granted, a duo of daring commanders have offered their services towards the Zhongyuan Government, having only relatively recently received their own commissions with the previous Central Government, their are relatively politically aloof, focused only on their duty and service. With both Guo Jijiao and Wang Lingyun being bright young minds capable for commanding modern armies, the hope is that they will be the torchbearers of the new Chinese military."

 SHX_strict_neutrality: "Strict Neutrality"
 SHX_strict_neutrality_desc: "Surrounded by high mountains and tense neighbours, the leadership of Shanxi has fallen into a deep political and diplomatic isolationism. This perpetual siege mentality has ironically given Shanxi's leadership some peace of mind from Zhili encroachment, but their regionalist messaging has left their people apathetic to any foreign interventionism. If Yan and Feng have any dreams of leaving Taiyuan, then a consistent vision is necessary to rally the people."

 SHX_strict_neutrality1: "Fading Neutrality"
 SHX_strict_neutrality1_desc: "Despite the high mountains and a deep-rooted sense of provincialism, the leadership of Shanxi have begun to climb out of their inward-facing isolation. Once again looking outwards, it is clear that the [SHX.GetRulingParty] still dreams of uniting China and sharing its vision with others. The people too, from the gentry to the intellectuals to even the humble laobaixing appear to share this growing sentiment. Many obstacles remain and Shanxi would be an underdog in any conflict, but maybe Shanxi won't be isolated forever."

 SHX_Ten_Year_Plan_begins: "Reinvigorated Ten Year Plan"
 SHX_Ten_Year_Plan_begins_desc: "Change is in the air in Shanxi. Although the laobaixing don't know or don't care about the petty politics between Shanxi's strongmen, even they can feel it too. Village headsmen working instead of gambling at night, activists and propagandists buzzing around at greater frequencies, and magistrates from Taiyuan actually worrying about generating genuine numbers. Even outsiders have taken notice - investors from Beijing and observers from outside the country have made conspicuous visits, taking note of the goings about in Shanxi. Although Shanxi has been undergoing a Ten Year plan since 1936, recently it has taken a new urgency. Change will come this time. Even if it's not clear yet to whose benefit. An even if tremendous sacrifice will be needed. But the people are, ever cautiously, hopeful."

 SHX_Ten_Year_Plan_disrupted: "Ten Year Plan Disrupted"
 SHX_Ten_Year_Plan_disrupted_desc: "All things must come to an end, and for the brief era of progress under the revitalised Ten Year Plan, it came too quickly. Shanxi, which has benefited from its relatively peaceful isolation from warlord conflicts and trade with the similarly stable central plains region under Zhili control, is now once again at war. Maybe it was due to its leaders' ambitions or maybe it was due to no fault of their own, but war means the drafting of men, the depletion of funds, and destruction of infrastructure that inevitably disrupts all projects. Now, the Ten Year Plan is little more than a painful memory of what could have been."

 #Political Ideas
 SHX_order_of_the_vigilant_lion_idea: "Order of the Vigilant Lion"
 SHX_order_of_the_vigilant_lion_idea_desc: "The Order of the Vigilant Lion was originally established in Shanxi during the early days of the warlord era as a means of rewarding villagers and villages who successfully killed various desperados. At the time, brigands frequently roamed about - looting at random and extorting from the masses huddling behind the walls of town citadels. The mountainous terrain of Shanxi often worked against law enforcement, as these outlaws frequently retreated into the mountainside between raids. The Order was part of the Shanxi clique's early and defining successes in consolidating control of the province, and now with the increase of political instability from agitators both within and without it becomes necessary to reorient our state security policy towards targetting... \"bandits\". The heightened paranoia in the province has not done our political stability any favours, but few can doubt the success we have had in counterintelligence efforts."

 SHX_strengthen_local_councils: "Strengthen Local Councils"
 SHX_strengthen_local_councils_desc: "As part of Shaanxi's efforts to move forward in harnessing public support for our agenda, it becomes necessary to empower local councils in various villages in towns. These efforts have been modelled after Feng Yuxiang's Rural Training institutes, which sought to teach villages under his control the fundamentals needed for self-governing. This of course has led to plenty of head-butting with members of the gentry, who traditionally hold power in these councils, as well as that of the provincial bureaucracy - which has sought to curtail the power of village councils. An outsider should also be wary of overestimating this effort in bringing out a Western-style, liberal democracy - although no doubt with sincere motivations behind them, these programmes are closer in nature to Sun Yat-sen's political tutelage and it will be a long time before a genuine democracy is established in China."

 SHX_consolidate_bureaucracy: "Consolidate Bureaucracy"
 SHX_consolidate_bureaucracy_desc: "As part of Shanxi's efforts to move forward in harnessing the province's resources for our agenda, it becomes necessary to increase the power and scope of our provincial bureaucracies in reigning in other power structures in our province. Centred around the Institute of Political Administration established by Yan Xishan, magistrates of Shanxi's hundreds of districts are being trained with the necessary skills to oversee the various villages and towns. This has led to pushback, naturally, by members of the gentry who tend to dominate the village councils these magistrates tread over, as well as various particularist peasant groups who resent the expanded influence of officers from Taiyuan. An outsider however should be wary of overestimating this effort in bringing about a Western-style, modern bureaucracy - although no doubt with sincere motivations behind them, this effort still struggles with corruption and entrenched political interests even as it tries to expand the reach of Yan Xishan's paternalistic dictatorship."

 SHX_a_higher_purpose_idea: "Reorienting Domestic Politics"
 SHX_a_higher_purpose_idea_desc: "Shanxi is at a crossroads of sorts, where the collective will of the people across the land the Shanxi clique rules must soon make a decision about what type of future they will pursue. Yan Xishan represents an authoritarian, Confucian-influence style of leadership - a sort of continuation of several decades of stability-focused rule. Conservative in thought but willing to embrace modernity, the old governor promises to restore the balance and harmony that was stolen from China. Feng Yuxiang also claims to want to bring China to the place it should be, however, his vision is rather different. A revolutionary and a soldier by trade, his view for the future involves a revolutionary, nationalistic sort of leadership that will bring about a social and political revolution to the nation. To him, he is restoring the democracy and reform that was similarly stolen from China after Xinhai. The decision is difficult, and the people are divided. But one thing is certain - Shanxi will go forward together!"

Backed primarily by the traditionalists, technocrats/bureaucrats, the gentry, and some conservative student radicals led by Liang Huazhi, the people have begun to rally around Yan Xishan's Shanxi-based provincial government. In doing so they have begun to carry out his vision - centralising the state apparatus around their model governor, implementing needed technocratic reforms, and cracking down on political corruption. The future seems bright, if only Shaanxi would join us."

 #Industry-Related Ideas
 SHX_underdeveloped_mountain_economy: "Underdeveloped Mountain Economy"
 SHX_underdeveloped_mountain_economy_desc: "Mountainous, agrarian and poor, in many ways Shanxi has been left behind by the industrial revolution - even by Chinese standards. One of the poorest provinces in China, Yan's leadership has brought about a peace that has promoted some limited prosperity. However, their economy remains heavily dominated by Beijing's influence from the outside and the suspicious gentry from within. Yan has desperately tried to reverse the trade deficit and soaring inflation in the 1920s, but his various endeavours litter the countryside half-finished at best. For all of their claims of being a \"Model Province\", the reality is more sordid. Plenty feel most of the projects the \"Model Governor\" embarks on are merely pretentious shows of \"progress\" for the consumption of outsiders rather than a sincere effort at reform. Only time will tell if they are right."

 SHX_underdeveloped_mountain_economy1: "Crashed Mountain Economy"
 SHX_underdeveloped_mountain_economy1_desc: "Mountainous, agrarian and poor - and now ten times worse - Shanxi's economy is in free-fall dealing with the aftershocks of Black Monday. While the actual impact of the global recession has been mostly muted in China as a whole, in many ways the recession falling over the nation has destabilised Shanxi's fragile industrial economy. Its cottage industries, already years in decline as a product of the meandering Ten Year Plan, are teetering on the verge of collapse: candlemakers, copper utensil crafters, pawnshops. Shanxi's limited industrial base is also beginning to fail, with textile mills, match factories, and Shanxi's only distillery all in the red, it is estimated that nine tenths of Taiyuan's businesses are on the verge of bankruptcy. Unemployment is soaring, with nearly a third of the population out of work. Students have begun protesting that their only prospect is to \"graduate and join the jobless\" while the ranks of people entering the poorhouse are expected to double. Worse yet, the social impacts of this crash are quickly being felt as the chill of crime falls over the city, propelled by the people's desperation. Something needs to be done soon - a strong leader must emerge or at least fingers need to be pointed."

 SHX_underdeveloped_mountain_economy2: "Budding State Capitalism"
 SHX_underdeveloped_mountain_economy2_desc: "Shanxi's diarchy have long prided themselves as being \"state capitalists\" inspired at least in part by the modernisation efforts done in Japan as well as interventionist rhetoric by various politicians in the United States. This effort has only increased as of late, with a recent flurry of subsidies to prop up light industries in Taiyuan such as flour mills, cigarette factories, and paper mills. These smaller factories and workshops teach soldiers and the unemployed how to make soap, candles and clothing - as part of a broader network that underwrites Shanxi's heavier industry and helps keep the province somewhat self-sufficient. Still, there are the usual problems - high quotas and persistent corruption mean that the undertrained, underpaid factory managers tend to cut corners and costs. The inferior quality products often mean that Shanxi struggles to compete with products even made in China, at a time when many Western companies feel pressured to dump as much of their surplus production into the developing world to prop up their own economies during the global depression."

 SHX_underdeveloped_mountain_economy_feng: "Autarkic State Capitalism"
 SHX_underdeveloped_mountain_economy_feng_desc: "Governor Yan has frequently been quoted as saying \"proper organisation and administration is just as important as good machinery\". And with the recent direction governmental authorities have gone, a greater emphasis has been made on promoting a \"scientific management\" of industry. Indeed, while long a passion project of Governor Yan, who theorises that China has missed out on the West's \"Second Industrial Revolution\" of proper industrial management while barely embracing the first Industrial Revolution, this effort towards efficiency has also been taken up by many of Feng's supporters. To supplement the centralised control by provincial bureaucracy on the economy, Shanxi has been training a parallel hierarchy of technical experts to specialise in carrying out this Ten Year plan. Of course, with corruption still being a systematic problem and many administrators being appointed on the basis of nepotism, Shanxi still has a long way to go in this regard."

 SHX_underdeveloped_mountain_economy_feng1: "Autarkic Mountain Economy"
 SHX_underdeveloped_mountain_economy_feng1_desc: "It seems that after considerable effort and internal discipline, Shanxi has at last hit a crescendo with their industrial efforts. The Society of National Salvation Through Production (zao-chan jiu-guo she), a recently formed quasi-governmental organisation, have begun to aggressively push Shanxi's merchants to seek suppliers from within the province rather than seek contracts abroad. While many similar efforts were ignored or reluctantly followed, Shanxi has seen an upsurge in popular approval for these measures and a new economy is beginning to come to fruition. Corruption has begun to recede thanks to greater oversight, while the managers and workers have grown more accustomed to their industrial jobs. Wages are rising, but the government has opted to take things one step further. In an effort to stabilise the currency (which has seen tremendous inflation), the more ambitious planners in Taiyuan have advocated for the use of production certificates backed by government-stocked food and commodities in lieu of traditional money. Needless to say, some are wary of these major changes but Shanxi's leadership continue their march towards economic reform."

 SHX_underdeveloped_mountain_economy_feng2: "A Revolutionary Shanxi Economy"
 SHX_underdeveloped_mountain_economy_feng2_desc: "\"No longer enslaved by our monetary system, we are free to use our enormous human resources to develop our immense material resources\" is the boast of Taiyuan. Once merely idle talk between Yan and Feng, a truly revolutionary economic system has emerged in Shanxi. Although critics frequently complained that these production certificates were merely empty promises seeking to further exploit the people, the government has continued its reforms by establishing in cities and even towns government-run producers as well as consumer cooperative organisations. Producers are required to sell to these cooperatives, bringing Shanxi's economy heavily under the control of Taiyuan. Taiyuan in turn has been hard at work setting prices, regulating output and squeezing out foreign competition - to some success despite persistent mistrust. Regardless of its efficacy, people are hungry for change and this new system has been the talk (and sometimes ridicule) of many outside of Shanxi. Still, Shanxi promises to liberate this country, and it is clear that this industry is the basis for their plans."
 SHX_underdeveloped_mountain_economy_yan: "Developing Mountain Economy"
 SHX_underdeveloped_mountain_economy_yan_desc: "Shanxi has seen an influx of foreign capital, which has helped stabilise the economy and promote greater industrialisation centred around Taiyuan. Indeed, Shanxi proves to be quite suited for industry, with its easy access to coal and iron ore as well as a large labour pool. Old industries have been reorganised and thriving under new ownership, and new efforts at expanding paper mills, tanneries, and distilleries have created a large job market. To meet new demands a fire-resistant brick plant and cement plant are now under construction. There are many hurdles left in the way of course, and corruption remains a big issue, though it appears that Beijing's investors have not yet been cowed by this. Easy money has gone hand in hand with bribes and nepotism. While detrimental, for now, it appears to simply be a matter of doing business. Nonetheless, many of Shanxi's domestic businessmen complain from time to time about being exploited by speculators with a more sophisticated grasp of economic conditions - particularly encouraging them to overproduce on goods."

 SHX_underdeveloped_mountain_economy_yan1: "Revitalised Mountain Economy"
 SHX_underdeveloped_mountain_economy_yan1_desc: "Shanxi's economic boom has been nothing short of awe-inspiring, with production shooting through the roof and the quality of products made in Shanxi vastly improving. Bribes and nepotism have been mostly checked, with Shanxi's traditional banking clans growing more open to alliances with outside investors. The vast amounts of wealth flowing in and out of the province have smoothened over prior concerns, and Shanxi's capitalists are thinking long-term nowadays rather than scrounging for a quick cash grab. Urbanisation has been on the upswing, with people coming from across the province and even outside of it to seek jobs in Shanxi's factories. No doubt, much of the success of Shanxi's State Capitalism can be attributed to the partnership between Shanxi's government, its growing merchant class and foreign capitalists, but some wonder if things should be reigned in before the excesses grow too much. After all, when this plan was first initiated - was it not simply a temporary measure before liberation? Many wonder now if Shanxi will grow too decadent in its prosperity."
 SHX_underdeveloped_mountain_economy_yan2: "A Reborn Shanxi Economy"
 SHX_underdeveloped_mountain_economy_yan2_desc: "The Shanxi economic miracle will likely be something to be recorded in history books, something for others in China and elsewhere to emulate. With the right mixture of deregulation, while maintaining a collaborative approach to capital, state and labour, Shanxi's economic reforms have been nothing short of a glowing success. The opulence experienced by the elite of Shanxi has not been matched in the region since the days of the Piaohao, as the quality and scope of production in Shanxi have finally reached a point where Taiyuan's industries can compete for outside contracts. Not all industries survived, of course, there had to be some pruning done by both the free market and government authorities, but several - namely wool, matches, industrial alcohol, paper and bricks - have become a staple export of this province. There remain concerns of course, about the state of the people, the quality of Shanxi's rapidly built housing, and the new business culture setting into Shanxi's financial class. But Shanxi's economy has developed to the point that it may possibly be a contender once more for leadership of north China. The question is whether or not Shanxi will take that chance."

 SHX_black_monday_relief_desc: "Thanks to the generosity of the National Assembly, Shanxi has been allocated a significant financial relief package to alleviate the burden of the recent worldwide depression. China as a whole has thankfully avoided the worst of the financial meltdown, and Shanxi even more so. However, that is not to say this initiative is unappreciated. More funding has reduced the burden placed upon the provincial treasury, and helped stem the wave of unemployment in the province - at least for the time being."

 SHX_expanded_beijing_investment_desc: "Shanxi's move to open up its economy to foreign investment has paid off in a few ways as of late, with a large boon to its fortune particularly evident in the area around Taiyuan. Outside investors have brought in the necessary capital to jumpstart many private business initiatives around the city, creating a sustained (if likely temporary) period of growth for the previously stagnant Shanxi economy."

Consolidating their holdings in a few key consortiums in an effort to spread out risk, they also seek to protect their investment by banding together. These primarily Sino-German investors have no doubt brought considerable assets and expertise needed to rapidly improve Shanxi's economy, however some wonder if the Governor's avarice might be getting the better of him."

The Shanxi provincial government has worked with him in the past in their crusade to give every child a primary school education, and it seems that this partnership has continued in a form with a recent bill passed by the National Assembly to allocate more funds to the province to continue their education efforts.

This has severely hurt local producers, who protested to no avail at the new trade policies. However, there is ultimately little that Shanxi could do about it in the near future.

Rather than end this (admittedly sometimes inefficient) system, the leadership has opted to try and clean up the corruption in industry leadership and improve working conditions somewhat. Coal is, after all, a strategic resource and must be fully utilised to the benefit of the state and its people!"

 SHX_privatized_railroad_bank_desc: "Founded as part of Shanxi's banking reforms in 1936, the short-lived Shanxi-Suiyuan Railroad bank suffered from issues early on as a state bank. Although Yan and his administration had placed millions of dollars into this enterprise, the bank has suffered from a lack of clear direction (especially given the Shanxi clique's incomplete or lack of control of Shanxi and Suiyuan) and still some capital shortfalls. As a result, the leadership of Shanxi has opted to privatise this state bank, allowing foreign investors to place their money into it and de facto take control. They have begun providing generous loans out to railroad development, helping connect the Northwest."

This heavy-handed and centrally planned economic system is like a lumbering ship: difficult to steer but sailing along nevertheless. Still, by coordinating Shanxi's coal, textiles, factories and workshops, there is hope that this policy will help create a new industrial network that can put Shanxi on solid economic footing. The first few months of heightened attention is expected to reap the majority of its successes."

Still, in this time of flux, it appears the next few months have given Shanxi's economy time to breathe anew. The Governor especially hopes to stabilise the previously ballooning provincial inflation."

 #Agriculture Related Ideas
 SHX_agriculture_reform: "Impoverished Countryside"
 SHX_agriculture_reform_desc: "One of Shanxi's most prominent features is its highly stratified, backwards agricultural sector - a problem that has vexed policymakers (or at least the ones who care enough to pay attention) for decades. Due to Shanxi's mountainous terrain, very little of Shanxi's land is arable. Much of the fertile regions are concentrated near alluvial deposits in valleys neighbouring rivers. Central Shanxi in particular holds the Taiyuan basin, the heart of provincial power, which also hosts much of the extremely unpopular and exploitative tenantry system that places both beasts and men under a heavy yoke. Even in areas where tenantry is uncommon and most farmers own the land they till, the years of drought, a lack of modern technology, poor water control methods, governmental corruption and years of neglect have built up years of resentment that threaten to translate to revolutionary fever.\n\nThe human cost aside, Shanxi's agricultural sector is in many ways primitive and unprofitable to the detriment of the overall economy. Shanxi spends considerable amounts of specie annually to import food, worsening the trade deficit, despite agricultural pay being worse than in places such as India and the Philippines. Well over half (upwards of three quarters) live in absolute destitution, while the political scene is dominated by a rural gentry perceived as callous and uncaring. What resources are generated by Shanxi's farms and mills are rarely reinvested back into the economy, often squandered on frivolous expenses such as weddings while Shanxi's productivity slides further and further behind even other poor parts of China. Prior attempts by the provincial governments at uplifting the region have been largely unsuccessful and the Ten Year Plan (even when being implemented) largely neglects the farmers. But as the farmers toil under the hot sun, disillusionment threatens to turn to rage, and rage into action. It is clear that something must be done - and soon."

 SHX_agriculture_reform1: "Promises of Land Reform"
 SHX_agriculture_reform1_desc: "When the Xinhai revolution broke out nearly two decades ago, many hoped that the conditions in the countryside would finally change. Yan Xishan took charge of Shanxi along with other revolutionaries, and in his quest to revitalise the province placed a heavy emphasis on building up the agricultural economy. And yet, well over a decade later, Shanxi has little to show for it. Even as the province's authorities promise to invest in agriculture as much as they are in industry, promise to educate the farmers in modern techniques, and promise to improve the conditions of the people - all the people can hear is just that: empty words. Attempts at reforms to the common farmer simply means higher taxes and further infighting between the gentry and the state over the share of the agricultural surplus, with only a trickle falling down to the overworked and overburdened Laobaixing. It is no surprise that they are disappointed - litigation remains a powerful tool in the arsenal of the wealthy to keep the poor down, the government is frequently cowed by the demands of the gentry in rural matters, and even the nominally independent farmers are easy prey for usury by wealthy moneylenders.\n\nShanxi's leadership talk a big game about the future of the province, but it will require far more than just talk to accomplish anything of note. The original Ten Year Plan largely ignores the needs of Shanxi's agricultural sector in favour of heavy industrialisation, but it is also evident that Shanxi will need to address the situation in the countryside soon."

 SHX_agriculture_reform_Yan: "Nominal Land Reform"
 SHX_agriculture_reform_Yan_desc: "The powers that be in Shanxi have elected to begin a process of moderated land reform, which entails the implementation of a series of policies meant to check the excesses of the agricultural elite while also purchasing and redistributing some land to the tillers. This has not been without considerable difficulty, as Shanxi's traditional powerbrokers in the gentry have taken a conservative stance - threatening to block progress. Many suspect the process as being hijacked by socialists or by a power-hungry Governor seeking to expand his influence at the expense of others, even as he tries to reassure them that this is the only way to avoid large-scale unrest. Of particular note is the emergence of the so-called \"Justice Force\" which has been assembled out of previous Village Inspection Committee leaders to help tackle rural corruption and further implement the Ten Year Plan. Their efforts, though sincere, frequently run into difficulties as Shanxi tries to toe the middle line between revolution and reaction but progress is being made in making a more equitable countryside."

 SHX_agriculture_reform_Feng: "Limited Redistribution"
 SHX_agriculture_reform_Feng_desc: "The powers that be in Shanxi have elected to begin a measured process of land redistribution, purchasing (or seizing if necessary) large estates and reselling them to individual families or larger peasant cooperatives. This has earned the ire of the gentry, who have sought to obstruct this process as much as possible. Many reject assurances that these measures are to be limited in scope and are being done in the name of fairness - contending instead that they are an effort by an avaricious, power-crazed socialist cabal of thugs. Indeed, Shanxi has been toeing a fine line in keeping up the heat on the gentry to reform while avoiding inflaming tensions to the point that the entire countryside is set ablaze. The increased presence of militias (government, gentry-funded and peasant-organised) seems to confirm the suspicions of many that Shanxi is teetering on the verge of social collapse - but few doubt that the populist measures embarked on by the government have been popular. The question of the day however is whether or not the ultimate product will be the more egalitarian system they seek or another costly failure in Shanxi's campaign for progress."

 SHX_agriculture_reform_Yan1: "Confucian Farming Ideal"
 SHX_agriculture_reform_Yan1_desc: "Yan Xishan and his circle have frequently looked to Confucian principles for inspiration in their governing practices, holding in particular esteem Confucian principles of harmony, authority and moderation. The fear of disorder and revolution has frequently entered the language of Shanxi governmental agents, as they hope to promote a more balanced, virtuous system. This appears to be the case for Shanxi's recent endeavours at improving the agricultural situation in the province, where provincial leaders have implemented a battery of reforms. These include suppressing the use of litigation as a means of coercion, implementing rent caps, redistributing some properties, and providing greater government oversight into the conduct of the gentry and the local governments they control. Further efforts appear to have been made in terms of material investments in the countryside, which have helped make Shanxi more productive and improved the quality of life for the people in it. The Governor in particular has gone further in building a culture of noblesse oblige, fostering an image that he is a Junzi - the epitome of Confucian virtue. History and time will tell whether or not this is merely propaganda, but even his critics will agree that Shanxi's peasants and even the gentry to an extent are far better off than they were at the start of the Ten Year Plan."

 SHX_agriculture_reform_Feng1: "Land to the Tiller"
 SHX_agriculture_reform_Feng1_desc: "Feng Yuxiang and his circle have cited many prior thinkers, philosophers and reformers for the need to return the land away from the gentry (who have hoarded an unfair portion) back to the simple men who till the soil every year. Some may say that this is a deceptively easy accomplishment, given that most farmers in Shanxi were not tenants even before the Ten Year Plan, but that belies the entrenched hierarchies and dogmatic opposition Shanxi's reformers fought through to get to where they are today. A wide-ranging series of reforms were carried out, including the mass redistribution of property to the peasants and the enforcement of laws upon the wealthy (who had traditionally enjoyed immunity to such things). This did cause chaos at first, and although the government downplays it - violence - but in the end, the forces of the humble farmer won out. Material investments were also made in the countryside to improve productivity and try to reduce the dependence of the peasants on predatory loans, though the disruption caused by these efforts means that in some areas things still lag behind. But few can doubt that the efforts made by Shanxi's leadership have truly inspired the people they sought to help, reversing a trend of cynicism and building a life-long base of public support. This has fostered an image that the Governor is a hero of the Laobaixing, a champion of the people that is willing to do what it takes to bring about a fairer system. And that type of reputation goes a long way, far beyond the borders of this humble province. History and time will tell whether or not this is merely propaganda, but even his critics will agree that Shanxi's peasants are far better off than they were at the start of the Ten Year Plan."

 SHX_paying_off_gentry: "Paying off the Gentry"
 SHX_paying_off_gentry_desc: "The gentry have, after some pressure by the forces that be, agreed to back off from some of their demands. However, their compliance has not come cheap. They have demanded a rather extensive portion of the harvest, not to mention hard currency upfront to cease their activities against recent land reform measures. To avoid any further obstructions, we must work with them. However, it does show the extent to which the landed elite continue to maintain their hold over the province."

 SHX_agriculture_budget: "Redirected Agricultural Budget"
 SHX_agriculture_budget_desc: "Wasteful spending and corruption are not uncommon in China, but in a province as poor as Shanxi they can be devastating. In their drive to reform agriculture, Shanxi's leadership has found that building meaningful reforms often mean sweeping away the dried-out husks of prior, failed reforms made as late as the early 1930s. Indeed, as the expenses mount and the finances remain tight, Shanxi's response to their soaring needs was to reassemble the entire agricultural budget. The Governor has assured the province that a clever mixture of raising taxes, cutting wasteful spending, and some foreign donations were the source of this new budget, though the specifics are a tight-kept secret. Most however are happy to ignore the clear efforts at evasion, which is common in Shanxi when it comes to money and budgets, and focus instead on the greater investments available for Shanxi's suffering peasants."

 SHX_fight_corruption_idea: "Crusade against Corruption"
 SHX_fight_corruption_idea_desc: "Agricultural Corruption is, unfortunately, an all too common reality in Shanxi. Large agricultural clans utilise their wealth to take control of village leadership, moneylending practices like pawnshops and banks, the courts, and of course the economic system controlling the land itself. The Governor has mustered a raft of anti-corruption agencies to combat this, headed by the newly established Provincial Political Planning Committee and the Shanxi People's Political Supervisorial Association. The former oversees the over ten-thousand Village Inspection Committees and their Justice Force comrades who regularly audit villages and report upon their \"enthusiasm\" for the Governor's reforms. The latter agency publishes a weekly editorial known as \"Supervisorial Weekly\", publicly exposing the various wrongs members of the elite commit unto the commoners. The enthusiasm of this organisation has shocked many, with bold arrests and denouncements of thousands of officials, gentrymen, and other elites that have traditionally avoided scrutiny. Still, it has been a cause of concern as investigators continue to search up the chain - many fear who they may implicate next."

 SHX_enforce_truancy_idea_desc: "As part of Shanxi's efforts at increasing educational effectiveness, the leadership has elected to begin enforcing truancy laws for all students in primary and middle school education. This is no easy task, with many students growing up without an official birth certificate due to the province's poor ability to track its people. Indeed, this has created some disruption as many students who would normally become full-time apprentices to tradesmen are no longer able to do so during school hours. It remains to be seen if this effort will be worth it in the end, while it is a very idealistic policy, the realities of China are often very harsh."
 SHX_militarized_youth_schools: "Militarised Youth"
 SHX_militarized_youth_schools_desc: "\"Men struggle with each other for what they want and war is a means of resolving this struggle, and since war is unavoidable, brute force inevitably will triumph, which means that morality is less important than national defence and economic reconstruction.\"\n\nThis reasoning, offered by Yan Xishan, underlies the harsh realities of China and the resumption of the militarisation of men from a young age. Forming groups such as the Youth Vanguard Corps and establishing the Shanxi Junior Middle School Boy's Army, young men in Shanxi are harshly trained starting in their teens in the ways of war."

 SHX_unfinished_education: "Stalled Educational Reforms"
 SHX_unfinished_education_desc: "Although much talk has been made about the quality of Yan Xishan's educational reforms, his praiseworthy efforts at modernising education in Shanxi have largely hit a wall since the 1920s. Major achievements such as the creation of widespread access to primary schooling, the promotion of literacy and the creation of a practical, Western-inspired educational system have suffered severe setbacks due to funding cuts and neglect as a consequence of the Zhili-Fengtian wars. The Guominjun, for all their campaigning about educating the public, have proven similarly delinquent on their promises - establishing schools but failing to follow through."
 SHX_unfinished_education1: "Resumed Educational Reforms"
 SHX_unfinished_education1_desc: "The powers that be in Shanxi have, begrudgingly, begun a new effort to revitalise education in Shanxi. Despite both Feng and Yan having a tremendous prior interest in the subject, in part due to the ideological implications of shaping provincial youth, they have begun to significantly diverge in their approach to the issue. At the same time, the ripple effect of this resumed campaign to improve the people's knowledge has begun to receive pushback from conservatives, the gentry, academics and even the students themselves!"
 SHX_unfinished_education_yan: "Expanded Technical Education"
 SHX_unfinished_education_yan_desc: "It appears that Yan's line of thinking has begun to win out in the Shanxi clique's implementation of educational reforms. Greater priority has been placed on higher levels of education, promoting technical skills relevant to the economy of Shanxi. These include topics such as engineering, geology, craftsmanship, mathematics, and some foreign language. Of course, plenty of criticisms remain, especially with regard to the distribution of scholarships and the actual competency of the faculty. But most acknowledge that progress is being made."
 SHX_unfinished_education_yan1: "Modernised University Education"
 SHX_unfinished_education_yan1_desc: "Just half a decade ago, the University of Shanxi could be described as a vast resort where students and faculty gambled, partied, and neglected their studies. Now, much has changed - the people are more motivated, funding is more readily available, and the curriculum is finally up to par for the heavy-duty research needed by the province. In this small, but concentrated bubble, Yan Xishan has lit a candle that will lead the rest of Shanxi out of the darkness. One day."
 SHX_unfinished_education_feng: "Expanded School Access"
 SHX_unfinished_education_feng_desc: "The Guominjun way has begun to win out as the Shanxi clique's implementation of educational reforms progress. With Shanxi's limited resources, Feng has opted to try and provide some degree of primary and secondary schooling to all students across the province, prioritising literacy and \"virtue\". Much of this has come at a cost and not without controversy - Feng's willingness to embrace heavy, some say extortionate, taxation and also conversions of Buddhist temples to schools has not won him many friends. But the Guominjun insist this effort will bring about a more equal and more productive society in the end."
 SHX_unfinished_education_feng1: "Universal Primary Schooling"
 SHX_unfinished_education_feng1_desc: "At the start of the decade, the implementation of universal primary schooling was spotty and unequal. No more than a third of all primary school-age children attended class. Many parents refused to send their children to school and many schools were not worth sending their children to. Through the efforts of the Guominjun, virtually all students in Shanxi attend at least primary schooling. Rural parents incorporate schooling into their work plans, the wealthy have largely accepted the higher taxation needed to fund local schools. An effort to revitalise higher education may have to wait, but they won't have to wait long."

After Wu Peifu established his dominance over the land with German aid and Zhang Zuolin carved out his domain in the Northeast with Japanese support, Yan and Feng were forced to settle for the scraps: exiled into a rugged backwater. Although both have approximately the same number of troops, Yan has been less successful in building a disciplined fighting force than Feng and his Guominjun. However, Yan controls the powerful Taiyuan arsenal, enhancing his troops with relatively modern artillery. Both have been united in their efforts to protect Shanxi's autonomy from central authorities, but refuse significant cooperation between commands that would allow for any meaningful integration. These dual armies are not cheap either - maintaining Shanxi's army has pushed the treasury near bankruptcy, something that has agitated both. This uneasy truce leaves many wondering how long this system can possibly last."

While this means our soldiers will be less centralised and professional, this will also us to more effectively tap into China's reserves of nearly unlimited manpower from provinces across China. Regional armies offer many advantages over a central army. Their soldiers are drawn from and posted near their homes, making them more willing to fight and less likely to rob. It also prevents central government tyranny, offering some protection to the various provinces. Over the next few years, we will slowly begin transitioning towards a system not unlike the American National Guard, boasting powerful reserve forces that can be mobilised rapidly in the event of a conflict."

This will mean more than simply expanding upon the existing core troops, but also integrating defectors from defeated factions, incorporating new technologies, training new loyal (and hopefully competent) officers, and ensuring the fresh influx of funding does not suddenly go \"missing\". Although certainly a challenge, if [SHX.GetLeader] wishes to keep his position as a contender for national leadership, this army will have to serve as the backbone for his ambitions."

 SHX_russian_aid: "Russian Advisors"
 SHX_russian_aid_desc: "The Russian Army, while humbled during the Weltkrieg, nonetheless is one of the most modern forces in the world and in the East. Due to our proximity with [RUS.GetName], let us invite advisors from the Russian Army to train and inspire our troops."

 SHX_japanese_aid: "Japanese Advisors"
 SHX_japanese_aid_desc: "Ever since their defeat of the Russians in 1904, none can deny the successful modernisation of the Meiji Restoration that has helped propel Japan to the international stage. The image of Japan throughout China is mixed as many see them as a great imperialist threat and affront to our soverignty while others see Japan's modernisation as something that China can emulate. Let us reach out to the Japanese for aid in developing our own armed forces although this move might not be popular amongst nationalists."

 SHX_german_aid: "German Advisors"
 SHX_german_aid_desc: "The German Army is probably the greatest in the world, having bested the major world powers during the Weltkrieg. Their role in China is marked with controversy as nationalists see the Germans as a vile foreign imperialist power that has reinstated the Great Qing while others see Germany's cooperation with China, as potential growth for China to resist the Japanese. Nonetheless, let us approach the Germans and study their Prussian military heritage so that we too may become a Prussian province in China."

 SHX_guominjun_commissars_idea: "Guominjun Commissars"
 SHX_guominjun_commissars_idea_desc: "We have decided to embrace a commissar model inspired by Feng's commissars within the Guominjun.

 SHX_yan_commissars_idea: "Yan's Political Instructors"
 SHX_yan_commissars_idea_desc: "We have decided to embrace a commissar model inspired by Yan's commissars within his own Jin Army. This means that our soldiers will be indoctrinated and taught to study and understand the wise teachings of Yan Xishan and his inspirations such as Zhao Daiwen - while also being taught to be good soldiers on and off the battlefield."

 SHX_artillery_idea: "Modernised Type 14"
 SHX_artillery_idea_desc: "The Type 14 howitzer and cannon models are products of Shanxi's very own Taiyuan Arsenal. Let us advance modernisation efforts for our artillery, so that the queen of the battlefield may give us her favour in our coming wars."

 SHX_renovated_taiyuan_idea: "Renovated Taiyuan Arsenal"
 SHX_renovated_taiyuan_idea_desc: "\"Armed force is the backing of justice\"\n\nThese words underwrote the foundation of Yan Xishan's decades-long rule, as he sought to preserve Shanxi's autonomy and stability. The Taiyuan Arsenal was the logical extension of this principle, a massive network of arms foundries that has allowed the province to supply their own armies independent of the central government or other warlord factions. Noted for its ability to not only create high-quality copies of foreign designs but also make advanced weaponry of its own, recent and extensive investment by Shanxi's leadership has dramatically increased production.\n\nBoasting a workforce of more than 15,000 staff members and churning out thousands of machine guns, artillery shells, and other equipment, Taiyuan has become a major hub of weapons manufacturing. Moreover, Shanxi's leaders have clearly stated their ambitions to produce other, more advanced weapons of war. Whether or not that is a serious endeavour or just another empty boast is beside the point: the arsenal is a force onto itself to be reckoned with"

 #Zhifeng Ideas

 SHX_war_of_liberation: "The War of National Liberation"
 SHX_war_of_liberation_desc: "The day has finally come for China to be freed! Though few would suspect that such a poor region could sustain a nation liberating army, we have proved them wrong through our tireless efforts. As we advance, our men feel an increasing sense of jubilation as they grow closer to China's strongholds. Despite the powerful foes that lie ahead, it seems that nothing can stop us.\n\nWell, if only that were the case. To actually maintain such momentum, we have fully tapped out every resource possible in the areas under our control. This will sap popular support for our cause, and it is obvious we cannot sustain this sort of effort forever. It is imperative that we take major population centres to free our beloved nation...and to replenish our coffers."

 SHX_war_of_resistance: "The War of Resistance"
 SHX_war_of_resistance_desc: "A great war has come to the land, threatening the freedom of all of all Chinese citizens. Powerful outsiders seek to enslave our people, the much feared culmination of the Century of Humiliation. We must rally together with all of China against this threat, mustering all of our energies to combat the foreign foe. Together, we shall drive them out and all the Hanjian who chose to stand with them over their countrymen."

 SHX_central_plains_war_idea: "The Central Plains War!"
 SHX_central_plains_war_idea_desc: "Sensing Yan Xishan's imminent betrayal to monarchist factions, Feng Yuxiang has rallied his men for a savage surprise attack on Jin Clique lines, with the aim of overwhelming critical positions before Yan and his allies can consolidate power. Many of Yan's republican followers, disillusioned with his decision to side with reactionaries in Beijing, have defected causing major holes in their lines, especially with the ongoing fighting against the Zhili remnant. It is clear that Yan has been caught off-guard, but it will not be long before he brings the full weight of Beijing against us."

 SHX_total_collapse_idea: "Total Collapse"
 SHX_total_collapse_idea_desc: "It appears we have reached the end of the line. Having expended the last of our people's energies, they are no longer willing to sacrifice any further for our cause. Our troops are deserting en masse while their officers defect to more successful powers. The secret police are awash with conflicting reports, seeing conspiracies in every shadow while reports that [SHX.GetLeader] intends to flee grows by the day.\n\nAs the protests grow in [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and our foes draw closer and closer, it is clear that there will be no protracted resistance to defend the rule of [SHX.GetLeader]. Unless by some miracle the situation drastically changes, it appears that history will remember him as another failure in a sea of warlords."

 SHX_cadre_training_force_idea: "Shanxi Cadre Training Force"
 SHX_cadre_training_force_idea_desc: "We will need to rally the province in one formidable force in order to prepare for the storm ahead. Even the student in the classroom must trade his books for a rifle as Shanxi heads to war."

 SHX_revolutionary_army_idea: "The People's Revolutionary Defence Corps"
 SHX_revolutionary_army_idea_desc: "The revolution begins not just by the mobilisation of arms or by useless plodding bureaucrats but rather it also begins with raising the revolutionary consciousness of the country as a whole. To embrace modernity, to embrace change, to embrace national salvation - is to embrace the National Revolution. Let us tend to the education of the masses so that they may become the vanguard of the Chinese Revolution."

 SHX_spy_agency: "Peace Preservation Bureau"
 SHX_spy_agency_desc: "Danger lurks everywhere as our province finds itself pulled into conflict. In order to assure order and stability within our borders, let us create the Peace Preservation Bureau. From the dark street corners to the bustling merchant stalls, our policemen will patrol the streets - searching and seeking every potential threat throughout Shanxi."

 SHX_spy_agency_2_idea_desc: "$SHX_spy_agency_desc"

 SHX_baoding_investment_idea: "Baoding Investments"
 SHX_baoding_investment_idea_desc: "While the Central Government has supplied us with construction advisors and engineers to help develop our arms industries, we have to pay for their services with our meagre treasury."

 SHX_fortress_shanxi: "Fortress Shanxi"
 SHX_fortress_shanxi_desc: "The fall of the old central government will likely go down in history as a pivotal moment in the development of the post-Xinhai order. As various forces converge in northern China, [SHX.GetLeader] has elected to hold his existing positions rather than risk a dangerous advance against his rivals. This will give [SHX.GetName] time to recover and consolidate their gains, but perhaps at a cost of strategic initiative."

 #Suiyuan Ideas
 SHX_suiyuan_QIE_neutrality_idea: "Neutrality in the Northwest"
 SHX_suiyuan_QIE_neutrality_idea_desc: "Perhaps due to external distractions or perhaps in hopes of checking Yan Xishan's ambitions, we have elected to remain neutral in the escalating disputes between Shanxi and their neighbours, merely stating our desire to preserve peace and requesting both parties come to an amicable resolution. Shanxi will avoid involving us (at least directly) in their quest to reclaim Suiyuan, territory stripped from them following their defeat in the Fourth Zhili-Fengtian war, and we shall remain out of Northwestern affairs for the time being."

 SHX_hui_cavalry_idea: "Harnessed Hui Cavalry"
 SHX_hui_cavalry_idea_desc: "Accustomed to the rugged terrain of the Northwest and having produced extensive ranks of veterans fighting for Chinese authority across the 1910s onwards, the Hui clans in Xibei are a force to be reckoned with. Prized in particular for their role as shock cavalry and hardy scouts, they are a scourge for even our Mongolian rivals. Incensed by their defeat in the Northwest war, many seek employment in our armies under the services of their captains - egged on by their faith, nationalism, loot, or revenge. We naturally welcome them into our ranks, however unfortunately interest among the Hui as well as the shock element they provide against our enemies will likely eventually fade over time. Still, this only serves to motivate us to ride quickly to numerous victories and solidify their reputation as horsemen for the annals of Chinese history!"
 SHX_decisive_first_strike_idea: "Decisive First Strike in the Northwest"
 SHX_decisive_first_strike_idea_desc: "Tensions have been rising in the Northwest, as numerous reports of border skirmishes, raids, and shelling trickling in from along the frontier. In many places, there is no effective border anymore besides the various blockhouses and outposts established by soldiers in the area. Militias are being trained, guerrillas and bushwhackers prepare along the steppes, and cavalry rides out in front of our regulars' vanguard.\n\nIf we are to achieve success in Xibei, we need to be prepared for a powerful first blow against our opponents. One that will sweep away their petty preparations and destabilise even any fallback lines they prepare. Given our relatively limited aims in the area, one sold advance should ensure us a powerful position on the bargaining table and hopefully avoid a protracted conflict."

#####Endgame Ideas

 SHX_rapid_military_buildup_idea: "Rapid Militarisation"
 SHX_rapid_military_buildup_idea_desc: "With the economy finally recovering and a large central authority upon China once more since the collapse of the Qing Dynasty in 1911, the new Republican Chinese government has begun a rapid process of miltiarisation in both naval and arms production, in the hopes of catching up the capacity and quality of the Chinese Armed Forces to the rest of the world."

 SHX_rapid_naval_modernisation_idea: "Crash Naval Modernisation"
 SHX_rapid_naval_modernisation_idea_desc: "Initially based in landlocked Shanxi, the forces of [SHX.GetLeader] have little naval experience. Defence of China's expansive coastline has traditionally been handled by the central government, a responsibility that now befalls the nation's most recent claimant to leadership. Working with recruited naval staff (who have traditionally avoided any strong loyalties) and whatever dockyards they could lay their hands upon, [SHX.GetName] has engaged in a mass programme to assemble a fleet for the nation. Although perhaps unlikely to be a match for Japan and other imperialist powers, even a small and sea-worthy squadron goes a long way in restoring Chinese national pride."

 SHX_rapid_air_development_idea: "Air Modernisation Programme"
 SHX_rapid_air_development_idea_desc: "Back in the old days, both Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang engaged in small-scale projects in establishing an airforce, enamoured by the successful flights by western pilots and their usage during the Weltkrieg. Their independent schools were successful in churning out a few dozen pilots, though never at the scale that it would tip the tides of any national conflict. Having finally secured the industrial base to actually afford a meaningful airforce, [SHX.GetLeader] and his commanders have ordered the mass expansion of the national airforce. If successful, it could be a major game changer against any remaining warlords, and possibly even in a peer conflict with another major power."
 SHX_rapid_air_development_russian_idea: "Russian Air Modernisation Programme"

 SHX_national_academies: "National Academies"
 SHX_national_academies_desc: "China was once a prosperous land, a beacon of enlightenment and progress for the entire world. The last century has robbed it of its greatness and forced China to sit on the sidelines. In this new age of stability, wise men and other intellectuals are once more able to gather in our newly refurbished and refunded institutions. Scholars who had previously been pushed to study abroad to receive a modern education can, at last, come and teach a new generation, no longer afraid of being conscripted or persecuted by ignorant warlords. With an array of funding for the Universities and Colleges of [SHX.GetName], [SHX.GetLeader] is working to build a new golden age for Chinese academia."

 SHX_republic_of_china_navy_idea: "Republic of China Navy"
 SHX_republic_of_china_navy_idea_desc: "The precursor to the Republican Navy owes itself to the Ministry of the Navy following the creation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of China in 1911. As part of the newly unified Republican government's emphasis on national modernisation and reforms, efforts have been revived to spur on the creation of a new modern Republican Chinese Navy - determined to patrol, protect, and secure the great seas that surround the Chinese nation"

With our industrial and military strength stronger than ever before, the task is now thrust upon us to continue the legacy left behind by those before us and to create a truly powerful and modern air force for the Chinese people"

 SHX_strengthening_legislature_idea_desc: "Our government has made a determined effort to work with both Independents and parties to better hear their voices and provide representation for the people.

 SHX_currying_international_exports_idea: "Currying International Exports"
 SHX_currying_international_exports_idea_desc: "Our government has made a determined effort to modernise our economy by lowering trade barriers and securing foreign investment in our country.

 SHX_investments_in_education_idea: "Investments In Education"
 SHX_investments_in_education_idea_desc: "Our government has made a determined effort to expand access to education for all people in China, whether it be mandatory public schooling for children,scholarships for secondary education, or technical retraining for workers. This will be a costly process, curriculem will need to be modernised over the objections of some, and many classrooms will be oversized and understaffed during the transition period. But in the end it will be worth it."
 SHX_expansive_land_reform_idea: "Expansive Land Reform"
 SHX_expansive_land_reform_idea_desc: "Our government has made a determined effort to redistribute the land to the tillers who work it. Given the effectively feudal, unequal nature of the country-side, this is bound to be popular among the common people but will shake up the established order nation-wide. Only time will tell if this will ultimately make the land more productive or if it will merely inflame social tensions."
 SHX_bureau_of_progress_idea: "Bureau of Progress"
 SHX_bureau_of_progress_idea_desc: "Our government has made a determined effort to streamline military production, consolidating the Chinese defence industry and rooting out corruption and inefficiency along the way. The Bureau of Progress has set high production targets for everything from guns to tanks to airplanes, though how much mileage they will get out of an exhausted China remains to be seen."
 SHX_reconciling_north_south_idea: "Reconciling North and South"
 SHX_reconciling_north_south_idea_desc: "The death of Yuan Shikai saw the consolidation of existing divisions between the Northern Beiyang Government and the Southern Constitutional Protection Government. Attempts to reconcile the two regularly fell through and each saw continued instability until finally China could only be united through force. But unification does not mean unity - rebuilding the bonds of national brotherhood will require determined effort."
 SHX_eliminate_regionalism_idea: "Eliminate Regionalism"
 SHX_eliminate_regionalism_idea_desc: "The forcible devolution of powers from central authority through Manchu ineptitude, pervasive corruption, provincial force of arms has been a bane to national unity in our time of need. We may have subjugated the great warlords, but the petty warlords, their insidious cronies and imperialists that enabled them remain. They must be rooted out so our benevolence can shine through even the tallest mountains."

 #Qing Influence Decisions
 SHX_QIE_ties: "In Beijing's Shadow"
 SHX_QIE_ties_desc: "The Central Government has long loomed over our shoulders, watching and waiting for us to slip. However, their humiliating failure in reigning in the League before its collapse has demonstrated their weakness, and Yan has wisely opened up the possibility of negotiating as equals.\n\nHistorically, our efforts over the years to keep their influence at a minimum have been mostly successful, albeit at the price of isolation and inefficiency. The Central Government almost completely surrounds us, choking us off from independent connections. Greater cooperation with Beijing offers many possibilities in helping us modernise the province. However, we must be wary as to allowing them too much sway in our economy. After all, their tendrils are likely to be unsatisfied with merely the realm of economics, and will try to branch out into other key pillars keeping our government in power.\n\nForget not our ultimate objective, which is to save our nation. §RBe warned that our interactions with Beijing are not one-sided, they also have plenty of cards in their hands.§! If we are to slip out of Beijing's yoke, we must be cunning.\n\n[SHX_paying_with_inf_or_pp_defined_text]"

 SHX_switch_payment: "Switch Payment"
 SHX_switch_payment_desc: "Click this decision to change between paying with Qing influence or political power!"

 SHX_suiyuan_betrayal_decision: "Defect from the Central Government"
 SHX_suiyuan_betrayal_decision_desc: "The Central Government has humiliated us over the question of Suiyuan, greatly diminishing our stature and bringing to question the value of our so-called alliance. The Governor sees no further need for cooperation with Beijing, and says we ought to find our own path, independent of the treacherous words of Beijing."

 SHX_hire_qie_labour: "Hire Skilled Labourers from Zhili Province"
 SHX_hire_qie_labour_desc: "Compared to the workers of Shanxi, due to their proximity to Tianjin and Beijing, the labourers of Zhili Province are by far more skilled and knowledgeable. With the economy of China in shambles, let us invite them with our offers for lucrative and cheap land, in exchange for their labour."

 SHX_hire_qie_labour2: "Hire Skilled Labourers from Zhili Province"
 SHX_hire_qie_labour2_desc: "Compared to the workers of Shanxi, due to their proximity to Tianjin and Beijing, the labourers of Zhili Province are by far more skilled and knowledgeable. With the economy of China in shambles, let us invite them with our offers for lucrative and cheap land, in exchange for their labour."

 SHX_military_construction_crews: "Hire Military Construction Crews"
 SHX_military_construction_crews_desc: "Our military infrastructure while relatively modern for Chinese standards could certainly use the aid of military manufacturing plant workers and staff from nearby Zhili province. As their facilities are significantly more modern (as a result of their past cooperation with the Germans), let us see what we can learn from them."

 SHX_seek_loan_from_beijing: "Seek a Loan from [QIE.GetNameDef]"
 SHX_seek_loan_from_beijing_desc: "In order to further our continued economic progress and development, let us propose a loan to the government in Beijing to aid in our reforms. This increase in liquidity is essential in implementing virtually anything in this province - whether it be bribing critical power holders or purchasing modern tools or reassuring the business community of the stability of our bonds."

 #Qing side of Influence Decisions
 SHX_QIE_shanxi_diplomacy_decisions_category: "Our Interests in Shanxi"
 SHX_QIE_shanxi_diplomacy_decisions_category_desc: "The Shanxi clique, with its high mountains and dual armies, has long been a thorn in our side. We have a few arrows in our quiver to keep them compliant, and §Gothers may emerge as the situation develops§!. Maintaining our sphere of influence is vital to protecting the Northwest.\n\nShanxi's §Ywar support§! is a critical factor in determining their ability to mobilise against us. Keeping their §Ywar support§! from growing too high is essential if we are to maintain national unity. Their §Ywar support§! is currently [?SHX.has_war_support|%R0]\n\nBe wary also of the rising influence of the Guominjun - the renegade faction of the Zhili clique that has tapped so deeply into the revolutionary spirit that they are unwilling to work with us at all. §CThe Guominjun are [SHX.GMJ_coup_strength].§!\n\nThe Shanxi clique's nominal submission to our government is of little reassurance given our past animosity. Nonetheless, the circumstances of the post-League environment mean that we have a very limited opportunity to potentially change our relations with Shanxi and its leadership. In this dance, both Taiyuan and Beijing will have the ability to manipulate the situation to their advantage. Keeping our §Ginfluence high§!, their §Ywar support low§!, and the §RGuominjun out§! of power will keep Shanxi aligned to our interests."

 SHX_QIE_begin_negotiations: "Offer Negotiations with Taiyuan"
 SHX_QIE_begin_negotiations_desc: "The victory of Yan Xishan against the traitorous Feng Yuxiang in Shanxi also marks the high-water mark of our influence. If we do not act soon, the Governor may get some foolish ideas to rebel himself now that he no longer needs our help stemming the red tide. We need to move quickly to secure the loyalty of the province, and if necessary give certain concessions to appease the wily warlord. A message shall be dispatched offering to host negotiations at our capital, and if he is smart he will come with an offer in hand. Odds are he will be expecting some territorial concessions for any potential alliance. Still, this perhaps is the only path to lasting peace in the Central Plains."

 SHX_QIE_court_influence_in_taiyuan: "Court Influence in Taiyuan"
 SHX_QIE_court_influence_in_taiyuan_desc: "Despite their pretences, the warlord is merely the centre of a much larger and winding web of political, military and economic connections. And, more importantly, one that can be undermined and possibly supplanted by a stronger and more determined force. It might be too early for us to consider eliminating [SHX.GetLeader] from the picture. However, there is nonetheless considerable utility in pulling in a few figures our way, one at a time. Perhaps a down-on-his-luck industrialist and his corporation, the naive idealist and his students, the long-time Colonel passed over for promotion, or the disaffected landowner and their clan -there are potential candidates all along the web. All of this of course costs money, but that is a price we are willing to pay."

 SHX_QIE_relief_for_shanxi: "Black Monday Relief Package"
 SHX_QIE_relief_for_shanxi_desc: "Ever since the global meltdown caused by the Berlin Stock Exchange, we have been working tirelessly to stabilise the situation in China - thankfully we have been spared the worst of it. Nonetheless, there are many still begging us for help - including many merchants and industrialists in Taiyuan. Our agents on the ground, especially after speaking with Wang Xiang (a sympathetic and high-ranking member of Shanxi's government), indicate that offering an extensive series of loans and other forms of financial aid will earn us the gratitude of the business community - and place Governor [SHX.GetLeader] in our debt."

 SHX_QIE_buyout_local_companies: "Buyout Local Companies"
 SHX_QIE_buyout_local_companies_desc: "The Shanxi Government's initiative to open up their economy provides a unique opening for our own interests. Shanxi has had a heavily state-controlled industry for nearly a decade now, which makes their business dealings both opaque and inefficient. On the other hand, they sit upon the foundations needed for a fairly successful industrialisation: widespread access to high-quality coal, cheap labour, and decent infrastructure. And they have already begun industrialisation, even if it is still in its infancy. By organising investors on our end, including both Chinese and some of our allied foreigners, as well as mixing in a few shell companies owned by our government themselves, we stand to profit tremendously by purchasing recently privatised industries and smaller companies."

 SHX_QIE_entrench_our_grip: "Entrench Our Grip in Taiyuan"
 SHX_QIE_entrench_our_grip_desc: "Now that we have a foothold in Taiyuan, with various merchants, joint-stock companies, and other investors aligned with our interests (directly and indirectly), it is time that we consolidate our grasp in Shanxi. After all, Yan Xishan is a fickle man, and Feng Yuxiang is a traitor - there is no telling when the shoe will drop and they seek to betray us. The investors seem to recognise this too, fearing a potential nationalisation and loss of their recently acquired assets. As a result, we, as a silent partner, will have our agents begin a programme of consolidation of smaller companies into larger consortiums capable of better negotiating with the Shanxi administration."

 SHX_QIE_agricultural_relief_package: "Shanxi Agricultural Relief Package"
 SHX_QIE_agricultural_relief_package_desc: "The Rural Reconstruction Movement, led by intellectuals such as Yan Yangchu (James Yen) and Liang Shuming, have long backed various programmes to improve the Chinese countryside and centralise political control. While the extent to which we entertain these ambitions have risen and fallen over the years, they do present a very unique opportunity in Shanxi itself. The province is undergoing an agricultural reform programme, and is in dire need of more funding and technical support if they are to meet the unrealistic quotas their bosses have set. Therefore, one way for us to mask our influence is to have men like Yan and Liang sponsor a bill to allocate more agricultural resources to Shanxi - with our silent but critical influence in the final product. In this way, we can begin to court Shanxi's increasingly irate gentry, long neglected by Yan and scapegoated by Feng."

 SHX_QIE_literacy_campaign: "A Literacy Campaign for Shanxi"
 SHX_QIE_literacy_campaign_desc: "The battle against illiteracy, a passion project for many intellectuals, has taken a new turn with Shanxi's renewed commitment to improving education across the province. Yan Yangchu (James Yen) is a celebrity of sorts in the province for his years of experience battling youth illiteracy and encouraging such educational reforms, and he is willing to sponsor a bill before the National Assembly to send further educational aid into Shanxi. Naturally, of course, this has the side effect of putting many intellectuals in the province into contact with some of our own, and this diffusion of ideas will hopefully give us another in for our efforts to influence the province"

 SHX_QIE_beijing_training_group: "Deploy Baoding Training Group"
 SHX_QIE_beijing_training_group_desc: "Baoding military academy is one of the premier military academies in all of China, training generations of effective officers including Shanxi's Fu Zuoyi and Xu Yongchang. For all of our troubles with the Shanxi clique, they are the closest thing we have to a vanguard in the northwest. Therefore, we must organise a training mission - including officers, weaponry, and other equipment get them up to par. The fraternal bonds developed between our armies and theirs will hopefully never be forgotten."

 SHX_QIE_assert_our_dominance: "Assert Our Dominance"
 SHX_QIE_assert_our_dominance_desc: "Even if we are forced to tolerate this warlord situation, that does not mean we ought to completely leave these strongmen to their own devices. That would be inviting trouble, akin to showing weakness. Indeed, every so often our \"Governors\" need to be reminded of their place, but forceful means are not always optimal. Therefore, we shall be more cunning, though no less deliberate in our message. A \"regulatory\" inspection by our ministries is in order, sent to Taiyuan to ensure they are compliant with the laws of the land. Though they may grit and gnash their teeth, there is little they can do about it."

 SHX_QIE_promote_chinese_unity: "Promote Chinese Unity"
 SHX_QIE_promote_chinese_unity_desc: "Despite all the division and all the fighting the Warlord Era has brought, there is little disputing that there is but one China and that the ultimate goal in all of this will be a nation reborn. These nationalist thoughts permeate the intellectual class, the military, and even down to the lowliest peasant. Therefore, in face of the rising tide of Japanese aggression to the East, including their lapdog proxies in Fengtian, it is imperative that we remind all of the essentialness of defending our homeland from foreign invaders. With a small push on our part, we can easily stir up anti-imperialistic fervour among the people in Shanxi."

 SHX_QIE_prop_up_yan: "Support Yan Xishan's Government"
 SHX_QIE_prop_up_yan_desc: "Yan Xishan claims to be a political survivor, and perhaps his decades-long rule since 1911 is evidence of that fact. But now more than ever, it seems that Yan is struggling to contain the power of the Guominjun, a tempest he brought upon himself when he first allowed the Guominjun to hole up in his domain rather than allow us to destroy them. But alas, we have no choice but to prop up his decadent government, keeping the commercial clans and gentry aligned with him as well as whatever members of the intelligentsia we can rally. Our generous line of credit and support for his doddering provincial army certainly doesn't hurt either."

 SHX_QIE_commission_order: "Commission Order from Taiyuan Arsenal"
 SHX_QIE_commission_order_desc: "With the shadow of war hovering over China, it is imperative that we secure multiple defence manufacturing contracts across the land to supply the Central Army with necessary provisions as we near the eve of potential conflict. Taiyuan arsenal, one of the largest in Northern China and capable of producing western style artillery, rifles and grenades, must be conscripted into this effort rather than serve as the showpiece of another pompous strongman. Therefore, a series of orders for critical parts and weapons will be placed in the hands of the arsenal, churning out what we need to defend the nation. As a side effect, this will hopefully keep these arms out of the hands of our disloyal \"allies\" in Taiyuan."

 SHX_QIE_secure_favorable_trade_deal: "Secure Favourable Trade Deal"
 SHX_QIE_secure_favorable_trade_deal_desc: "Shanxi is home to a large reservoir of high-quality coal, which can be extracted at very cheap costs in large quantities. However, this has long been overshadowed by coal dug out in Shandong and Hubei thanks to the massive inefficiencies caused by Yan's inept management. With Shandong vulnerable to foreign threats and recently destabilised, it is vital that we secure a source of coal from the interior. That being said, we cannot trust Shanxi's corrupt leadership with managing this trade, so asserting greater control over this line of trade is vital for our future security."

 #Power Struggle Decisions
 SHX_xishan_fuxiang_power_struggle: "[SHX_struggle_for_shanxi_title_defined_text]"
 SHX_xishan_fuxiang_power_struggle_desc: "[SHX_struggle_for_shanxi_desc_defined_text]"

 SHX_sfs_active_title_key: "The Struggle for Shanxi"
 SHX_sfs_inactive_title_key: "The Ten Year Plan Continues"

 SHX_sfs_active_desc_key: "Ever since the retreat of the Guominjun to Shanxi, Governor Yan Xishan and Marshal Feng Yuxiang have banded together against mutual threats in the north. Yan's power has traditionally been with §Pthe provincial government§!, as the centre of a delicate web of various entrenched interests. Feng stakes his power in §ahis control of the powerful Guominjun§!, a nationalist and revolutionary army noted for its fanatical zeal.\n\nBoth men are proud leaders with a distinct vision for how Shanxi should be run. Shanxi is a poor province, with few resources and little time to accommodate even one agenda for its future. The previously lethargic §YTen Year plan§! has suddenly attracted considerable attention from both parties as they seek to bolster their legitimacy.\n\nTo win the struggle for Shanxi, one should push the §Ybalance of power to 100% on either side§!. Ending the struggle early by purging the Guominjun or allowing the timer to run out §Rwill affect stability§! proportionate to the distance the current metre is from 100%.\n\n§CThe Guominjun's power is currently: [SHX.GMJ_coup_strength].§!"
 SHX_sfs_inactive_desc_key: "The end of Shanxi's power struggle has not yet brought the Ten Year Plan to its conclusion. Although initially designed as a means of peaceful economic development and a means of counterbalancing the stronger factions in China's north, it has taken new life following the collapse of the League. Having rallied under [SHX.GetLeader], the Ten Year Plan is integral to his plans for maintaining his hold and also potentially contesting national leadership. To this end, the reshuffled government and people of [SHX.GetNameDef] work tirelessly to execute [SHX.GetLeader]'s vision for the future, hoping to demonstrate his wisdom as an enlightened ruler and set an example for other provinces to follow. Whether or not Shanxi can truly live up to its reputation as a \"Model Province\" however, will ultimately be determined not simply by the direction of its Governor but by the will and sacrifices of its people."

 SHX_looming_gmj_coup: "Looming Guominjun Coup"
 SHX_looming_gmj_coup_desc: "Ever since Feng Yuxiang had his falling out with Yan Xishan, the old Yan-Feng diarchy has begun to teeter. The Guominjun is reported to have set up camp in Shaanxi, and while the two men continue to communicate on matters of provincial administration, all can see the writing on the wall. Feng is clearly beginning to organise his previously dormant revolutionary army, moving aggressively to garner support across the region. A revolution, or perhaps a coup is imminent as the two fight for control of the final implementation of the Ten Year Plan.\n\n§RIf this timer runs out, the Guominjun will successfully overthrow Yan's government and establish their own. Various focuses, decisions and events will allow you to extend or shorten this timer.§!"

 SHX_purge_the_gmj: "Purge the Guominjun"
 SHX_purge_the_gmj_desc: "Ever since Feng Yuxiang had his falling out with Yan Xishan, the old Yan-Feng diarchy has begun to teeter. The Guominjun is reported to have set up camp in Shaanxi, and while the two men continue to communicate on matters of provincial administration, all can see the writing on the wall. Yan's bureaucracy has been unusually animated, solving problems with gusto and churning out propaganda for their master in Shanxi. It is clear that Feng's gamble is beginning to fail: his control of Shaanxi is slipping and the peasants are beginning to turn against him. One decisive strike by Yan and his loyalists will eliminate the Guominjun threat once and for all!"

 SHX_hoard_wealth: "Hoard Wealth"
 SHX_hoard_wealth_desc: "Money is power, and like many warlords in China Yan is well known for his ability to amass a large fortune through various means both scrupulous and unscrupulous. It is only fitting that Shanxi, often stereotyped for its shrewd and greedy people, has a governor known for his cunning. As various officials present their opulent gifts of various origins, Yan's immense fortune grows - as does the resentment of the people."

 SHX_lavish_donations: "Lavish Donations"
 SHX_lavish_donations_desc: "Despite living in a grandiose palace and engaging in large-scale corruption, that does not prevent Yan from cultivating a genial image of generosity. His avarice is tempered by regular public donations towards welfare programmes, and his accessibility to the people: commoners frequently come to him asking for small loans and Yan travels across the province to shake hands with village leaders and distribute pastries to the locals."

 SHX_beijing_bribes: "Beijing Bribes"
 SHX_beijing_bribes_desc: "It is no secret that agents from Beijing have frequently come to Shanxi, whether sent from the central government or from a corporate board. These men come bearing tremendous gifts, however, they risk compromising our delicate patronage network as they threaten to outbid even the governor with their funding!"

 SHX_crackdown_foreign_agitators: "Crackdown on Foreign Agitators"
 SHX_crackdown_foreign_agitators_desc: "Periodic cleanups are necessary in order to protect Shanxi from those who plot from afar. While much of the provincial administration is taking bribes one way or another, a series of targeted raids against those who have taken money from the wrong type of outsider will send a clear message about loyalty!"

 #Education Decisions
 SHX_educational_reform_mission_timer: "Shanxi's Educational Reform Progress"
 SHX_educational_reform_mission_timer_desc: "Shanxi is undergoing monumental changes to its education system across the province. The decisions the government makes throughout this process may accelerate or stall this progress, but Shanxi will not be able to complete the \"A New Intelligentsia\" focus until this timer is complete."

 Yan_taking_cultivate_foreign_aid_connections: "Utilise Foreign Aid Connections"

 SHX_reinforce_primary_school: "Reinforce Primary Schools"
 SHX_reinforce_primary_school_desc: "We must supplement our current academic programmes with a series of other youth programmes. Modelled after our \"Schools for Sons of Military Officers\" and \"Nourish Virtue Schools for Girls\", sports and athletics ought to be a core element of our curriculum along with singing and religious studies. For the underserved, nurseries will care for unwanted (often illegitimate) children as well as orphans from China's years of war, who would otherwise be abandoned and left to suffer. Older children ought to be sent to orphanages to receive a primary education as well as be taught relevant skills to learn a trade. Perhaps we shall even revive the old \"schools for the masses\" implemented by the Guominjun in Zhangjiakou, with roving bands of children being taught in the street by government officials to help crack down on illiteracy."

 SHX_increase_school_taxes: "Increasing School Taxes"
 SHX_increase_school_taxes_desc: "Shanxi historically has utilised local taxes to fund schools, which has helped bridge the divide between the haves and have-nots. That being said, funding remains rather short in our province and more must be done. A new fund must be established to pay for our expansions in education, and clever taxation schemes with it. Billboard taxes, levies on imports, special taxes on grain and wool, load taxes, high taxes on cigarettes, and taxes placed on foreign shops. All of these are bound to create some resentment, but our men will take care to ensure that they are enforced. After all, it is for the good of the children!"

 SHX_clamp_traditional_roles: "Clamp Down on Traditional Roles"
 SHX_clamp_traditional_roles_desc: "Although great strides have been made towards women's equality, Shanxi remains a deeply conservative province. Women's footbinding was only recently fully abolished across the province, and many women remain restricted to domestic roles - expected to make the most out of the family's income and keep the household tidy and self-sufficient. All of this must change, and a greater effort towards organising women via their various organisations and convincing them to the workforce is the only way for the Ten Year Plan to truly modernise Shanxi."

 SHX_womens_college: "Women's College Education"
 SHX_womens_college_desc: "The history of women's education in Shanxi was a difficult one. Although Governor Yan was a proponent of allowing women to attend primary schooling, he did not feel it necessary for them to attend any further classes on the grounds it was not needed to run a household. It was only after major protests that he relented to allowing women to attend colleges, where a few fortunate ones were able to learn alongside men. All of this has been changing rapidly with the resumption of the Ten Year Plan. The Women's Vocational Factory in Taiyuan has seen a swelling of students learning trade skills such as spinning, weaving and writing, though many clamour for more. The Shanxi government as a whole is reversing its stand on women's education, wanting more workers to supply its new factories and shops. Indeed, many credit the successes of socialist states with the emancipation of women, though Shanxi has a long way to go to achieve true equality."

 SHX_eliminate_academic_corruption: "Eliminating Academic Corruption"
 SHX_eliminate_academic_corruption_desc: "Teaching salaries in Shanxi are famously low, with many of Shanxi's brightest electing to join the (themselves underpaid) bureaucracy rather than be one of Shanxi's many neglected school teachers. The result is massive corruption, with teachers and professors regularly engaging in vices such as gambling, extorting parents, selling exam answers, stealing equipment and often simply not attending class. Raising salaries, greater scrutiny and an increase in spirit are vital if we are to modernise provincial education."

 SHX_cultivate_youthful_elite: "Cultivate the Youthful Elite"
 SHX_cultivate_youthful_elite_desc: "A generation ago, many students in Shanxi went abroad to study and came back with radical, foolish ideas from overseas. They were spoiled and lazy and as a result, these study-abroad programmes were largely cancelled. The provincial government has aimed to create a new elite of humble origin loyal to the ideas of the Governor and willing to engage in reasonable changes. Led by Yan's young nephew Liang Huazhi, this new vanguard shall lead Shanxi to its future!"

 SHX_cultivate_foreign_aid_connections: "Utilise Foreign Aid Connections"
 SHX_cultivate_foreign_aid_connections_desc: "Foreign aid has been vital to our province, and Westerners, as well as western-trained Chinese, have been vital to modernising our province. John Dewey for example is a man credited as one of the inspirations for Shanxi's initial efforts at public educational reforms.\n\nWe should tap into what connections we still can, working with them to help fund our efforts, train our staff and maintain a good international profile. Furthermore, it is vital that we take some time to introspect and learn from these foreigners, ridding China's intellectuals of their outdated beliefs that history, philosophy, art and Confucian literature are the only subjects worth studying. In the end, the bulk of our efforts are our own but there is no shame in learning from others."

 SHX_expand_research_Beijing: "Academic Cooperation with Beijing"
 SHX_expand_research_Beijing_desc: "It was a great point of pride when James Yen visited our province to review our educational progress at the start of the Ten Year Plan in 1933 and 1935. This marked the high point of our limited, but still-existent relationship with the central government's educational establishment. Both Zhao Pilian and especially Ren Zhigong stress that this partnership could be so much more, and if the scholars at Shanxi university could connect with those of the big three northern schools of Nankai, Peking, and Tsinghua Universities, Shanxi University could soon be a peer. This dream appears far off, but with great determination and generous funding, the sky seems to be the limit."

 SHX_distribute_research_grants: "Distribute Research Grants"
 SHX_distribute_research_grants_desc: "Perhaps the most telling sign about the progress we have made in our education reforms is our ability to contribute to the broader academic conversation in Northern China. Although perhaps not quite on par with their peers in Beijing, Taiyuan University has been overhauled with the necessary infrastructure to produce advanced scientific, engineering, and industrial research. All they need is a little push, and through some additional funding and grants we can go a long way in improving their output."

 #Agriculture Decisions

 SHX_agricultural_reform_mission_timer_desc: "Shanxi is undergoing monumental changes to land distribution across the province.

 SHX_increase_taxes: "Strengthen the Nation by Enriching the Country"
 SHX_increase_taxes_desc: "Securing a larger share of the agricultural surplus is absolutely essential if we are to fund the necessary reforms for our province. With our new slogan, we shall begin a campaign to encourage further contributions to our provincial effort, taking aim in particular at the ill-gotten gains of the gentry. Pawnshops and other forms of usury will be heavily taxed, and land taxes shall be reformed to target the rich before the poor. They might not like it, but it is better this way than a full-scale revolution!"

 SHX_maintain_countryside: "Keep Balance in the Countryside"
 SHX_maintain_countryside_desc: "Shanxi's rural society is a delicate one, with resentment brewing among the peasants. The only appropriate solution then is to create a more just system.\n\nFor one, taxes to village and district governments must be lowered - they are three times as high as the land tax and in any case village governments and finance bureaus are usually in the pocket of the gentry. Some even say the gentry deliberately hire ruffians to raid other towns to justify raising taxes under the guise of hiring local defence.\n\nWe will demand annual budgets and implement regular audits, which shall help alleviate some of the burdens placed on the peasants. In addition, further policing and government presence will help ensure that security and order are kept - forestalling any rural revolt.\n\nUnlike the socialist radicals in Yan'an, we will properly compensate the landowners. The value of land in the province has declined by nearly 80% due to Black Monday, and we shall offer landlords noninterest-bearing bonds that meet them in the middle - worth 50% more than their real worth.\n\nAlthough it may create grumbles from radicals and reactionaries, it is this careful balancing act that will keep our province safe and productive."

 SHX_litigation: "Council for the Prevention of Litigation"
 SHX_litigation_desc: "One of the more frequent abuses done by the gentry is their utilisation of their superior resources to delay the resolution of cases at the courts, wearing out poor litigants' ability to afford lawyers. It is this kind of behaviour that has severely diminished the peasantry's faith in the government and traditional means of justice, and it is something that must be stopped if we are to keep the people's favour. Previous efforts have included moving lawsuits from the purview of local officials to formalised courts, but that too has had its flaws - with judges being accused of preferring to demonstrate their skill at abstract reasoning over dispensing actual justice. We shall instead continue to expand upon previous efforts to create a six-man \"Council for the Prevention of Litigation\" in each village, elected to membership by the villagers themselves. These councils will try to arbitrate any dispute or grievance before it is appealed to a court or a magistrate. They have already demonstrated some success in the 1920s, and it is high time that they be fully implemented across the province."

 SHX_limited_nationalisation: "Limited Nationalisation"
 SHX_limited_nationalisation_desc: "We have already implemented dozens of programmes hoping to mobilise the common people towards our cause, but it is time that we begin to make concrete efforts at bringing under our control the arable land in Shanxi.\n\nTaught and indoctrinated towards our values at the Training Academy and the Institute of Political Administration, a new corps of district magistrates are to be given unprecedented authority over the villages. With powers such as presiding over village headsmen, removing undesirable village officials, and regular reports to Taiyuan, these new corps of magistrates will be rotated less frequently to make them less dependent on the locals for advice.\n\nSimilarly, the Association for the Promotion of Statistical Investigation of the Economies and Societies of Shanxi have aided us in publishing annually hundreds of pages of statistics on nearly every facet of life in Shanxi. This will allow our magistrates to begin a campaign of targeted nationalisation of mismanaged land while avoiding any politically expensive pitfalls that might threaten to provoke a larger reaction than we've already caused."

 SHX_intimidate_landlords: "Intimidate Landlords"
 SHX_intimidate_landlords_desc: "In response to our efforts to improve the land situation in Shanxi, many members of the gentry have utilised a variety of dirty tricks to block our efforts. These include staging protests, or ignoring our laws, bribing administrators and even hiring ruffians to attack our magistrates. It is time we lay down the law - our own militias and agitators will be deployed to the villages as a show of strength and persistently disloyal landlords will be ejected from their properties. This policy will no doubt spell some trouble, but it is important that we show we are prepared for real change and we truly stand for the common people!"

 SHX_peasant_cooperatives: "Form Peasant Cooperatives"
 SHX_peasant_cooperatives_desc: "The idea of a peasant cooperative is not new, even within Shanxi, and within the confines of the Ten Year Plan many other industries have been pushed to form cooperatives. For farming, however, this is the only practical way in many cases for land to be divided - as an even split often creates plots too small to support a family.\n\nIt also better accounts for shifts in population and allows for easier government oversight and management, which will greatly enhance our efforts to rebuild the countryside and make more room for further planting. This policy is bound to attract accusations of socialism, and turn many previously fence-sitting gentrymen against the government, but will also be popular among the commoners!"

 SHX_unfair_rent: "End Unfair Rent"
 SHX_unfair_rent_desc: "A salient characteristic of much of Shanxi's economic system is the ability of the few with wealth and education to exploit the majority, and their ability to ignore the suffering around them. No truer is this fact than in land rents, where tenant farmers are charged exorbitant fees and interest - keeping a system of de facto feudalism. This problem is heavily localised in central Shanxi, near Taiyuan, as for much of the province peasants own all the land they cultivate or are at least semi-independent. But that is of little solace to the unfortunate many that live in overpopulated regions, with a stagnant economy that forces them to compete with one another for decreasing returns. Putting a stop to these abuses is a strict priority - the government will implement a series of rent controls on cultivated land capping it at around 10% (from over 66%), allowing the tiller to keep most of what they grow."

 SHX_land_to_villages: "All Land to the Villages"
 SHX_land_to_villages_desc: "In the 1920s, Governor Yan mused about having all land be turned in to the government, who would then distribute it more equally among those cultivating it. This idea was revived at the start of the Ten Year Plan, partially buoyed by the arrival of the Guominjun.\n\nWhile it attracted considerable attention at the time, nationalising and redistributing all farmland around Shanxi, that has since faded as little has come of it. It is time for that to change, as we begin a renewed push to buy out land held by the gentry and distribute it to the peasants in a more equitable arrangement. Where there is resistance, will be targeted by a militarised effort to sweep the land to seize large and absentee landholdings from rebellious gentrymen.\n\nIt is in this way that we will make a lasting impression on the countryside, freeing Shanxi of the shackles of an outdated system."

 SHX_cheap_credit: "Cheap Credit and Fertiliser"
 SHX_cheap_credit_desc: "Farming is a very difficult profession, with the farmer being often forced to go into debt at the start of the year purchasing essential modern equipment such as fertiliser and forced to hope that the harvest will be sufficient to offset that debt at the end of the year. As a result, it is very easy for farmers to end up in chronic debt, especially after a string of poor harvests like that currently afflicting Shanxi.\n\nThe Land Reclamation Bank must be given more capital to loan out at cheap rates to help alleviate the burdens placed on our farmers. They will also be authorised to sell crop insurance, making farming a far more secure trade for the yeoman than in previous decades. This will protect them from having to turn to the harsh rates set by the gentry, which often borders (if not is outright) usury.\n\nSimilarly, a fertiliser plant must be erected, and production subsidised. This will help cut prices for our farmers, and hopefully increase output in the future"

 SHX_water_control: "Water Control and Reforestation Measures"
 SHX_water_control_desc: "Water control has had a long history in Shanxi, and was one of the star reforms of Yan Xishan's early administration. Shanxi's rainfall has historically been extremely uneven and concentrated in the summer, so the Bureau of Water Control was formed with trained technocrats to build new irrigation canals and rent new machinery to the peasants to tap into the reservoirs. A parallel effort by the semi-official Society for the Promotion of Forestation was tasked with planting seedlings to help prevent soil erosion and flash floods. These efforts... while impressive in theory have often not panned out in practice. Many peasants cannot actually afford to rent the machinery offered by the Bureau and in any case, river irrigation efforts often fell short due to Shanxi's reliance on earthen dams that disintegrated each year. The trees are often left unmaintained with the exception of those built on highways - meant to show off rather than be practical.\n\nBuilding a modern Shanxi will require us to invest in modern masonry dams with check gates as well as hire sufficient foreign (and expensive) trained technicians to actually maintain hydraulic data to begin our renewed programme of water conservation."

 SHX_connect_yanan: "Rail and Roads to Shanxi"
 SHX_connect_yanan_desc: "Having developed our rural infrastructure and expanded crop yields, it is now vital that we have a means of transporting these goods to market.\n\nIn the 1920s, as a response to failures in distributing famine relief aid due to poor motor infrastructure, Yan Xishan put his army to work building a network of motor roads connecting Taiyuan with all of its provinces. This drastically reduced the travel time across the province, and when famine struck in 1929 it was considerably less devastating than the one a decade prior. It also helped to a slight degree, broaden Shanxi's peasants' horizons and attracted the favour of the Red Cross and China International Famine Relief Commission.\n\nBut little economic benefit has been drawn so far from these roads despite conventional wisdom. Since they were built as cheaply and quickly as possible, many were left unsurfaced and combined with Yan's decree that they be maintained and upkeeped locally, most of these roads have been either washed away or overgrown by weeds. As a result, many of these roads are now useless and the ones that aren't are so highly taxed that few use them for commercial purposes. In fact, camels and rickshaws are more popular than trucks and many roads come to an end at the borders of Shanxi province - unconnected with the rest of China.\n\nIf we want our roads and rail lines to be used for anything other than military purposes, then we must invest in redeveloping our existing infrastructure and fostering domestic trade."

 SHX_upgrade_telecommunications: "Expand Telecommunications"
 SHX_upgrade_telecommunications_desc: "Telecommunications is another stride Shanxi has made over the years, with the Military Telegraph Bureau having installed a series of military telephones that helped suppress banditry in the province during the early part of Yan's reign. This telephone network was expanded in the 1920s, allowing for ready communications with the districts, though for the most part is still only used by the military and government. Further efforts should be made to develop Shanxi's telecommunication network both internally and to the rest of the nation, better connecting us and building the infrastructure needed for industrialisation. A similar project underway is the creation of a weather forecasting service that allows us to better prepare for adverse weather conditions and study Shanxi's climate. Although perhaps not the first priority one may think of when developing Shanxi's agricultural sector, these two investments in the long run are critical if we are to achieve true modernity."

 SHX_sell_shanxi_cotton: "Sell Shanxi Cotton"
 SHX_sell_shanxi_cotton_desc: "Thanks to the greater agricultural output of our province, we are able to supply greater quantities of our valuable cash crops, particularly cotton. These exports allow us to increase the amount of money flowing into our province, money that can be used to further other projects around Shanxi."

Made up of activists aligned with our cause, they will promote the long-held narrative that buying foreign goods are unpatriotic and the only way to strengthen China is for it to live itself up.

Using favourable loans to the population and taking care to keep inflation in check, we shall build Shanxi's economy from within. We will use Shanxi's money for Shanxi's people in other words - and if necessary we will also repudiate any unbacked currency and loans made to exploitative outsiders prior to 1930.\n\nTo buttress this effort, we must also secure our hold on the lucrative salt trade using our newly created North Shanxi Salt Industry Bank. Our people will be encouraged to utilise less salt, allowing us to sell more to outsiders to reverse our trade deficit. In addition, the salt merchants in our province must be kept on a tight leash, preventing needless excesses and ensuring they do not cheat taxes.\n\nOn that topic - we will be taking control of salt taxation. This is a prerogative usually reserved for the central government, but what have they done for us as of late? It won't be easy, but the people of Shanxi deserve a stable financial system and help not scorn from its bankers."

This agency will license imports into our province, taking care to keep out unwanted foreign commodities that may unfairly compete with the honest work done by Shanxi's industrial works. Perhaps also controversially, this will also apply to products produced within China's borders outside of our controlled territories.

 SHX_reinforce_bank_of_SHX: "Reinforce the Bank of Shanxi"
 SHX_reinforce_bank_of_SHX_desc: "The semi-official Provincial Bank of Shanxi was historically one of the cornerstones of Yan Xishan and the Shanxi administration's power, controlling effectively all of the banking and commerce in the province. Despite being personally profitable, there are rampant fears about the stability and quality of currency in the province - at least in part due to constant wars and military spending by the Shanxi government. Efforts to back up the currency with capital have usually resulted in runs on the bank, which frequently force the bank to renege on their promises. Perhaps as a result, branch offices appear deliberately located in obscure and inaccessible places to prevent exchanging bank notes. All of this needs to change, however, if a modern economy is to be established. With an influx of foreign capital, we can at last try to back up our currency and moreover hold currency reserves from the central government and foreign governments as well. The central bank has also been attempting to establish a provincial branch office, something that should be monitored but could provide some further stability in our province. All in all, reinforcing our banking sector will set a groundwork for economic development ahead."

 SHX_wave_of_capital: "Riding the Wave of Capital"

Investors have been looking into building new sugar and rayon factories, as well as dams and powerplants to supply the booming industrialisation going on in Taiyuan. As if a sign of the confidence many have in our city, two leading insurance companies have set up new branches in Taiyuan, offering a glimpse into a modern future for the city. We need to take the fullest advantage of this trend, making sure that the fruits of these projects last for generations to come. However, we must be wary that this sudden influx of new elites does not upend the old ones."

Therefore, taking advantage of a host of prospective buyers looking for a moderately safe investment (by Chinese standards at least), we shall begin to privatise this previously state-owned bank and allow its new owners to set their own agenda. This will reduce our logistical footprint and hopefully bring about the needed capital to develop Shanxi's railways."

 SHX_modernizing_industry_equipment: "Modernising Industrial Equipment"
 SHX_modernizing_industry_equipment_desc: "Building a new Shanxi economy is not merely a matter of acquiring modern tools and machines, though that definitely helps. It is also about training the locals in modern techniques, building new supply chains, and educating new managers. The Japanese not too long ago did something similar, helping them leapfrog from a languishing secondary power in Asia to one of the world powers that could challenge even the West.\n\nYan Xishan has long theorised of the need for \"scientific management\" of industry, eliminating the corruption and nepotism that has festered in our isolation. As protectionism declines, we must encourage our business community to rise to the challenge. If necessary, forced mergers will be used to maximise production and prune out the weak branches. By asking them to embrace new methods and take on new partners, we begin a process that may not be pretty initially but in the long run, the competition will clean out the lazy and inefficient. In its place will be a modern, competitive and reborn economy fit for our model province."

Despite the superficial acquiescence of the laobaixing to the grand projects of its strongmen, they still expect to benefit in return. A distant and violent war will very much destabilise the foundation in which [SHX.GetNameDef] has built its power, showing that its mandate to rule may not be as strong as they think. Beware the perception that your goals do not outstrip your ability to achieve them, lest your megalomania becomes your downfall.\n\nFrom now until our successful unification of the country we must be wary of seeing our war support bottom out. Unlike other warlords, Shanxi simply does not have the resources for a protracted war, and [SHX.GetLeader] has effectively staked everything possible into a short, decisive conflict that will see him on top. If he fails to unify the nation in the eyes of the people, then they shall soon find another champion to do so instead.\n\nNote that, even if we are able to muster a peace, the die has already been cast.

 SHX_send_scouts_against_shanxi_desc: "Although we are intimately familiar with our own lands, it is too early to shrink from our necessary duties at intelligence gathering. Sending scouts and collecting reports from spies on their side of the border is integral to knowing what [SHX.GetLeader] intends to bring against us, thereby giving us a critical advantage in preparing our defences."
 SHX_prepare_hui_provisional_leaders: "Prepare Hui Provisional Leaders"
 SHX_prepare_hui_provisional_leaders_desc: "Driven out of in a crushing rout and seeing their massive landholdings confiscated by Mongol and Tibetan authorities, quite a few of the Hui gentry were eager to join our cause in hopes of being restored to their old estates. With some effort, we can rally entire clans behind this cause and greatly strengthen our ability to administer the distant areas we pass through."

 SHX_suiyuan_gather_supplies_desc: "\"An army without its baggage-train is lost, without provisions it is lost, without bases of supply it is lost\"\nOur men can only march so far, fight so long, and fire so many shells as we can reasonably supply. It may take a few distinct initiatives and considerable financial investment, but we will ensure that our baggage train is adequately prepared for a grinding conflict.!"
 SHX_suiyuan_decisive_first_strike_decision: "Prepare a Decisive First Strike"
 SHX_suiyuan_decisive_first_strike_decision_desc: "The very first few weeks of a conflict is perhaps the most vital for shaping the conflict yet to come. It is at that time the fog of war is first lifted, with bluffs being exposed and the armies' mettle being tested. Preparing our men to be at their finest at the opening salvo will give us a unique chance to eliminate our foes in their early positions, hopefully preventing a stalemate. Be warned, however, that such an aggressive opening will probably tire out our population, so we better make it worth it."
 SHX_suiyuan_begin_northwestern_expedition: "Begin Northwestern Expedition"
 SHX_suiyuan_begin_northwestern_expedition_desc: "It is time. Now, or never. With sappers and skirmishers having already begun fighting along our ever-loose border, we can no longer afford to wait. An order shall be sent from [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] down to the regional headquarters and towards our divisions until every soldier knows: we march towards the sunset - to death or glory!."
 SHX_xibei_offer_early_peace: "Offer Peace Terms"
 SHX_xibei_offer_early_peace_desc: "Having occupied all that we set out to occupy and smashed enemy troops wherever we found them, [SHX.GetLeader] feels it is appropriate to offer terms for peace to our vanquished foes. There is little point chasing our enemies into their core lands, and we must conserve our resources for other conflicts we must attend to."
 SHX_suiyuan_raid_SHX_supply_bases_decision: "Raid [SHX.GetAdjective] Supply Bases"
 SHX_suiyuan_raid_SHX_supply_bases_decision_desc: "In order to prepare for their unjust campaign against us, the [SHX.GetName] have begun preparing supply bases along the border. The lack of suitable roads and tracks needed to support such an extensive operation means that many are built extremely close to our territory, leaving them ripe for raids by our cavalry and light infantry. Torching these bases and stealing their supplies will greatly diminish their ability to wage a protracted conflict."
 SHX_suiyuan_fortify_frontier_decision: "Fortify the Northwestern Frontier"
 SHX_suiyuan_fortify_frontier_decision_desc: "With few roads and rugged (sometimes uninhabitable) terrain, a major advantage we possess is the limited attack vectors our [SHX.GetAdjective] opponents possess if they wish to seize their objectives. Building blockhouses, bunkers, and trenches along key positions will give us a crucial advantage in dislodging their assaults and will help delay their advance until their supplies run out."
 SHX_suiyuan_rally_local_supporters_decision: "Rally Local Supporters"
 SHX_suiyuan_rally_local_supporters_decision_desc: "It is not enough to simply amass our armies and other semi-professional levies against the advancing [SHX.GetAdjective] army. We need to mobilise our entire population against the coming foe, establishing a network of militias, informants, and informal supply bases to help slow down enemy advances. This defence in depth will make any assault into our core lands unsustainable, and maximise our home-field advantage."
 SHX_suiyuan_invite_farmers_to_suiyuan_decision: "Invite Farmers to Suiyuan"
 SHX_suiyuan_invite_farmers_to_suiyuan_decision_desc: "Suiyuan is home to extremely rich soil thanks to the Yellow River, which had historically attracted the attention of both Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang. Crops grown in Suiyuan had previously disrupted Shanxi domestic production, leading to Yan arguing that the provinces were \"mutually dependent\". Feng for his part wanted to settle the region in five years, inviting poor tenant farmers from across China to settle the region and be provided with free irrigation and other tools.\n\nNow that we have obtained Suiyuan we can begin a programme to develop the land for agriculture. With nearly 4,000 acres of previously untilled land, we can distribute it to ex-soldiers of our armies as a form of quasi-retirement. They will however continue to train under retired army officers, maintaining constant collective vigilance.\n\nWe must be careful, however, that our efforts do not anger the local Mongol population."
 SHX_suiyuan_tapping_into_the_riches_of_suiyuan_decision: "Tapping into the Riches of Suiyuan"
 SHX_suiyuan_tapping_into_the_riches_of_suiyuan_decision_desc: "Suiyuan is of particular value to us because both Suiyuan and Chahar have about three times as much iron as Shanxi and probably more than any Chinese province south of the Great Wall. This would greatly enhance our existing iron and coal infrastructure and help fuel our industries. Suiyuan is also home to extensive coal deposits that we can exploit, further cornering this crucial market. Given all the sacrifices we have paid acquiring this land, should we not use it to its fullest potential?"
 SHX_suiyuan_building_the_russian_connection_decision: "Building the Russian Connection"
 SHX_suiyuan_building_the_russian_connection_decision_desc: "One of the lesser known but no less important benefits of acquiring access to inner Mongolia is our greater potential to seek outside aid independent of the oversight of Beijing. Across the cold Northern steppe lies Russia, which has so far been largely indifferent to our plight. While it is too early to seek any official recognition or help, it is not too early to make the most of the black market. Sending agents to establish smuggling networks across Mongolia and other forms of trade licit and illicit may give us an advantage in the common conflicts in China."

 SHX_suiyuan_lay_tracks_to_target_decision_desc: "[FROM.SHX_Get_Tracks_Desc]"
 SHX_suiyuan_lay_tracks_to_lanzhou_decision_desc: "Distant from the rest of China, the Hui lands in Xibei often feel isolated from the goings on of Chinese politics. This has given them a certain aloofness, which has disconnected them from the greater struggle of the nation. One of the first steps towards reversing this provincialism and helping us bring to bear the resources of Xibei (or bringing our resources towards the frontier) is building adequate rail connections to the capital of Gansu at Lanzhou. It will take some resources, but we should be able to get a preliminary set of tracks adequate for military transport."
 SHX_suiyuan_lay_tracks_to_zhangye_decision_desc: "Continuing our efforts to connect ourselves further west into Gansu, we can now create a connection from Gansu to Zhangye. This extends our reach into the depths of the Hexi corridor into the Gobi desert. However tiresome and time-consuming it may be, it will be necessary if we wish to launch any further campaigns to be master of China's west."
 SHX_suiyuan_lay_tracks_to_suiyuan_decision_desc: "Suiyuan is an extremely valuable province for us however most of the rail connections to access it are either under the control of our rivals or at risk of doing so. The importance of these tracks was demonstrated by Feng Yuxiang and his Guominjun's retreat from Beijing through the Beijing-Suiyuan railway (also known as the Peking-Kalgan Railway). A key stop on this track would be at Datong, which was occupied by Zhili forces at the end of the Fourth Zhili-Fengtian war.\n\nTherefore, we must lay a new set of tracks from Taiyuan to Suiyuan. One deeper into Shanxi province and away from the influence of Zhili, Fengtian or even Japanese eyes."

 SHX_Foreign_Policy_decisions_desc: "The treacherous Governor Yan has decided to betray us! Rather than honour our agreements and bring an end to the German imposed monarchy, he has taken upon himself the task of further insulting the principles of Xinhai. If we are to survive, we must strike fast while he is still distracted by the Zhili remnants. With the Xinhai revolutionary spirit still burning in our hearts, we will cast down Yan, his royalist marionettes, and all else who dare to stand in the way of national liberation!"

 ##Shanxi Mining Decisions

 SHX_expand_coal_mines1_decision: "Expand Coal Mining in [1015.GetName]"
 SHX_expand_coal_mines1_decision_desc: "Coal is an essential part of our economy. Shanxi is a province extremely rich in this strategic resource, with high-quality ore and a workforce well adapted for mining. Their budding coal industry historically has been held back by chronic corruption, poor management and a foreign rail monopoly charging exorbitant prices to export coal. We should expand our own mining operations in [1015.GetName] to better harness the resource and enrich ourselves as a province, and thus reduce our reliance on foreign corporations and their equipment."

 SHX_expand_coal_mines2_decision: "Expand Coal Mining in [1072.GetName]"
 SHX_expand_coal_mines2_decision_desc: "Coal is an essential part of our economy.

 SHX_improve_metal_refining1_decision: "Improve Steel Refineries in [1015.GetName]"
 SHX_improve_metal_refining1_decision_desc: "With numerous rivers, large coal mining operations, and access to quality iron ore from the neighbouring provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan, Shanxi is a natural hub for steel production and in the last few decades has experienced a mini-Industrial Revolution of sorts. As the new masters of the province, we should improve our smelting methods so we can refine our metals for a variety of purposes both military and civilian."

 SHX_improve_metal_refining2_decision: "Improve Steel Refineries in [622.GetName]"
 SHX_improve_metal_refining2_decision_desc: "With numerous rivers, large coal mining operations, and access to quality iron ore from the neighbouring provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan, Shanxi is a natural hub for steel production and in the last few decades has experienced a mini-Industrial Revolution of sorts. As the new masters of the province, we should improve our smelting methods so we can refine our metals for a variety of purposes both military and civilian."

 SHX_improve_metal_refining3_decision: "Improve Tungsten Refineries in [622.GetName]"
 SHX_improve_metal_refining3_decision_desc: "Although more famous for their coal and iron industries, veins of tungsten and other strategic metals can be found in the mountains within Shanxi province. It would require some initial capital investment and some allocation of resources, but with some effort, we can quickly tap into the deposits of [622.GetName] to expand our extraction quotas using existing mining infrastructure."

 SHX_further_resource_extraction1_decision: "Further Resource Extraction in [1072.GetName]"
 SHX_further_resource_extraction1_decision_desc: "Historically, much of the resource extraction in Shanxi province has been located in the eastern mountains, a source of tension between the Zhili central and Shanxi provincial governments during the early parts of the 1930s. Nonetheless, as the capital, Taiyuan is the major hub of industrial smelting and refinement and if we are to fully make use of Shanxi's numerous strategic resources it is critical that we develop our industrial infrastructure in the city. Already waiting for us is a rather large series of industrial zone established by Governor Yan, thinly hidden from the sight of Wu Peifu during his \"Ten Year Plan\". If we make the most of it, we can truly integrate the regional economy towards a national purpose."

 SHX_further_resource_extraction2_decision: "Further Resource Extraction in [1015.GetName]"
 SHX_further_resource_extraction2_decision_desc: "Historically, much of the resource extraction in Shanxi province has been located in the eastern mountains, a source of tension between the Zhili central and Shanxi provincial governments during the early parts of the 1930s. The western region is less explored and has been mostly neglected over the years, as the lack of commercially useful rail and automobile road connections stifled industrial growth. This changes now. As we plan for the future, we need to make the most out of Shanxi's resources there. It is only in this way that we secure the future not only of the locals but of our great nation."

 SHX_new_year_old_problems_desc: "Once the home of the mythical Emperor Yao, and the great \"Piaohao\" banking clans of the 1800s, Shanxi has fallen on hard times - perhaps even harder than the rest of China. Although it held great promise during the Xinhai revolution, like the rest of the country things have returned to the way it was; droll and stagnant. Yan negotiates now with the AOG over rail lines, still hoping for something to change."

 SHX_ten_year_plan: "Resume the Ten Year Plan"
 SHX_ten_year_plan_desc: "In 1930, Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang hatched a plan together that would avenge their losses and allow them to march on Beijing in triumph. This Ten Year Plan was to be a multi-pronged, centrally-planned project to radically reform Shanxi into a power base capable of challenging Wu Peifu. As the winds shift, it would appear both men have suddenly taken a renewed interest in this grand project."

#Early Political Tree
 SHX_order_of_lion: "Order of the Vigilant Lion"
 SHX_order_of_lion_desc: "During the chaotic 1900s, bandits once swarmed the land like locusts. To fight back, Governor Yan ordered the formation of the baowei tuan. These village militias, though poorly armed, continue to be recognised for their courage in the form of the Order of the Vigilant Lion. However, with rising political tensions across China, they find renewed purpose guarding Shanxi's hamlets against outside forces..."

 SHX_wealth_and_power: "A Web of Wealth and Power"
 SHX_wealth_and_power_desc: "In the chaos of the warlord era, no one can last long without power - something idealists learned the hard way during the Xinhai revolution. In these so-called warlord states, an intricate web of connections both civilian and military keep the gears turning as any official hierarchy begins to blur. Oiling this machine is money, something Yan Xishan has been careful to hoard - and spend - as he has to."

 SHX_local_democracy: "Nurture Local Democracy"
 SHX_local_democracy_desc: "Democracy, as westerners would understand it, remains more of a pipe dream than anything in China's hinterlands. In Shanxi, a system of local democratic councils was implemented years ago but has turned largely moribund - mostly a tool for the local gentry to entrench their power. Still, as the Guominjun seek an advantage over Yan in the countryside, they must utilise whatever institutional tools they can find."

 SHX_focus_bureaucracy: "Centralise the Bureaucracy"
 SHX_focus_bureaucracy_desc: "It hasn't been easy - building a bureaucracy capable of governing Shanxi. Yan Xishan, in his quest for modernising the province (and cementing his control), has tried for decades to build an efficient governmental apparatus, but has found himself stymied by corruption, poor education, and general apathy by his magistrates. But the wheel must turn, and fast, if he is to defeat the GMJ and other rivals in China."

 SHX_a_higher_purpose: "Look towards a Higher Purpose"
 SHX_a_higher_purpose_desc: "Even in a land as jaded and cynical as a divided China, or as reactionary as Shanxi, there are always dreamers. People who dare to hope for a better future. But Shanxi as of late has become torn between at least two different dreams. Two different ideologies. Two different masters. And all know that Shanxi can hardly even support one. With Yan and Feng's latest falling out, the battle for Shanxi's soul begins."

 SHX_doctrine_of_mean: "The Doctrine of the Mean"
 SHX_doctrine_of_mean_desc: "In order to save China, a moral rehabilitation must occur. That is a doctrine many of China's conservatives have adhered to, and Yan is not alone in his pursuit of harmony and moderation to cast out China's ills of disorder and instability. Yan Xishan has largely turned to neo-Confucian thought in his quest to save his nation. Only through a change in spirit can material changes such as modernisation occur."

 SHX_heart_washing: "Revitalising the Heart Washing Society"
 SHX_heart_washing_desc: "In his quest to revive the Chinese spirit through what amounts to a neo-Confucian church, Yan has established a Heart Washing Society chapter in every town. Gathering prominent figures every Sunday for organised meditation and public confessions of wrong, these rallies proved enthusiastic while Yan kept his attention. Yan's neglect in the 1920s has seen congregations collapse, so a revival proves necessary."

 SHX_peoples_movement: "Lead the Good People's Movement"
 SHX_peoples_movement_desc: "As an extension of the Heart Washing Society, and inspired by Zhao Daiwen and his interpretation of Confucian beliefs, the Good People's movement has emerged to guide Chinese citizens on the right path. Promoting virtues such as honesty, friendship, dignity, diligence, thrift, and (perhaps most importantly) obedience, it is through these values and Yan's paternal hand that China can be saved."

 SHX_knowledge: "What The People Must Know"
 SHX_knowledge_desc: "As part of his effort to promote upright values and impart his profound wisdom, Yan Xishan has published numerous pamphlets and textbooks. Besides the aforementioned textbook, other titles include best sellers such as \"What Families Must Know\", and \"What Village Headmen Must Know\". He has also begun touring the countryside delivering speeches at massive rallies, with thousands coming out to see their wise leader."

 SHX_christian_principles: "Working with Christian Principles"
 SHX_christian_principles_desc: "In his effort to promote a new vision for China, Feng frequently turns to virtues inspired by Christianity. Indeed, he is not alone in this regard - Christian missionaries and other Christians frequently come to Shanxi province to aid the people. While many distrust what they see as a foreign religion and the Guominjun does not require its members to be Christian, few can deny its reach in Shanxi."

 SHX_socialism: "The Allure of Socialism"
 SHX_socialism_desc: "It would not be accurate to call the Guominjun a socialist organisation, despite what their opponents may say. However, the Guominjun's egalitarian ideals often cross paths with other groups who also fight for the laobaixing. Although the reality often does not match up to the Guominjun's lofty ideals, Feng's demands for revolutionary change for the sake of the common people have won the hearts of many."

 SHX_republican_united_front: "Create a Republican United Front"
 SHX_republican_united_front_desc: "Decades ago, when Sun Yat-sen and others toppled the Qing, dreamers throughout China hoped for a new era. Just a few years later, it was betrayed by greedy men who destroyed the republic. Yet people still dream on. Feng frequently includes Dr Sun in his speeches, even as he keeps his distance from the KMT. He has established a Political Department to rally other republicans to his banner."

 SHX_destroy_feudalism: "Destroy the Remnants of Feudalism"
 SHX_destroy_feudalism_desc: "Love the People! Do Not Molest the People! Be Frugal! Marshal Feng and his GMJ have travelled extensively over the years, but they have stood out from bandits because of their discipline and concern for the commoners. New slogans now emerge - Politicise the Army! Eliminate Corrupt Bureaucracy! Stop Only Giving Lip Service to Laws! There is no going back now, the corruption of the old order will be swept away!"

 SHX_nationalism_regionalism: "Conflicting Identities"
 SHX_nationalism_regionalism_desc: "Like many areas in warlord-era China, years of division have created endless mixed messages about nationalism, regional pride, and identity. There is little doubt that Shanxi is an integral part of a greater China, but many are wary of Beijing's intention and are happy with the significant autonomy the region has been given. This protects Shanxi and its leaders, but makes it harder for them to leave it."

 SHX_propaganda_department: "Fund the Propaganda Department"
 SHX_propaganda_department_desc: "If there is one thing that both Governor Yan and Marshal Feng can agree upon, its that it is through the will of the people, guided through the wisdom of its leaders and imbued with a spiritual rebirth, that can create the thunderous change needed to save the nation. Although their titanic clash has stoked division, their extensive investments in propaganda campaigns have rescued Shanxi from the pits of apathy!"

 SHX_our_fate_our_hands: "Our Fate, In Our Hands"
 SHX_our_fate_our_hands_desc: "In spite of everything - the uncertainty, the violence, the sacrifices - Shanxi remains unbowed. We are a proud province, with a great people. And having been rallied behind a great leader we will emerge triumphant against anything the world throws at us. Under [Root.GetLeader], we have nothing to fear in the future ahead - the people are masters of their own destiny!"

#Education Tree
 SHX_review_education: "Revisiting Education in Shanxi"
 SHX_review_education_desc: "A modern Shanxi requires more than simply new machines and laws: it requires trained technicians, experienced managers and competent bureaucrats. Our shortcomings can be traced back to incomplete educational reforms. When Yan Xishan first took power, 99% of the province was illiterate. That number has dropped - but our troubles are far from done. The field of education needs our close attention!"

 SHX_student_negotiations: "Negotiations with the Student Association"
 SHX_student_negotiations_desc: "As we renew our push to reform education in our province, it appears we have ruffled some feathers among the students themselves. Zhao Pilian, the moderate principal of our People's Normal School, shall be tasked with opening up negotiations with the apparent leaders of this nebulous body, and hopefully cool down tempers before they threaten to derail our progress!"

 SHX_parties_and_secret_societies: "Parties and Secret Societies"
 SHX_parties_and_secret_societies_desc: "Just because formal political parties have been banned in Shanxi doesn't mean people with vested interests and various passions have been idle. Indeed, various groups across Shanxi continue to congregate, ignoring the bored indifference of the secret police. The public outburst of the students has reminded Shanxi's leadership of the need to keep tabs on these sometimes illicit organisations."

 SHX_education_for_all: "Prioritising Early Education Access"
 SHX_education_for_all_desc: "The Association in Charge of the Movement for Putting into Effect Mass Education in Shanxi has reawoken from its slumber, empowered by an influx of energised Guominjun-aligned activists. These reformers seek a continuation of Shanxi's old policies of expanding schooling opportunities for the province's destitute countryside, hoping to build a powerful foundation for Shanxi's future prosperity."

 SHX_new_intelligetsia: "A New Intelligentsia"
 SHX_new_intelligetsia_desc: "The final pieces are at last falling into place. With new scholarships being funded and educators at last being trained adequately, a more modern educational system in Shanxi can finally take root. There are plenty of shortcomings in our new system, however, the libraries are funded (and actually attended), students are finally learning useful skills, and a cadre of learned men and women taking form."

 SHX_developing_middle_class: "Developing the Middle Class"
 SHX_developing_middle_class_desc: "The progress being made in both education and agriculture has accelerated progress the Shanxi government has dreamed of for decades: the creation of a new class of urban professionals with money to spend on entrepreneurship and local development. Although many came from already privileged classes such as the rural gentry, plenty have been uplifted from poverty as well."

 SHX_womens_education: "Expanding Women's Education"
 SHX_womens_education_desc: "Not too long ago, women were forced to fight to attend higher education, forming a Women's Association to protect that right. Now, with the increased demands on the province for trained individuals in shops and factories, the government has shifted to encouraging female enrolment - crediting the successes of industrialisation in socialist nations to the emancipation of their women."

 SHX_swords_to_plowshares: "From Swords to Ploughshares"
 SHX_swords_to_plowshares_desc: "Yan, Feng and others have quickly learned since the 1910s the need for post-military vocational training. Soldiers must be taught the necessary skills to support themselves outside of the army, lest they turn to banditry. It shall be decreed that prior to leaving service, all soldiers must learn a trade. Workshops will be established to help teach veterans before they are released from the military."

 SHX_emphasise_higher_education: "Emphasise Higher Education"
 SHX_emphasise_higher_education_desc: "A great deal of effort has already been placed into our famed universal educational programmes, so it is high time that we begin to move on to what our province really needs: expanded technical training in science and engineering. That generation that grew up under our initial reforms shall enjoy the completion of our decade-old promise: that they will live a much better life than their parents."

 SHX_foreign_experts: "Foreign Scientific Expertise"
 SHX_foreign_experts_desc: "Shanxi has long relied on foreigners and foreign-trained Chinese in academia and education. While we are continuing to lessen our dependence on these missionaries and have begun to teach our students closer to home, it is too early to discount the contributions of this class of foreign-taught intellectuals in helping build Shanxi's educational base. They shall be hired to supplement our domestic efforts!"

 SHX_experimental_school_to_village: "The Experimental School for Village Education"
 SHX_experimental_school_to_village_desc: "The Governor is quoted to have said \"Technical education must be acquired on the job, it cannot be gotten simply by reading books\", and that is a principle Shanxi continues to hold. We shall expand our previous experimental school to be a model for education across the province, raising a generation of apprentices - not students - that will serve as the backbone for our future!"

 SHX_model_city_model_province: "A Model City for a Model Province"
 SHX_model_city_model_province_desc: "If the core aim of the Ten Year Plan is to industrialise Shanxi, then the cornerstone of this plan is Taiyuan. Taiyuan is the beating heart of Shanxi's economy, and continuing our plan of aggressive state intervention in the economy is essential to develop a modern economy in the province. Nonetheless, an urgent decision must be made soon about how we will amass the resources for this undertaking."

 SHX_dig_solutions: "Digging a Little Deeper"
 SHX_dig_solutions_desc: "Our future prosperity lies beneath our feet! Having laid the industrial and commercial groundwork, we must also begin to tap into our extensive resource deposits to push our industrial economy forward. Since our trade, industry and mining are all heavily connected, this must be a concerted push. Subsidies in mining, refining infrastructure, light industry - together they feed the fires of development!"

 SHX_shanxi_solutions: "Shanxi Might for Shanxi Problems"
 SHX_shanxi_solutions_desc: "We will industrialise Shanxi using our own sweat and our own ingenuity! Shanxi has for years adopted an autarkic footing, keeping outsiders at arm's length. And we will continue to do so until all of China is liberated. Although it may not always be popular with the business class or the people, we will rally our people to make sacrifices necessary for progress. We will find the resources we need, one way or another..."

 SHX_manage_monopolies: "Manage the Monopolies"
 SHX_manage_monopolies_desc: "As part of Shanxi's \"State Capitalist\" agenda, the provincial government has acquired an impressive array of state-backed monopolies. Although our bureaucracy's technical prowess is not always up to par, we will harness what we can to mobilise the industrial sector of Taiyuan. Banks, factories, companies, mines - if Shanxi marches together we can move mountains!"

 SHX_tongpu_railway_project: "The Tongpu Railway Project"
 SHX_tongpu_railway_project_desc: "To continue our quest to build our economy and reverse the trade deficit, we must connect with the rest of China. Despite generating the cheapest and highest quality coal in China, the exorbitant fees charged by the German-owned Zheng-Dai railroad have made our coal uncompetitive. Breaking this monopoly is the next step to wresting away control of our future from short-sighted foreign capitalists!"

 SHX_seek_outside_capital: "Seeking Outside Capital"
 SHX_seek_outside_capital_desc: "Although Shanxi has proudly carried on for years with minimal help, it is clear that if we are to accomplish our long-planned grand projects, it will not be sufficient to keep squeezing more from our exhausted population. Instead, we must raise capital from outside and use it to lift up our economy. We will use foreign money as a springboard for further development, and with any luck our national liberation."

 SHX_mass_privatization: "Mass Privatisation"
 SHX_mass_privatization_desc: "Significant economic quarters have come under government control over the years, leading to tremendous inefficiency as corrupt and incompetent bureaucrats stifle proper development. Meanwhile, our once-thriving salt, banking and brewing industries have since died. We must again become the heart of China's economy, starting by igniting a commercial revolution to complement our industrial revolution!"

 SHX_beijing_taiyuan_railway: "The Beijing-Taiyuan Railway"
 SHX_beijing_taiyuan_railway_desc: "Our economy has long been choked by limited rails and high fees, no doubt in part due to Germano-Bejing meddling. With our expanded partnerships, we have finally come to an accord that will create new lines to allow for the export of our cheap, quality coal at competitive prices. Although the focus is between Taiyuan and Beijing, smaller connections to Shijiazhuang and Dezhou have been considered too!"

#Agricultural Tree
 SHX_battle_for_countryside: "The Battle for the Countryside"
 SHX_battle_for_countryside_desc: "Shanxi is a province of deep inequality, and nowhere is this more pronounced than the province's rural backlands. Once the primary focus of Yan Xishan's economic initiatives, owing to his Confucian education, the 1930s drive towards industrialisation has left the perennially impoverished countryside further behind. Now, things are beginning to come to a head, as attention returns to the region."

 SHX_gentry_deal: "Deal with the Gentry"
 SHX_gentry_deal_desc: "The gentry of Shanxi have long been a thorn in Yan's efforts at generating meaningful changes to Shanxi's rural sector, and their obstinance is only matched by their ability to keep Yan in power so long as he is willing to cater to their whims. Keeping them pacified is essential for allowing any reforms to be implemented, and we shall start by distributing prestigious scholarships to schools in Taiyuan."

 SHX_control_gentry: "Rein in the Gentry"
 SHX_control_gentry_desc: "Consolidating our hold on the countryside is essential, and to do that the worst excesses of the gentry must be curbed. Model village committeemen shall be deployed to the villages to convince local officials of the need to trust in the administration and put provincial interests first. This will no doubt be a hard sell, but in the end, bringing the villages to heel is necessary for the Ten Year Plan."

 SHX_peasant_deal: "Rally the Peasantry"
 SHX_peasant_deal_desc: "One of Feng's more famous reforms was the creation of the Rural Training institute, which among other things, sought to train the peasants for village leadership. Although not exceptionally successful in 1927, the principle still stands - if there are to be any changes in the province then the peasants must be empowered to take charge of their own destiny, including matters political, cultural and economic."

 SHX_control_peasants: "Sweep the Gentry Aside"
 SHX_control_peasants_desc: "\"Even respectable members of the gentry think it is fashionable to disregard the law, while less reputable elements delight in it!\"\n\nLong have the excess of the wealthy been documented in this province, and yet few have had the courage to stand up to them. This ends now. Aggressive measures must be taken to bring them to heel."

 SHX_land_reform: "Land Reform in Shanxi"
 SHX_land_reform_desc: "It seems that our efforts at land reform have borne fruit, though there remains the need for some finishing touches. The Provincial College of Agriculture and its agricultural experimentation stations require more funding, which will allow for the better circulation of new agricultural techniques. These efforts will, at last, bring about some modern quality of life for the poor farmer."

 SHX_agricultural_investments: "Agricultural Investments"
 SHX_agricultural_investments_desc: "The reason why many of Shanxi's 1920s agricultural projects failed is that we tried to do too much with little planning, stretching resources thin and accomplishing nothing. Efforts at irrigation and water control were haphazard, creating an expensive failure when flooding and erosion killed crops and people alike. We need to rethink our funding priorities if we are to proceed."

 SHX_diversify_crops: "Crop Diversification"
 SHX_diversify_crops_desc: "In the past decade, multiple attempts were made to transition from cereals to cash crops. Quite a few were unsuccessful, but we have found cotton to be quite profitable. Cotton mills such as the privately owned Jinsheng and government-owned Jinghua mills will require some additional investment, but their operations can be expanded and be made competitive with foreign goods flooding into China."

 SHX_economic_restructuring: "Economic Reconstruction"
 SHX_economic_restructuring_desc: "As part of the Ten Year Plan, we shall establish in every village an Economic Reconstruction Committee to draft up annual economic development plans. District planners and then the Central Reconstruction Committee shall use these local plans to create higher-level ones. This will revolutionise the countryside by acting as the spearheads for the economic reconstruction at the village level."

 SHX_weed_out_corruption: "Weed Out Corruption"
 SHX_weed_out_corruption_desc: "A variety of anti-corruption agencies are already in the works. Chief among them are the Village Inspection Committees, which will be tasked with ensuring scrutiny in the implementation of the Ten Year Plan, searching for unenthusiastic or corrupt members of the gentry and administration. Their misdeeds will be publicly shamed in a periodical known as the Supervisorial Weekly."

#Later Ten Year Plan Stuff
 SHX_reverse_the_trade_deficit: "Reverse the Trade Deficit"
 SHX_reverse_the_trade_deficit_desc: "At last we have done it! Although many expected us to fail, and for our Ten Year plan to be yet another abandoned project, it finally bears fruit! Having successfully revitalised our agricultural and mining sectors, built a fledgling industrial centre, and built new rail connections to the outside, the trade imbalance that has long shackled Shanxi's economy is finally turning in our favour."

 SHX_grand_state_project: "A Grand State Project"
 SHX_grand_state_project_desc: "With our light industry humming, our trained workforce coming to life and having amassed some (limited) capital, we need to decide on the capstone for our industrial efforts. A great feat of Shanxi engineering, sure to impress outsiders and be the pinnacle of our people's efforts. Two proposals have been brought forward by the recently formed Northwestern Industrial Company, we shall hear them carefully."

 SHX_model_province: "The Model Province"
 SHX_model_province_desc: "At long last, the legendary Ten-Year Plan comes to a close. Whether it is completed early or late or on time matters little - because the accomplishment is clear for all to see. Shanxi has truly lived up to its nickname, and its governor a heroic figure both near and far. With the sacrifices demanded of the people eased, a sense of normalcy falls across Shanxi. Many wonder what the next decade will bring."

#Military Tree
 SHX_expand_the_xiang_jun: "Expand the Xiang Jun"
 SHX_expand_the_xiang_jun_desc: "In looking towards a model to emulate for Shanxi's armed forces, we shall turn to Yan Xishan's proposal to rely on a professionally trained yet semi-active military force known as the Xiang Jun. Inspired by the American National Guard and the conscription system of Japan, the Xiang Jun will provide Shanxi with well-trained conscripts without the expense of a large military."

 SHX_integrate_irregular_formations: "Integrate Irregular Formations"
 SHX_integrate_irregular_formations_desc: "While irregular troops lack the organisation and morale of professionally trained infantry, they can play a role in scouting, skirmishing, harassing, and supply sabotage - military traits that are extremely helpful in the treacherous terrain of Shanxi province."

 SHX_military_instruction_corps: "The Military Instruction Corps"
 SHX_military_instruction_corps_desc: "A strong army in China is one led by strong and educated men, those who are willing to be an example to their subordinates. To foster a new generation of Shanxi officers, a proposal has been created to expand the Military Instruction Corps. They will be tasked to toughen up and educate recruits about Yan's peculiar ideology to strengthen their resolve and capabilities under fire."

 SHX_study_the_european_war: "Study the European War"
 SHX_study_the_european_war_desc: "Yan Xishan believes that war must be protracted and bloody, and that positional tactics and wars of attrition must be fought in tandem. As such, he has encouraged the study of the First Weltkrieg, taking inspiration from the absolute carnages of Verdun and Tannenberg as models for how wars should be fought in the modern 20th century."

 SHX_adopt_new_rifle_grenades: "Adopt New Rifle Grenades"
 SHX_adopt_new_rifle_grenades_desc: "While grenades are commonplace among the many warlord armies of China, equipping our soldiers with rifle grenades will give our soldiers better range for their grenades than if they were to throw them by hand. This will also increase our armies' firepower in small arms, giving us an edge over our enemies."

 SHX_the_chinese_spirit: "The Chinese Esprit de Corps"
 SHX_the_chinese_spirit_desc: "Though he may be regarded as inferior by the world's imperialist powers, none can contest the Chinese soldier in terms of ferocity and stubbornness. The battles, after all, are won not from the artillery bombardments of afar or the terror from the skies, but rather the deadly nature of close-quarters combat. In these engagements, the soldier has only his trusty and versatile dadao for his survival."

 SHX_under_yan_leadership: "Under Yan's Leadership"
 SHX_under_yan_leadership_desc: "The army is better suited to the leadership of Yan Xishan than assigning tasks and commands to junior officers. The political landscape of China has shown time and time again the large numbers of greedy, ambitious, or utterly incompetent military officers. Given the vast size of Chinese frontlines, it is proposed to establish one centralised command under Yan - miles from the front."

 SHX_trust_the_officers: "Trust the Officers"
 SHX_trust_the_officers_desc: "Emulating the Japanese model, the army must be led by those who know their soldiers best. The officer must be able to know his men personally, he shall know the background, outlook, and personality of every soldier under his command. This way, we will cultivate a spirit of enthusiasm, loyalty, obedience, and sacrifice."

 SHX_encourage_moral_soldiers: "Encourage Civility Amongst Soldiers"
 SHX_encourage_moral_soldiers_desc: "The army is not a noble profession throughout China as oftentimes, soldiers are merely identified as nothing more than bandits sponsored by government authorities. Shanxi's armies must become moral guidance to their people, they must be presented in a way that makes civilians trust and support their soldiers."

 SHX_prepare_for_the_storm: "Prepare for the Storm"
 SHX_prepare_for_the_storm_desc: "Our enemies will strike us from above and they will attempt to breach our mountainous province. We must seek shelter from their bombs and prepare our forces for the storm. We will undertake a large network of caves and tunnels throughout Shanxi and Taiyuan, with military and provincial apparatuses able to carry on the work of the government from deep within the earth."

 SHX_renovate_the_taiyuan_arsenal_desc: "[SHX_taiyuan_arsenal_desc]"
 SHX_taiyuan_arsenal_default_desc: "When Yan Xishan took over the province of Shanxi, his motto of \"armed force is the backing of justice\" demonstrated his belief in the province needing a reliable stream of local modern arms production. Construction on the Arsenal began in 1912 and since then, the arsenal is famed throughout China for producing quality machine guns, field guns, and mortars. We should take steps to expand the arsenal's capabilities in preparation for future conflict."
 SHX_move_arsenal_desc: "The Taiyuan Arsenal has served as Shanxi's premier stream of local modern arms production since 1912. Known for its production of quality machine guns, field guns, and mortars - the arsenal has since been lost as a result of losing Taiyuan province. [SHX.GetLeader] has ordered that construction of a new facility shall begin in Yulin Province as a result to maintain consistent military production in its absence."

 SHX_move_arsenal: "Move Taiyuan Arsenal to Yulin"

 SHX_invite_foreign_advisors: "Invite Foreign Advisors"
 SHX_invite_foreign_advisors_desc: "It's no secret that despite her illustrious military history, the armies of modern China have largely fallen behind Western standards. In order to speed up our military development and training, we should seek the advice and support of military officers from [RUS.GetNameDef], [GER.GetNameDef], or [JAP.GetNameDef]."

 SHX_encourage_local_gun_production: "Encourage Local Gun Production"
 SHX_encourage_local_gun_production_desc: "As our province remains relatively isolated from the rest of China proper due to geography, it is inconvenient for us to purchase and acquire foreign weapons or weapons from the factories of rival warlord states. As such, we shall encourage the production of locally copied designs such as the Type 17 handgun."

 SHX_air_force: "An Air Force for Shanxi"
 SHX_air_force_desc: "While China lacks in quantity of modern planes for the purpose of fighting wars in the air, the province of Shanxi has created the Shanxi Air Academy in the hopes of training enthusiastic recruits for the protection and defence of their home province. We will also secure the purchase of several fighters from [QIE.GetNameDef]."

 SHX_modern_artillery: "Modernise the Type 14"
 SHX_modern_artillery_desc: "The battles fought on the North China Plain have long seen the use of howitzers and cannons to deal devastating firepower. In accordance with this northern model, we will modernise the Type 14 infantry howitzer to improve its range and accuracy as well as improve its mobility over bad terrain."

 SHX_mountains_our_home: "The Mountains our Home"
 SHX_mountains_our_home_desc: "As our province finds itself nestled in between valleys and mountains, we know the land's terrain like the back of our hand. As such, when the enemy tries to push into our naturally built frontiers, they will be met with the stiffest resistance as our soldiers have training fighting in the steep mountains of the Taihang and Luliang."

 SHX_aa_measures: "Create Anti-Aircraft Positions"
 SHX_aa_measures_desc: "In addition to providing a natural fortress for our troops, the rocky terrain of Shanxi can also serve as excellent hiding spots and encampments for anti-aircraft positions. The enemy may expect to easily fly into our province's borders but will be unable to spot our flak from below!"

 SHX_modern_arsenal: "Modern Arsenal of the Northwest"
 SHX_modern_arsenal_desc: "The armies of Shanxi may still lag in terms of quality behind those of Europe, the United States, Russia, and Japan. However, the improvements and refinements made to modernise the Taiyuan arsenal have indeed been successful. There is no doubt due to our ingenuity and progress, that Shanxi's armies shall be one of the most modern forces in all of China!"

 SHX_look_to_guominjun: "Look to the Guominjun Model"
 SHX_look_to_guominjun_desc: "The veterans and remnants of Feng Yuxiang's \"Guominjun\" or National Army fled to Shanxi following Feng's defeat at the hands of Wu Peifu and Zhang Zuolin. The Guominjun is a disciplined army renowned throughout China for its discipline in battle and towards civilians. To modernise the army of the Shanxi Clique, let us look to their model of training and discipline to create a truly professional army."

 SHX_mandatory_training: "Mandate Rigorous Training"
 SHX_mandatory_training_desc: "When Feng Yuxiang was a soldier in Manchuria in 1911, he witnessed how some of the soldiers there were heavily accustomed to the fierce winters of the Chinese Northeast and withstand fatigue. As such, his model advocates for rigorous physical activities such as bodybuilding, weight-lifting, obstacle courses, and gymnastics in order to produce the finest soldiers in all of the Chinese Northwest!"

 SHX_standardise_infantry_education: "Standardise Infantry Education"
 SHX_standardise_infantry_education_desc: "While most of China's soldiers employed in the various warlord armies have tended to be illiterate, the officers of Feng's Guominjun have constructed booklets of proverbs, historical writings, and poems - in Chinese, English, and even Japanese. These booklets are also organised by difficulty levels so that each soldier can work at his level and pace. Examinations are also to be held monthly to maintain the aptitude of Shanxi's generals, officers, and soldiers."

 SHX_towards_the_moral_army: "Towards the Moral Army"
 SHX_towards_the_moral_army_desc: "The army of Shanxi is destined to be more than to be one of many mere mercenary armies in China. Rather, the Guominjun Model proposes that the armed forces of Shanxi be turned into an army for the people; to endear and tend to the impoverished masses of China rather than to harass them. From the isolated Northwest, shall emerge the beginnings of a nationalist revolution to free our oppressed countrymen once and for all!"

 SHX_the_peoples_army: "The People's Army"
 SHX_the_peoples_army_desc: "The Guominjun is also nicknamed \"the People's Army\" due to Feng Yuxiang's orders for his army to respect and aid the people of the land. There is to be no thievery amongst the soldiers of the Guominjun, and any land taken for the sake of the army is to be quickly compensated. From all over China, many will marvel at the discipline and order the Guominjun will bring to their villages and towns - restoring their faith once more in a national army."

 SHX_an_army_that_labours: "An Army that Labours"
 SHX_an_army_that_labours_desc: "To fulfil their training, soldiers of the Guominjun model will be instructed to partake in the construction of public works such as the building of dams, canals, and roads. Not only will this help the lives of their fellow countrymen and raise popular support within the masses, but this will also provide a large labour force for developing Shanxi's economy."

 SHX_disclipine_and_loyalty: "Discipline and Loyalty"
 SHX_disclipine_and_loyalty_desc: "The army is more than just the lone infantryman. Non-commissioned officers, cooks, blacksmiths, buglers, and animal tenders must be all made into effective and competent soldiers. All in the Shanxi Army will be encouraged to practise gun skills and to study military tactics for every man, regardless of his duties, to kill his enemy without hesitation of loyalty or doubt in his aim."

 SHX_infilitration_tactics: "Infiltration Tactics"
 SHX_infilitration_tactics_desc: "Through smoke and fire, we will push through the enemy's lines and break him. Under short and coordinated artillery strikes, our highly trained and professional soldiers will push through the enemy lines with their determination and swords, braving enemy gunfire with their strict discipline and near-fanatical nationalism."

 SHX_whampoa_of_the_north: "Whampoa of the North"
 SHX_whampoa_of_the_north_desc: "Like the famous military academy opened by the late Dr Sun Yat-sen in Guangdong, the generals of Shanxi do hope to turn its military curriculum into that of \"the Whampoa of the North.\" The doctrines taught in the halls of Shanxi's military academies will be similar to that of the Kuomintang, such as infantry tactics from Russia and the Syndicalist nations. It is here in the Chinese Northwest where the revolution may finally succeed."

 SHX_political_commissars: "Implement Political Indoctrination"
 SHX_political_commissars_desc: "We shall adopt the methods of the western nations that prioritise political indoctrination as a means for both educating the troops and ensuring their loyalty to their leaders and their province. However, a disagreement has arisen within the armed forces on whether or not to adopt commissars from Feng Yuxiang's Guominjun or Yan Xishan's own hand-picked officers."

 SHX_improve_our_logistics: "Improve Our Logistics"
 SHX_improve_our_logistics_desc: "With much of our province's roads lacking behind in modern standards and our own supply systems virtually non-existent, we shall purchase some trucks to improve our logistical capabilities and to ensure that our troops are well fed and equipped on the frontlines."

 SHX_our_natural_defenses: "Our Natural Defences"
 SHX_our_natural_defenses_desc: "Shanxi is a mountainous province and has earned a reputation for being a tough nut to crack as her narrow valleys, steep mountains, and rocky valleys have proved difficult for invading armies to break time and time again. We shall strengthen our natural defences by creating foxholes, trenches, bunkers, and other encampments in order to better strengthen our defences."

 SHX_integrate_the_armies: "Integrate the Armies"
 SHX_integrate_the_armies_desc: "The time has come for the armies of Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan to be united into one army for the Shanxi clique, one army for a province that can truly boast having a trained modern army. Integrating the armies will certainly play a role in the balance of power between the two generals..."

 SHX_out_of_beijing: "Out of Beijing's Shadow"
 SHX_out_of_beijing_desc: "The events of the last year have shown that the government in Beijing no longer holds any sway over the numerous warlord cliques vying for power across China. As tensions mount with the ever-present threat of the Fengtian Clique in the Northeast, let us prepare to negotiate our status as a province with the Central Government in the coming days. The choices we make there will decide where we stand in this age of divided states."

 SHX_recognise_gov: "Recognise the National Government"
 SHX_recognise_gov_desc: "The negotiations with [QIE.GetNameDef] have been a complete success and our leaders have agreed to recognise Beijing's claims to sovereignty over the rest of China. In exchange for recognising the Central Government in Beijing as the National Government of China, we hope that the Beijing Government will address our territorial concerns and reward us accordingly for our loyalty."

 SHX_destiny: "Shanxi Marches On!"
 SHX_destiny_desc: "It's clear from the fallout of negotiations with the Central Government that our ambitions will merely be constrained and limited by Beijing. Shanxi's development over the course of Black Monday and our military prowess display the fact that Shanxi's destiny is far greater than merely being subordinate. Opportunities await for those who will dare to take them!"

 SHX_joint_training: "Joint Training in the North China Plain"
 SHX_joint_training_desc: "As part of our fruitful relationship with the Central Government, we will organise a large-scale military exercise programme between the Shanxi Clique and [QIE.GetNameDef]. Not only will this strengthen bonds between the armies of both cliques but this will also prepare us for the coming battles and wars across China."

 SHX_negotiate_trade: "Negotiate Trade Treaties"
 SHX_negotiate_trade_desc: "Our economy has long remained tied to the Central Government in Beijing and its hold over Shanxi's developing economy can be at times both a blessing and a curse. While we are thankful for the economic aid and cooperation fostered by Beijing, our economy's growth is severely limited by the economic investments that businesses in [QIE.GetNameDef] have over us. Let us approach the Beijing Government in hopes of renegotiating the trade treaties due to our continued loyalty and support."

 SHX_northern_war_plan: "Northern War Planning"
 SHX_northern_war_plan_desc: "Soldiers follow orders but it is the generals behind the lines who make decisions that ultimately decide the fate of a battle.

 SHX_shanxi_baoding: "Encourage Baoding Enlistments"
 SHX_shanxi_baoding_desc: "The Baoding Military Academy is the premier military institution in North China and is reputable for its famous alumni, with its cadets eager to learn the ways of modern war in order to help transform China's backward armies. Let us encourage the young men of Shanxi to enlist as new cadets for this school so that they may pass on their knowledge to our armies."

 SHX_vanguard_of_north: "Vanguard of the North"
 SHX_vanguard_of_north_desc: "With our position in North China secured, we are fit to declare ourselves the Central Government's strongest military force in the Chinese Northwest. Yet there may still be regions far from the control of the Central Government that will require our military intervention. As the newly proclaimed Northwest China Political Council, our mission is to ensure that the country in the North and West are reunited once and for all."

 SHX_xibei_loyalty: "Ensure Xibei's Loyalty"
 SHX_xibei_loyalty_desc: "Formally part of the Central Government, the Hui clique of Xibei San Ma, broke off during the chaos of early 1936. Let us seek to demand their submission to the Central Government so that the western frontiers of our country shall be secured."

 SHX_cut_qie_ties: "Sever Ties with Beijing"
 SHX_cut_qie_ties_desc: "Too long have we found ourselves shadowed by the Central Government in Beijing to the East. Yet, there are signs... signs that the times are changing and that our future may be more malleable. The economic collapse of 1936 showed that Beijing's government over us is weaker than what one might be led to believe. Let us seek to slowly break free from our chains and pursue Shanxi's true destiny away from Beijing's shadow."

 SHX_seek_allies: "Seek Republican Allies"
 SHX_seek_allies_desc: "In the wake of the War of the Eight Provinces, the fundamental political situation of China since the Xuantong Restoration has changed dramatically.

 SHX_seek_allies_feng: "Seek Republican Allies"
 SHX_seek_allies_feng_desc: "In the wake of the War of the Eight Provinces, the fundamental political situation of China since the Xuantong Restoration has changed dramatically.

 SHX_war_plan: "Methodical War Planning"
 SHX_war_plan_desc: "We face an enemy with numbers numerically greater than ours, with an industry nearly tenfold of what we are capable of. In the face of such adversity, we shall plan our every step - setting up reconnaissance positions deep behind enemy lines while also tracking enemy movements. A larger enemy does not necessarily entail victory; careful and strategic planning makes the fatal difference between victory and defeat."

 SHX_mobilisation: "Salvation Through Sacrifice"
 SHX_mobilisation_desc: "One cannot expect victory without sacrifices, without losses. As the province prepares to enter its greatest crisis yet - let us cast away divisions and seek nothing more than the complete annihilation of the enemy. Each man and woman throughout the province from Taiyuan to Yan'an will be expected to perform their duty without a single breath of hesitation. To arms once more!"

 SHX_cloak_dagger: "Cloaks and Daggers"
 SHX_cloak_dagger_desc: "While many throughout China may deride our tactics as \"cheap\" and \"unlawful\", our experience in the mountains and rural dry fields of the province has shown us time and time again that it is those who know the terrain who will achieve victory. While the enemy may expect to meet us on the open battlefield, we shall strike them from behind, pierce them in the rear, and bring them the terror of a modern guerrilla war."

 SHX_defend_resist: "Defend and Resist!"
 SHX_defend_resist_desc: "The enemy is at the gates and the situation indeed grows dire day by day. In this time of crisis, all must be called up from their homes, their fields, and their schools to participate in the war of national liberation. For each inch of land, we will make them pay two-fold in blood. For each town or village lost, we will make them suffer and regret ever stepping foot in our province!"

 SHX_beyond_borders: "Beyond the Provincial Borders"
 SHX_beyond_borders_desc: "In one fell swoop, the Central Government of [QIE.GetNameDef] has utterly collapsed. In the wake of such a change in the political landscape, it is clear that our ambitions have clearly greater goals and that we are indeed fit to carry out the long-awaited unification of our country. From the mountains of Shanxi, the flames of revolution continue to burn bright and we shall liberate our nation once and for all!"

 SHX_suiyuan_question: "The Suiyuan Question"
 SHX_suiyuan_question_desc: "Suiyuan, to the east has been long sought by those who rule Shanxi as a potential means of enhancing Shanxi Province's productivity. The region is rich and full of iron and has plenty of uncultivated lands, lands that could be used to meet the needs of Shanxi's increasingly demanding province. Let us approach the Ma Clique and the Central Government in the hopes of achieving a mediated settlement."

 SHX_national_army_desc: "At the end of the day the army that won us our great victories thus far is not up to the standards a great power would require. If we are to complete our revolution, unite our people, and drive out the imperialists, then we must utilise our newly found resources to modernise and expand our capabilities. But we will never forget the brave spirit our men have carried from Shanxi to [SHX.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]!"

 SHX_renovate_military_academies: "Renovate Military Academies"
 SHX_renovate_military_academies_desc: "Whampoa, Baoding...these names are familiar to every citizen of the Chinese country as prestigious military academies that have fostered a generation of patriotic heroes that have defended and saved the country from total ruin. With the recent unification of China under Shanxi-led forces, it is only fitting that we see to it that these academies are renovated and modernised, in order to address the lessons learned in recent wars."

 SHX_the_modern_chinese_soldier: "The Modern Chinese Soldier"
 SHX_the_modern_chinese_soldier_desc: "The warlords' armies were infamous worldwide for their apparent incompetence and lack of modern equipment. As part of our provinical duty during the ZhiFeng War to create a modern army, we take pride in our efforts to modernise the image of the Chinese soldier. Equipped with the latest rifles and imbued with the spirit of revolution, the rifleman of the new China stands above all else!"

 SHX_rapid_militarisation: "Rapid Militarisation"
 SHX_rapid_militarisation_desc: "With the economy finally recovering and a large central authority upon China once more since the collapse of the Qing Dynasty in 1911, the new Republican Chinese government has begun a rapid process of miltiarisation in both naval and arms production, in the hopes of catching up the capacity and quality of the Chinese Armed Forces to the rest of the world."

 SHX_modern_officer_corps: "Modern Officer Corps"
 SHX_modern_officer_corps_desc: "The future of any army belongs to the officer corps, the men who are able to rally sense, duty, and patriotism into the ranks of the common soldier. It is impertinent that if the army of the newly reunified Republic of China seeks to catch up with the rest of the western world, then a considerable amount of effort must be placed to reorganise the country's officer corps into a modern elite force."

 SHX_broadfront_operations_capacity: "Broadfront Operations Capacity"
 SHX_broadfront_operations_capacity_desc: "With the Chinese National Army reformed and larger than ever before, we are now able to adopt greater operational capacity on broader fronts. With improved reconnaissance units as well as a greater understanding of logistics and air power, our forces will be able to undertake greater and larger campaigns than it was previously capable of during the provinical era."

 SHX_build_a_navy: "Revive the Beiyang Fleet"
 SHX_build_a_navy_desc: "For centuries China was a maritime power, but the humiliating defeats inflicted upon us by the Japanese and Westerners have shattered our national pride. The prolonged land-based fighting in the Warlord Era has stripped critical resources for maintaining a fleet worthy of a great nation, something that must be quickly restored if we are to defend our extensive coastline."

 SHX_fortify_coastal_bulwark: "Fortify the Coastal Bulwark"
 SHX_fortify_coastal_bulwark_desc: "China's vast land expanse means that the enemy will most likely attempt a naval invasion of our country rather than a direct land invasion. Given the economic and political importance of the coastal regions, we would do well to prepare in advance of the enemy's invasion by fortifying and preparing the coastline with bunkers, pillboxes, and other defences."

 SHX_dockyards: "Rapid Dockyard Expansion Programme"
 SHX_dockyards_desc: "Due to its geographical location, few in Shanxi would have ever imagined the need for a navy. With the restoration of the Republic of China under the leadership of the Shanxi Clique, we now hold the capabilities to create and establish a national navy. As part of our greater national efforts to improve and modernise our navy, let us embark on a rapid expansion programme to create new dockyards!"

 SHX_new_navy_new_traditions: "New Navy, New Traditions"
 SHX_new_navy_new_traditions_desc: "Tradition is important in life, but there are few places where it is of such significance as aboard the fleet. Even as China's naval capacity shrank, the fleet remains divided into various competing regional cliques. With a steady hand, we shall fuse them into one Chinese fleet, infused with the enlightenment of the Three Principles and combining the lessons learned across the nation. This is how we shall win."

 SHX_advanced_coastal_defensive_plans: "Advanced Coastal Defensive Plans"
 SHX_advanced_coastal_defensive_plans_desc: "China's long coastline is a major vulnerability in the event of foreign invasion, as prior wars have demonstrated. Although the land-based defences are in the army's domain, the fleet also has a responsibility to keep invaders off our shores and harry those foolish enough to try. With adequate early-warning systems and crafty tactics, we can strike our foes at their weakest by the coast."

 SHX_integrate_naval_air_coordination_desc: "Naval Aviation is a field that has made great strides over the last few decades. While it might be premature to believe us capable of such operations given our limited air and sea capabilities, we have an advantage over our more established peers in our lack of entrenched doctrines. Therefore, we must be willing to have flexibility, bringing both our naval and air assets together in a deadly combination."

 SHX_undersea_warfare: "Undersea Warfare"
 SHX_undersea_warfare_desc: "Beneath the surface in the darkest depths, intrepid men in deadly vessels lurk. Submarine warfare was in its infancy in the previous war, but has since become an equaliser between the haughty fleets of the status quo and the states that they oppress. We shall make full use of these technologies to raid enemy supply convoys supplying their invasion forces, and also pick off any vulnerable capital ships."

 SHX_fleet_of_the_republic: "Fleet of the Republic"
 SHX_fleet_of_the_republic_desc: "The new republic needs a new fleet capable of defending its shores. With investments already underway and lost years slowly recovered, the once withered and divided Chinese fleet has been reborn. Already a new fleet is taking shape, capable of taking on foes it once had no choice but to cower from. We are a long way from becoming a great maritime power again, but our star continues to rise!"

 SHX_protect_the_three_seas: "Protect the Three Seas"
 SHX_protect_the_three_seas_desc: "China's destiny belongs not merely on the land but also across the three seas that surround it. Moreover, there are so many other peoples across Asia that yearn for liberation from colonial powers, and it is only by developing a fleet capable of challenging these oppressors that China can resume its leadership role for the continent. Our armies march, and our fleet will support them all the way to defend our great country from harm."

 SHX_chinese_grand_fleet: "Chinese Grand Fleet"
 SHX_chinese_grand_fleet_desc: "It is not enough for us to be satisfied with petty gunboats and outdated cruisers. A real fleet requires capital ships, those capable of shredding apart enemy escorts and bombarding enemy fortifications. If we are serious about our naval ambitions, we must be willing to invest in the pricey grand vessels worth of great powers. We are living in the dawn of a new age in the Pacific, and may we be at the centre."

 SHX_final_battle: "The Final Battle"
 SHX_final_battle_desc: "Despite our victory over the Japanese imperialists in the Second-Sino Japanese War, with their advantage at sea - the arrogant Japanese refused to return our island of Taiwan to the Chinese Republic after the ceasefire. Thanks to the success of our naval modernisation programme, we now have the capabilities to challenge the Japanese and fight them once more to reclaim the island of Taiwan for China!"

 SHX_national_air_force: "Establish the Baoding Aviation Institute"
 SHX_national_air_force_desc: "Although during our tenure in Shanxi we've entertained various airborne projects, neither strongmen truly had the resources to develop a worthy air fleet. It is imperative if we are to keep up with developments in military theory that we begin building a national air force capable of challenging the skies. Moreover, it would be a great force multiplier against any remaining warlord forces."

 SHX_expand_airbases: "Expand Air Infrastructure"
 SHX_expand_airbases_desc: "Much of the rural land of China may serve as plentiful land for our growing air industry, which can be used to accommodate not just military aircraft but also civilian transportation and travel aswell. In our steps towards modernising the Chinese nation as well as the Chinese Armed Forces, we should seek to expand our miltiary air bases and industries in order to strengthen the nation."
 SHX_imitiate_foreign_air_designs: "Imitate Foreign Air Designs"
 SHX_imitiate_foreign_air_designs_desc: "Despite our best efforts at domestic air production, it is clear that if China is to catch up with the rest of the world - we ought to emulate successful fighter designs from around the world. We shall send advisors and engineers to foreign countries that we have worked with so that they can bring back essential expertise and designs to help produce new and modern planes."

 SHX_invite_foreign_aviation_instructors: "Invite Foreign Aviation Instructors"
 SHX_invite_foreign_aviation_instructors_desc: "While Shanxi was one of the few provinces in China to boast a modest air force, now that we encompass the entirety of the Chinese country - it is clear that our pilots are ill-trained, our doctirne outdated, and our planes far from comptent. We should invite foreign aviation instructors, expatriates, and war veterans to come and serve in the Chinese Air Force as advisors to help strengthen our forces."

 SHX_encourage_attack_aviation: "Encourage Attack Aviation"
 SHX_encourage_attack_aviation_desc: "As shown in modern conflicts around the world, and especially by the world's major powers, the future of aviation lies in combined efforts with ground troops to launch decisive breakthroughs with an unprecedented level of firepower. Our flying students in Europe have witnessed attack bombers being used in European conflicts and are eager to share their knowledge with us."

 SHX_long_range_supremacy: "Long-Range Supremacy"
 SHX_long_range_supremacy_desc: "Given China's vast terrain, it is logical that our focous on air doctrine should be focused on our bombers' and fighters' long-range capabilities, as this will allow them to cover more range and territory while providing sufficient airpower necessary to win modern wars. We should invest heavily into seeking to improve our planes range and fuel capacities for this matter."

 SHX_dive_bombing_focus: "Air-Land Integration"
 SHX_dive_bombing_focus_desc: "Experiences in both Europe and Asia have shown that true wars are won when ground and air forces work in tandem, with a focus on close ranged air support bombers that are able to provide more precise and lightning like strikes on enemy logistics and supplies instead of slower long range bombers. We should seek to adopt this model for our growing air force needs in order to modernise our forces successfully."

 SHX_roc_air_force: "The Republic of China Air Force"
 SHX_roc_air_force_desc: "Initial provinical and early attempts by the former national governments have all but failed in creating a truly modern and extensive air force, worthy of defending our vast skies and domain. Our efforts to modernise and train a new formidable national air force are finally bearing fruit and now, we can finally proclaim to the world the official creation of a new and strengthened Republic of China Air Force for generations to come."

 SHX_enshrine_the_fighter_cult: "Enshrine the Fighter Cult"
 SHX_enshrine_the_fighter_cult_desc: "During the War of Resistance against the Empire of Japan, Chinese pilots from across the country challenged notions of technological and skill inferiority in the face of adversity, against a much more superior enemy. This has given rise within our country of a cult of the air, enshrining fighter aces as eternal heroes for the rest of the country to look up towards as exemplary patriots of their new China."

 SHX_airborne_special_forces: "Airborne Special Forces"
 SHX_airborne_special_forces_desc: "In the world of modern war, it is the daring that shall be victorious. An experimental division has been created of the most excellent and fit of our soldiers to serve in an elite unit. This brave unit is inspired by contemporary usage of paratroopers, allowing units to deploy into combat zones without land passage. While such tactics are radical and new with casualties to be expected, fortune favours the bold!"

 SHX_utilise_arsenals: "Utilise Warlord Arsenals"
 SHX_utilise_arsenals_desc: "As our forces sweep across China with the fervour of unification, we have seized multiple abandoned arms factories and arsenals left behind by their provincial warlords. Like Yan, many have built up arms-production facilities of their own over the years. Let us utilise these arsenals and upgrade them so that they may serve the needs of the nation rather than another power-hungry regional tyrant."

 SHX_chinese_marines: "Marines of the Republic"
 SHX_chinese_marines_desc: "While lacking a maritime tradition, the first Marines of the Republic of China trace their lineage to the Wuchang Uprising of 1911. While originally a "Navy Guard", a standard Marine Corps was established in 1914 although efforts to modernise and create a standard marine division have since then fallen short. Let us continue their legacy by creating our very own republican marines that will protect our shores!"

 SHX_new_methods: "Embrace New Methods"
 SHX_new_methods_desc: "The tragic irony of the warlord era is that with all the spending placed on maintaining regionalist forces, the Chinese nation has been unable to afford modern military formations on a meaningful scale. Since the last nationwide reforms to the military in the Self-Strengthening Movement, warfare has greatly transformed. Nimble tanks and trucks have replaced the old cavalry, but they will not outpace us."

 SHX_future_of_war: "The Future of Chinese War"
 SHX_future_of_war_desc: "\"Quickness is the essence of war\", and as the world changes so too does the nature of conflict. Planes, tanks, and battleships may make the headlines in their glamour, but as we chase the future of warfare we must not forget some of the other critical developments as well. Planning, coordination, and doctrine are all essentials to today's wars, and as a new day emerges in Baoding, we must not forget them."

 SHX_new_army_new_china: "A New Army for a New China"
 SHX_new_army_new_china_desc: "Like the Beiyang Army before or Sun Yat-sen's attempts to create a National Revolutionary Army, the armies of Shanxi pride themselves as being fully modernised and up to date with modern tactics and strategy in the era of modern war. Having successfully fought in brutal wars to unify the country and to resist Japanese aggression, we shall continue to strive to ensure our forces remain the vanguard for our glorious civilisation."

 SHX_towards_the_dream_of_unification_desc: "Although [SHX.GetLeader] has secured his place as a leader among the Chinese people, there remain other strongmen and warlords vying for control of the land. Eliminating our rivals and asserting our authority over the warlords is integral towards our long-held aim of national unification, as is the elimination of secessionists. With our banners raised, we shall sweep away anyone who dares to stand in our way."

 SHX_rural_reconstruction: "Rural Reconstruction"
 SHX_rural_reconstruction_desc: "The Rural Reconstruction Movement, founded by intellectuals Yan Yangchu (James Yen) and Liang Shuming was conceived with the desire to revive the Chinese village. Although we were divided by their support for Wu Peifu across the early 1930s, James Yen was a tremendous help in devising our educational reforms. Their ideas for the modern Chinese countryside are expected to likewise be a major success."

 SHX_stabilise_national_economy: "Stabilise the National Economy"
 SHX_stabilise_national_economy_desc: "The enemies of the battlefield are but one foe we must vanquish. The threats of hyperinflation and bankruptcy stalk us as we not only inherit Beijing's authority but also its copious debts. Through a careful mixture of taxes, seizing enemy assets, cutting wasteful spending, and securing foreign loans, we can stave off economic catastrophe and win over the support of the business community."

 SHX_mass_education_reforms: "Advance Countrywide Literacy Efforts"
 SHX_mass_education_reforms_desc: "One of the great ambitions of various Chinese intellectuals over the last few decades has been the promotion of universal education, which many hope will uplift the Chinese people and restore the nation to its previous cultural and economic dominance. We ourselves have worked tirelessly in this regard back in Shanxi, and it is time that we engage with northern scholars to promote this noble national endeavour."

 SHX_our_claims_to_national_leadership: "Our Claims to National Leadership"
 SHX_our_claims_to_national_leadership_desc: "Having bested our northern rivals, we have become another claimant to the legacy of the Xinhai legacy, given an opportunity to right the wrongs of the past and bring the hopeful change of the Beiyang Republic that never was. Still, there are plenty of other pretenders out there and as we navigate the challenges of being a national government, we must be wary not to let our guard down."

 SHX_reject_humiliation: "Reject a Century of Humiliation"
 SHX_reject_humiliation_desc: "Millennia of Chinese peace and splendour came to a crushing end with British aggression in 1839. Since then, Chinese authority has unravelled, with many Chinese cities on the coast being handed over to foreign powers. Now that our nation is once more on the rise, their sun sets in the east. We shall drive out the wretched imperialists from Chinese land, liberating our people from their exploitation!"

 SHX_zhonghua_revived: "Zhonghua Revived"
 SHX_zhonghua_revived_desc: "The Chinese nation has at last been restored under one republic, our Republic of China. With the imperialists vanquished, their concessionist cronies evicted, and secessionists, regionalists and warlords all brought to heel, we can finally end the destruction and focus on rebuilding. At last, the idealistic dreams of Xinhai can be reborn, able to take flight over the darkness that had engulfed our nation."

 SHX_tender_to_the_people: "The Three Prosperities"
 SHX_tender_to_the_people_desc: "The Sanxing refer to the mythical deities in Chinese folk religion associated with a good life. These are Fortune (Fu), Prosperity (Lu), and Longevity (Shou). As we have taken the mantle of national leadership, in exchange for the people's loyalty we must in turn provide and tend for the laobaixing. This means ensuring not only strong government and armies, but also a robust welfare state."

 SHX_fund_national_academies: "Fund the National Academies"
 SHX_fund_national_academies_desc: "Years of warfare and brutality have left little money or attention to academia, with many of our brightest minds going abroad - never to return. The ones that have stayed often find themselves pressured to make themselves useful for the various warlords, either as a means of propaganda or military innovation. As we return to a state of peace, as a nation we can once again focus on civilian studies and research."

 SHX_legacy_of_gmj: "Legacy of the Guominjun"
 SHX_legacy_of_gmj_desc: "The Guominjun was an army built by Feng Yuxiang to liberate the laobaixing and restore morality to a land ravaged by foreign pillagers and domestic tyrants. As we disarm and move towards civilian rule, we must not forget the sacrifices our brave soldiers have made. Pensions and honours aside, it is vital that their spirit, discipline, and revolutionary zeal are never lost in our new China. May even our fallen heroes know their children grow up in a changed and better land."

 SHX_ten_aims: "The Ten Immediate Aims"
 SHX_ten_aims_desc: "Years ago, when Feng Yuxiang first took command of Kaifeng, he released a list of Ten Immediate Aims to clean up the corruption he found and alleviate the suffering he saw. Decades later, as he settles into a new capital as the new master of China, the decisions he takes next will have effects that reverberate across the nation. With gusto, the new rulers hurry to set a positive example for the provinces."

 SHX_comrades: "Our Republican Comrades"
 SHX_comrades_desc: "Although we have done the lion's share of the work in building the new republic, we must not forget the millions of fellow travellers who have likewise sought a free and democratic state. Although in the strife of the past few years we may have clashed with some of them, the reality is many have benevolent ideas worth considering as we craft our own national policy. Hearing them out may have its benefits."

 SHX_new_life: "New Life, Old Principles"
 SHX_new_life_desc: "Feng Yuxiang has promoted what he called the New Life Movement, an effort at renewing the Chinese character and instilling proper morality among the people. As we pursue a reborn Chinese nation and people, we must be quick to embrace the positives of change but also retain the positive traditions that make up the Chinese identity. It is in this way that we truly break the shackles of warlordism."
 #Note, this New Life Movement preceded Chiang's otl one.

 SHX_realise_revolution: "Realising our Revolutionary Goals"
 SHX_realise_revolution_desc: "It is not enough to simply throw out the old corrupt dictators in Beijing and elsewhere, or oust other warlord contenders that sought national power. If we are to truly win over the decades of discord warlordism has brought, then we must bring about change to the very bottom of the social ladder. We must commit ourselves to the total liberation of the laobaixing, under the careful guidance of Feng Yuxiang."

 SHX_from_china_to_world: "From China to the World"
 SHX_from_china_to_world_desc: "China is a great nation, with a great destiny. It has long served as a protector of peoples in the east, a role that it will once more assume under Feng Yuxiang's reborn republic. Under our watchful patronage, we will cast off the yoke of Western imperialists and restore the peace that once existed in Asia. Our armies march not just for the sake of our people, but all those around us."

 SHX_national_heart_washing: "The Philosophy of China"
 SHX_national_heart_washing_desc: "Yan Xishan has proposed, in his wisdom earned through decades of practical experience, a refined version of his ideology he calls the \"Philosophy of China\". This collection of principles, thoughts, and practices honed in by our beloved junzi, an epitome of Confucian wisdom, shall ensure that China never again falls back into the squalor that has defined its existence for the past century."

 SHX_tradition: "Tradition and Progress"
 SHX_tradition_desc: "Yan Xishan's greatest strength as a leader is his ability to take new concepts and technology and synthesise it with the best of Chinese traditions and values. This has allowed him to make great strides in modernising Shanxi, allowing him to serve as the progressive but wise leader needed to lift China back to the role it was meant to play in the world. Under President Yan, our future is bright!"

 SHX_national_government: "Nonpartisan Government"
 SHX_national_government_desc: "Yan Xishan is a member of no party, believing himself above the petty squabbles of bickering lobbyists. Instead, he is a statesman, a President capable of bridging divisions and ending the needly partisanship that has long consumed democracies. If our republic is to work, we must find common ground, and our wise leader will ensure that the best ideas the nation's intellectuals can conceive will enter into policy."

 SHX_model_to_system: "From a Model to a System"
 SHX_model_to_system_desc: "In the humble province of Shanxi, Yan Xishan's brilliant leadership transformed it into a prosperous and stable oasis amidst the dark days. It is there that Yan became an envy of other provinces, a leader the nation begged to take charge. Yan will never forget, however, his roots in the \"Model Province\", and the successes there ought to be studied by future bureaucrats in the decades to come."

 SHX_father_of_nation: "Father of the Nation"
 SHX_father_of_nation_desc: "Many men tried to secure the loyalty of China through the bayonet, crushing the people under their boot. Not Yan Xishan. Like a father, he protects his people, his men, and his nation. He teaches them what they need to know, he guides them through hard times, he provides for them, and he sets an example for them to follow. China is being reborn in its founding father's image, and he proudly watches as it takes its first steps into its future."

 SHX_statesman: "The International Statesman, Yan Xishan!"
 SHX_statesman_desc: "Even as a governor of an isolated province within China, Yan Xishan has always been conscious of the need for good international press. Now, as the face of a new Chinese Republic, he has been working tirelessly to convince the world of our benevolence while asserting our authority over East Asia. China will once more be a great power, a leader of the various Asian peoples and protecting them from foreign interference."

 SHX_a_new_beiyang_focus_desc: "China has been united under a new republic, the way the old one should have been. Now that things have settled down, we shall weigh the merits of proposals others have put forward, building on the foundation our Beiyang predecessors left for us. Although not necessarily opposed to one another, the groups we favour and the policies we adopt will set the tone for the formative years of our government."

 SHX_listen_to_independent_voices_focus: "Listen to Independent Voices"
 SHX_listen_to_independent_voices_focus_desc: "Hu Shih and his coterie of non-partisan legislators have declared themselves \"independent critics\" of the government, claiming to offer an educated, outsider's view of our new government to the Chinese people. In a country where political dissent is often violently silenced, engaging with these intellectuals offers us a chance to demonstrate our willingness towards political reform within the Beiyang system."

 SHX_herding_the_republicans_focus: "Herding the Republicans"
 SHX_herding_the_republicans_focus_desc: "The chief problem with Chinese Republicans is their lack of unity and focus, never quite organised as an opposition and never cohesive enough to make change even when given power. The national assembly may be filled with great thinkers, but actually putting their minds to use for the good of the nation will require good leadership on our part, coaxing them out of their ivory towers and into the real world."

 SHX_entreat_the_endeavor_society_focus: "Entreat the Endeavour Society"
 SHX_entreat_the_endeavor_society_focus_desc: "The Endeavour Newspaper is the centre of a web of progressive intellectuals that draws from around the political spectrum. Hu Shih, Cai Yuanpei, Li Dazhao, Liang Shuming, Wang Chonghui and others have contributed, with an eclectic mix of opinions only united in their common call for greater transparency, more long term planning, and better governance. We must adopt the best of this think tank's suggestions."

 SHX_strengthen_the_legislature_focus: "Strengthen the Legislature"
 SHX_strengthen_the_legislature_focus_desc: "The National Assembly has long been ignored by Beijing's revolving door of warlords and strongmen, treated as another organ to be bribed, intimidated, and stacked with loyalists. While critics may say we have a long way to go before that changes, we can take the first steps in the right direction by taking into consideration the input of our legislators, and respecting the outcomes of their deliberations."

 SHX_stewarding_the_national_recovery_focus: "Stewarding the National Recovery"
 SHX_stewarding_the_national_recovery_focus_desc: "The veteran politicians of the Recovery Party know that to get things done in China, reformers have to balance the call for change with the need to respect the powers that be. They are banking on the President to see reason, not threat, in their batch of \"sensible\" reforms to stabilise the republic."

 SHX_currying_international_exports_focus: "Currying International Exports"
 SHX_currying_international_exports_focus_desc: "The topic of how to handle international trade has always been a dicey one after the Century of Humiliation. Foreign money is needed to jumpstart modernisation, but foreign control is intolerable after generations of unequal negotiations. We will begin a guided process of building our economy around industrial exports, with the government serving as a broker to prevent exploitation by unscrupulous outsiders."

 SHX_domestic_infrastructure_projects_focus: "Domestic Infrastructure Projects"
 SHX_domestic_infrastructure_projects_focus_desc: "A crucial facet in our drive towards a national recovery is the rebuilding of physical and human infrastructure in war-torn China as well as the construction of new rail-lines and roads to connect the Chinese interior to the cities. With handy expertise managing these projects in relatively industrialised Manchuria, and connections with like-minded partners, we can set the stage for economic revival."

 SHX_investing_in_education_focus: "Investing in Education"
 SHX_investing_in_education_focus_desc: "The foundation that our ambitious plans rest on is mass education, which often intersects with economic, political, and even military matters. Combating illiteracy and expanding access to higher education are vital to our agenda, and popular among the old CERA base, many of whom are foreign educated intellectuals that stand to benefit. Committing to this plan will secure their return to the DCP."

 SHX_the_rural_revival_focus_desc: "Yan Yangchu is a prominent reformist intellectual, who eschews national politics in favour of focusing on the cause he champions: the revival of the rural village in China. Formerly close to Liang Qichao, he maintained some association with Liang's party, which has evolved into its latest incarnation in the DCP. With greater financial and political investments, we build a new China from the ground up!"

 SHX_anti_corruption_efforts_focus: "Anti-Corruption Efforts"
 SHX_anti_corruption_efforts_focus_desc: "Calls to fight corruption and excessive nepotism echo across the political spectrum, who often struggle to break into entrenched patronage networks in warlord China. Although it will be a long time before the civil service runs without bribes or favours to grease its wheels, we can at least free it of sordid stories of graft and unchecked theft with better financial monitoring and accountability."

 SHX_solicit_southern_compromises_focus_desc: "The three or four decades of division in the warlord era may seem insignificant compared to China's milenia long history, but its impact cannot be understated. Our Southern brethren have developed their own political traditions over the years, with many divergent ideas for reform. Reconciling those ideas with our own is the only way we can reach a democratic republic as one nation."

 SHX_reconciling_north_south_focus: "Reconciling North-South"
 SHX_reconciling_north_south_focus_desc: "One of the worst consequences of 1911 was the division of China into northern and southern governments. Since then, northern factions frequently found themselves on the opposite side of their southern counterparts, and even as sub-factions proliferated the fundamental animosity remained. Victory on the battlefield brought unification, but true unity will require incorporating ideas from both sides."

 SHX_commit_to_constitutionalism: "Commit to Constitutionalism"
 SHX_commit_to_constitutionalism_desc: "A common call from reformers across the land is for China's leadership to adhere to the constitution, especially as warlord generals ignore even the documents they drafted themselves. While revisions to the current, provisional constitution will likely be needed, including input from different parties and respected elder statesmen will give the drafting process some legitimacy as we aim for a better future."

 SHX_embrace_federalist_principles_focus_desc: "While virtually every faction in China has adopted the principle of reforming China from the village upwards, the role of the provinces has been much more controversial because of its association with warlordism and challenges to the central government. Still, now that we have developed a strong central government, we can surely delegate some autonomy to the provinces rather than monopolise power."

We must safeguard our republic, and keep this treasonous rhetoric out of deliberations."

 SHX_eliminate_regionalism_focus: "Eliminate Regionalism"
 SHX_eliminate_regionalism_focus_desc: "Regionalism has a long history in China, though the roots of our current predicament arguably can be most immediately traced to the devolution of authority by the Qing government as Manchu power declined. The ensuing civil wars and warlord armies after 1911 worsened this problem, and it will only be solved with the restoration of a strong central government and the reining in of disloyal governors."

The ensuing chaos did little to solve the fundamental problems plaguing the nation, and so the Beiyang Republic had little to do but fall.

Both a conquering general and a powerful thinker, it is only right that he be lauded as an example for all Chinese patriots to obey and imitate for generations to come!"

 SHX_a_bureau_of_progress_focus_desc: "In order to streamline administration we shall empower a Bureau of Progress under the Executive that will coordinate our rapid overhauls of the army and industry.

 SHX_undertake_mass_militarisation_focus_desc: "The world we live in is one of survival of the fittest. For too long, our proud and peaceful nation has been bullied by foreign powers, who plunder our land with thinly veiled avarice. The only way for China to survive is to become and stay powerful, and the only way to do so if for the entire nation to be ready to do what it takes to overcome anything that stands in the way of national glory!"

 SHX_centralise_the_national_government_focus_desc: "One of the worst crimes of the decaying Manchu government was to begin devolving authority to provincial assemblies in a futile effort to prop up their empire. This set the stage for unscrupulous warlords and secessionists to exploit provincial governments to line their pockets and defy the government at the people's expense, something that must never be allowed to happen ever again!!"

 SHX_dawn_of_the_party_state_focus_desc: "Our allies have both tapped into a rather distinctly modern phenomenon: the absolute role of the party in political affairs. Of course, this is only the natural evolution of every proper government's role in harnessing the will of the people to defend their nation's interests. Since this is clearly the future, we will not fall behind the tide of history - once again, China will be at the forefront of human advancement!"

 SHX_crash_industrialisation_focus_desc: "Foreign powers have not simply slaughtered our people and stolen our resources, but in the process they have stripped our nation of the industrial advancements that allowed them to leap ahead into the modern age. They have tried to shackle our own economy to theirs, turning our nation into that of a permanent vassal state. We have no choice then, we must utilise every resource at our disposal to catch up!"
