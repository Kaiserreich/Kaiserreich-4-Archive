 PHI_totalist_party: "POF"
 PHI_totalist_party_long: "$PHI_syndicalist_party_long$"

 PHI_syndicalist_party: "POF"
 PHI_syndicalist_party_long: "Partido Obrero de Filipinas\n§LThe Partido Obrero is the leading body of the Philippine far-left. Originally founded in 1924 as a vehicle for labour candidates in municipal elections, it was quickly captured by far-left activists, who used it as a pressure group to push the Philippine Labor Congress towards a more radical stance. The POF is ideologically syndicalist and an affiliate of the Third International; its main base of support lies among the Manila working class. However, it has formed close links to major Luzon peasant groups, a necessity in a country where most of the population is still rural.§!\n"

 PHI_radical_socialist_party: "POF"
 PHI_radical_socialist_party_long: "$PHI_syndicalist_party_long$"

 PHI_social_democrat_party: "PR"
 PHI_social_democrat_party_long: "Partido Republicano\n§LThe Partido Republicano was founded by writer, journalist, and labour activists Isabelo de los Reyes in 1905. Reflecting de los Reyes's progressive and idiosyncratic beliefs, it was mainly a vehicle for his own electoral efforts. Eventually, de los Reyes passed leadership of the Republicanos to his close friend Gregorio Aglipay, first bishop of Philippine Independent Church. It was rendered effectively defunct after the 1935 Presidential Election.§!\n"

 PHI_social_liberal_party: "PD"
 PHI_social_liberal_party_long: "Partido Democrata\n§LThe Democrata was formed in 1917 following the merger of the Partido Nacional Progresista and the Partido Nacional Democrata, at the time the two main opponents to the Nacionalista Party. In fact, the Democratas have been almost entirely defined by their opposition to the Nacionalistas. When the Nacionalistas split among themselves, the Democratas were able to exploit the division; but when the Nacionalistas came back together, the Democratas would be out in the cold again. After years of struggling to provide an alternative vision for Philippine politics, the party has been moving in a more progressive direction under the brilliant Claro M. Recto, who paints the Democratas as defenders of clean government and civil liberties.§!\n"

 PHI_market_liberal_party: "PN"
 PHI_market_liberal_party_long: "Partido Nacionalista\n§LThe Nacionalista Party was founded in 1907 by the young politicians who advocated \"immediate and unconditional independence\" from the United States. Under that simple platform, they won a crushing victory in the first legislative elections and have ever since. With their control of politics at the national, provincial, and local levels, the Nacionalistas have built an impressive machine built on family dynasties, clientelism, and corruption. Party leader Manuel Quezon has built his career on his mastery of playing this dirty political game, but that is not to say that his actions are wholly cynical. Quezon and the Nacionalistas genuinely pursue national development while trying to maintain stability and the traditional Philippine hierarchy.§!\n"

 PHI_social_conservative_party: "PN"
 PHI_social_conservative_party_long: "$PHI_market_liberal_party_long$"

 PHI_authoritarian_democrat_party_roxas: "PN"
 PHI_authoritarian_democrat_party_roxas_long: "Partido Nacionalista\n§LThe Nacionalista Party was founded in 1907 by the young politicians who advocated \"immediate and unconditional independence\" from the United States. Under that simple platform, they won a crushing victory in the first legislative elections and have ever since. With their control of politics at the national, provincial, and local levels, the Nacionalistas have built an impressive machine built on family dynasties, clientelism, and corruption. When President Quezon attempted to depart from this tradition with his personalist populism, the Nacionalistas corrected themselves by dumping him and rallying around Manuel Roxas. Together they will ensure that the traditional powers-that-be in the Philippines are not threatened.§!\n"

 PHI_authoritarian_democrat_party: "PPS"
 PHI_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Partido Pambansang Sosyalista\n§LThe Partido Pambansang Sosyalista is a recent development. It is nothing more than the vehicle for the potential presidential candidate Emilio Aguinaldo, who declares it to be not a party but \"a movement\". What support it has comes mainly from the aged veterans of the War for Independence and the Philippine-American War, who see Aguinaldo as their leader. The PPS' reputation is therefore synonymous with that of Aguinaldo, who nonetheless is a popular figure among the common people.§!\n"

 PHI_paternal_autocrat_party: "PC"
 PHI_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "Philippine Constabulary\n§LThe Philippine Constabulary was a creation of the Americans, who needed a native auxiliary to maintain law and order in the islands during its war of conquest. The Constabulary's main tasks were defeating the last rebels and putting down the Moro Rebellion; since then, it has transformed into something like a national gendarmerie, serving as law enforcement and as a component of national defence alongside the young Army. The Constabulary is notorious among the common people for its harshness in putting down potential threats to the state, whether that be protesting peasants or religious movements.§!\n"

 PHI_national_populist_party: "PS"
 PHI_national_populist_party_long: "Partido Sakdalista\n§LThe Sakdalista Party was founded in 1933 by the disgruntled former Nacionalista Benigno Ramos. Ramos had worked as a Senate clerk and was close to Quezon, but broke with the party after joining a wildcat strike. He then set up the newspaper \"Sakdal\" (Tagalog for \"to accuse\"), which became an anti-Nacionalista screed, mercilessly attacking the government for faults both real and perceived. The Sakdalista movement has spread throughout Luzon, gaining support for its populism, extreme nationalism, and anti-Americanism.§!\n"

He joined one of the country's first labour unions, the Unión de Impresores de Filipinas, eventually becoming its secretary-general. Though initially a Nacionalista, Evangelista was increasingly influenced by Marxist ideas and joined the Partido Obrero, where he led the charge to transform it into a truly revolutionary socialist party. Since then, the Partido Obrero has pushed the Congreso Obrero de Filipinas towards syndicalism. Evangelista has earned the plaudits of the Third International, which recognises him as the paramount leader of Philippine syndicalism.§!"

With peasant organisations springing up in central Luzon, the Nacionalista Party sponsored the creation of the Kalipunang Pambansa ng Magbubukid sa Pilipinas (National Confederation of Peasants of the Philippines). Feleo became vice president of the KPMP and moved the group in a more militant direction, confronting the political establishment. His success and notoriety, including several stints in jail earned him a place among the leadership of the Partido Obrero as head of the peasant department.§!"

Converted to the revolutionary cause, Aglipay became chaplain of the provisional government and was the only clergyman to attend the Malolos Congress, for which he was excommunicated by the archbishop of Manila. After the war, Aglipay was convinced by the writer Isabelo de los Reyes to join his movement for a breakaway nationalist church. The Philippine Independent Church was founded in 1902 and Gregorio Aglipay became its first Supreme Bishop. He later succeeded de los Reyes as leader of the progressive Partido Republicano.§!"

Beginning as a legal advisor to the Senate, he won the election to the House of Representatives from the second district of Batangas. Several years later, Recto became floor leader of the Democrata minority in the House, a position that gave him a spot on the independence mission to the United States. Though often attempting to return to practising law and teaching, Recto was always pulled back into the world of politics. He is best known as the primary author of the Philippine Constitution.§!"

 PHI_manuel_luis_quezon: "Manuel Quezon"
 PHI_manuel_luis_quezon_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LAugust 19th, 1878, in Baler, Nueva Ecija Province, Captaincy General of the Philippines§!\n§YBackground:§! §LThe story of Philippine politics since American rule might be the story of one man: Manuel Quezon. Pausing his studies in law to join the Republican Army during the Philippine-American War, Quezon was elected governor of his home province at the age of 28. The next year he was elected to the First Philippine Legislature and became majority floor leader. With Speaker of the House Sergio Osmeña, he founded the Nacionalista Party, which has won every election ever since. Quezon and Osmeña have had a volatile relationship, and their successive feuding and reconciling has dominated political life. But Quezon gained the upper hand, and it was under his aegis that a set date for independence from the United States was finally secured. For this, Quezon handily won the election to become first President of the Philippine Commonwealth.§!"

 PHI_manuel_roxas: "Manuel Roxas"
 PHI_manuel_roxas_leader_desc: "§YBorn:§! §LJanuary 1st, 1892, in Capiz, Capiz Province, Captaincy General of the Philippines§!\n§YBackground:§! §LComing from a large, landowning \"hacendado\" family, Manuel Roxas followed the path of most young upper-class Filipinos at the time and entered law school. Going from Governor of Capiz to the House of Representatives, Roxas became Speaker of the House and entered the front rank of Nacionalista leadership. With Quezon and Osmeña he lobbied the United States for independence in a shifting process where nationalist ambitions mixed with political expediency and personal rivalry. Nonetheless, Roxas kept his place among the top three and became Quezon's secretary of finance.§!"

 PHI_emilio_aguinaldo: "Emilio Aguinaldo"

Nonetheless, he joined the revolutionary secret society Katipunan and became leader of the rebels of Cavite. After winning several victories against the Spanish, the First Philippine Republic was declared with Aguinaldo as President. However, the Spanish counterattack forced Aguinaldo into exile, only returning during the Spanish-American War. The revolutionaries and the Americans soon fell out, and in the ensuing conflict, Aguinaldo's forces were defeated. After surrendering to the Americans, Aguinaldo retired from politics, but remained active in veterans' organisations and has been a living symbol of the revolution.§!"

Lieutenant Santos saw action in two campaigns against the Moros, where he distinguished himself with his leadership and gallantry. When time came for the formation of a true Commonwealth Army, Santos was one of the Constabulary officers who was selected to transfer. In doing so, he was promoted to brigadier general. Rapidly rising through the ranks, he has also proven to be a shockingly capable administrator in his own right with the government considering him for major civilian projects as well.§!"

But after Ramos joined a teachers' strike, Quezon demanded his resignation, causing Ramos to bitterly quit the Nacionalista Party. He started the newspaper \"Sakdal\" which viciously attacked Quezon and the political elite. Ramos's populist style gained him a following, and he eventually formed the Sakdalista movement.§!"

He co-founded the Nacionalista Party along with Quezon, clashing with American authorities. Nevertheless, he was elected to the Senate and became President pro tempore. The pair would split over the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Bill, with Osmeña coming out in support of the bill while Quezon rejected it over several provisions about military bases. This caused schism in the Nacionalista Party, with Quezon's wing gaining the upper hand in the 1934 elections. In 1935, the two wings reconciled and ran under one ticket, with Quezon becoming the first President of the Commonwealth and Osmeña serving as Vice President.§!"

Local elites form intricate webs of alliances bound by family ties, mutual interests, and political patronage. Despite the endemic corruption and opaqueness of the system to the undereducated and impoverished lower classes, the mood of the masses still carries sway. Further complicating the equation is the legacy of American imperialism and how it interacts with the Nacionalista Party."

The economic downturn continues to harm the most vulnerable, however, even if the immediate recovery has proven swifter than previously feared thanks to the Philippines relative isolation from the German economic sphere and existing trauma from the Great Depression."

 PHI_agriculture_1_idea_desc: "The legacy of Spanish and American colonialism has left the Philippines with a highly unequal agricultural sector. Cash crops are a vital part of the Philippine economy, but American economic policies have heavily tied the Philippines to the US. A brief spurt of agricultural modernisation and growth in the 1920s came to a crashing halt with the Great Depression.\n\nTensions between the landowners and their tenants have flared into violence repeatedly over the last few years, causing the rise of various radical groups on the left and right. American and Commonwealth authorities have attempted various reforms to resolve these issues, most recently Quezon's Rice Share Tenancy Act of 1933, however these efforts have been stymied by easily exploitable loopholes, gentry resistance, peasant anger, and the government's inability to please either."

 PHI_industry_1_idea: "Stalled Industrialisation"
 PHI_industry_1_idea_desc: "The Philippines' limited industrial growth has suffered a major setback with the Great Depression, which has stunted its urban development. Foreign investment has dried up, many continue to be out of work, and Philippine financial institutions continue to struggle to find their footing. With most of the economy centred around rural sectors, it has been difficult to muster sufficient political will to push Philippine industry out of the rut."

 PHI_mining_1_idea: "Depressed Resource Extraction"
 PHI_mining_1_idea_desc: "While the bulk of Philippine exports is centred around rice and other crops, the Philippines is also home to major mineral deposits and other natural resources. However, with the Great Depression reducing demand in the United States for raw materials, the mining and logging industries have declined in productivity. Compounded with few resources allocated for infrastructure development, the Philippine economy struggles to keep up with its competitors."

 PHI_form_the_nepa_idea: "The National Economic Protection Association"
 PHI_form_the_nepa_idea_desc: "The National Economic Protection Association is an alliance of patriotic businessmen and civic leaders dedicated to encouraging Filipinos to purchase domestically made products in hopes of reversing the trade deficit."

 PHI_agriculture_populist_plan: "Land Redistribution"
 PHI_agriculture_populist_plan_desc: "$PHI_agriculture_1_idea_desc$\n\nIn a renewed effort to combat social inequality, the Philippine government has pushed for aggressive regulation of tenant-landlord agreements and in some cases even expropriation. It has also encouraged the settlement of publicly owned lands in hopes of creating a new class of small yeomen farmers. Protectionist tariffs have been put into place to help safeguard Philippine farmers from unfriendly foreign competition as the Philippines seeks self sufficiency."

 PHI_agriculture_elite_plan: "Agricultural Modernisation"
 PHI_agriculture_elite_plan_desc: "$PHI_agriculture_1_idea_desc$\n\nIn a renewed effort to create prosperity, the Philippine government has focused on subsidising improvements to farming techniques and technologies - thus increasing efficiency and productivity to create for a competitive export economy. In the long term, this will generate the much needed wealth that will allow the Philippines to develop in a positive direction."

 PHI_industry_populist_plan: "Protecting Local Industry"
 PHI_industry_populist_plan_desc: "$PHI_industry_1_idea_desc$\n\nIn an effort to fan the sparks of domestic industry, the Philippine government has implemented a series of protectionist and sometimes autarkic policies to begin substituting imports with domestic made industrial products. With higher tariffs, increased subsidies, and calls for patriotic purchasing, the Philippines hopes to create a manufacturing base of its own."

 PHI_industry_elite_plan: "International Industrial Investment"
 PHI_industry_elite_plan_desc: "$PHI_industry_1_idea_desc$\n\nIn an effort to jump-start Philippine industrialisation, the Philippine government has begun aggressively courting foreign investment, reducing trade barriers and regulations - including creating special zones dedicated to encouraging economic growth. They seek to further connect the Philippine economy to the outside world, bringing modernity and prosperity."

 PHI_mining_populist_plan: "Prioritising Resource Extraction"
 PHI_mining_populist_plan_desc: "$PHI_mining_1_idea_desc$\n\nThe Philippine government has doubled down on resource extraction, opening up new mines and new forests deep in the countryside to exploitation. This has allowed for an increase in employment and has helped to reverse the trade deficit, though the glut of products entering the market has damaged company profits."

 PHI_mining_elite_plan: "Developing National Infrastructure"
 PHI_mining_elite_plan_desc: "$PHI_mining_1_idea_desc$\n\nThe Philippine government has sought to put unemployed labourers to work repairing and expanding domestic infrastructure, a costly and sometimes exploitative endeavour. Improvements to the transportation networks has made moving Philippine products to port for exports more efficient, to the benefit of existing owners and facilities."

 PHI_foreign_industrial_support_idea: "Foreign Industrial Support"
 PHI_foreign_industrial_support_idea_desc: "In its quest to rebuild its economy, the Philippines has elected to enlist the support of foreign business interests - in many cases with the explicit backing of foreign powers. While this has proven beneficial for economic growth, many wonder if the loss of sovereignty will be worth it in the long run."

### Military Ideas ###
 PHI_army_1: "A Newborn Army"
 PHI_army_intro: "After the destruction of the Philippine Revolutionary Army during the Philippine-American War, American authorities avoided allowing a standing Philippine army. The closest equivalent was the Philippine Constabulary, a gendarmerie assigned to putting down local rebellions, and the Philippine Scouts which included Filipinos working for the US Army. It was not until the National Defence Act of 1935 that the Armed Forces of the Philippines was formally established, and the Army of the Philippines along with the Council of National Defence was thus born on December 21st, just a month after the establishment of the Commonwealth."
 PHI_army_1_desc: "$PHI_army_intro$\n\nAs long as the United States maintains its hold on the Philippines, the islands are safe from foreign threats, but what would happen if they were to become distracted?"

 PHI_army_2: "Army Growing Pains"
 PHI_army_2_desc: "$PHI_army_intro$\n\nThe expansion of this new Philippine Army has proven quite difficult, despite the ambitious agenda of Philippine and American planners. The Army and its reserves have swelled in size, rapidly outpacing the infrastructure available to train them. New training camps had to be erected, and instructors drawn from the Constabulary and the Scouts."

 PHI_army_3a: "An Army Along American Lines"
 PHI_army_3a_desc: "$PHI_army_intro$\n\nThe Philippine Army continues to develop along the same lines drawn by American military planners in 1935. Led by many West Point trained military officers, the emphasis has been on military professionalism. This program has begun by reorganising the Philippine Constabulary into the Constabulary Division, establishing a core for the new army to work out of."

 PHI_army_4a: "An Army Along American Lines"
 PHI_army_4a_desc: "$PHI_army_3a_desc$\n\nWith the core of the Philippine Army prepared, expanded infantry training programs and the creation of reserves has been the priority in order to get the Philippine Army to full strength. In addition, artillery and specialised training have begun being offered at forts near Manila."

 PHI_army_5a: "The Philippine Army"
 PHI_army_5a_desc: "$PHI_army_4a_desc$\n\nThe Philippine Army has finally reached maturity. Though planned along American lines, it was the heroic effort of Filipinos that built it. With modern, well trained and well equipped divisions surrounding an elite core, the Philippines is capable of fighting any conflict both near and afar. This army is now capable of addressing challenges the nation faces, and taking initiative against any enemy!"

 PHI_army_3b: "Legacy of the Revolutionary Army"
 PHI_army_3b_desc: "$PHI_army_intro$\n\nDeviating somewhat from the plans drawn by the Americans in 1935, which in the government's eyes continued to treat the Philippine Army as auxiliaries, the Philippine General Staff have ordered their army to take lessons from the old Philippine Revolutionary Army and its prolonged resistance in the Philippine-American War. Rather than a style of war inappropriate for our conditions and reliant on the ultimate arrival of American reinforcements, the Philippine Army is to be built to hold out on its own accord. No matter the cost."

 PHI_army_4b: "Legacy of the Revolutionary Army"
 PHI_army_4b_desc: "$PHI_army_3b_desc$\n\nTo facilitate this process, a large number of reserves have been rapidly trained and local stay-behind cells planted around the country. New orders for weaponry and grants for military production plans have been distributed. Above all, the people must be prepared to help shoulder the burden of defending the nation."

 PHI_army_5b: "The Philippine Army"
 PHI_army_5b_desc: "$PHI_army_4b_desc$\n\nThe Philippines may be vulnerable to invasion from all sides by sea, but the Philippine Army is ready for the task. With a dispersed and semi-autonomous array of units capable of taking advantage of local terrain, they can pin down and swarm invaders before a beachhead can be established. And should the unthinkable happen, contingencies are in place to ensure individual units can keep fighting. Lifted by the Spirit of 1899, the Philippine Army will keep the Philippines free!"

 PHI_from_hooves_to_tires_idea: "From Hooves to Tires"
 PHI_from_hooves_to_tires_idea_desc: "Mobility has always been vital in warfare, and the mass production of cars and trucks has offered new possibilities both in supplying our troops and ferrying them into key points in battle."

 PHI_domestic_rifle_production_idea: "Domestic Rifle Production"
 PHI_domestic_rifle_production_idea_desc: "The Philippines has traditionally purchased its arms from abroad, however with the world becoming divided and hostile, relying solely on foreign imports is no longer an option. At the very least we must work to expand our rifle and ammunition production capabilities at home."

 PHI_prepare_for_the_storm_idea: "Preparing for the Storm"
 PHI_prepare_for_the_storm_idea_desc: "With war seemingly imminent in the Pacific and the Philippine military woefully underprepared, the Philippine government has offered a carte blanche to the Council of National Defence to bring the army up to speed. Some say this crash militarisation program is too little, too late but surely something is better than nothing."

 PHI_lessons_from_the_revolution_idea: "Lessons from the Revolution"
 PHI_lessons_from_the_revolution_idea_desc: "The Philippine Revolution and the Philippine-American war both demonstrated that though always outgunned by our opponents, the tenacity and courage of our fighters can force our foes to the negotiating table and sometimes even topple empires."

 PHI_air_industry_idea: "Growing Air Industry"
 PHI_air_industry_idea_desc: "The Philippine Air industry is a small one, but between the determination of our people and extensive government funding we have managed to acquire a steady stream of planes to defend our skies."

 PHI_guardians_of_our_precious_skies_idea: "The Philippine Air Force"
 PHI_guardians_of_our_precious_skies_idea_desc: "By executive order of the President, the Philippine Army Air Corps has been raised into the Philippine Air Force. The brave pilots and tireless ground staff of this new and equal branch of the Philippine Armed forces have been tasked with guarding the skies over the Philippines. Long may they soar!"

 PHI_expand_naval_production_idea: "Expanding Naval Production"
 PHI_expand_naval_production_idea_desc: "The Philippines has long lacked a naval force of its own, the closest being the Filipino manned Offshore Patrol, a branch of the United States Navy. With our independence, we can no longer rely on others to defend our shores, especially as an island archipelago. It will be costly, but a fleet must be quickly created from scratch if we are to protect our homes from invasion."

 PHI_navy_spirit_idea: "The Philippine Navy"
 PHI_navy_spirit_idea_desc: "In recognition of how far we have come, the President has formally announced the renaming of the Philippine Naval Patrol to the Philippine Navy. Our brave sailors stand ready to defend the shores and patrol the waves against all that threaten our people."

 PHI_foreign_military_mission: "Foreign Military Mission"
 PHI_foreign_military_mission_desc: "The Philippine Army is a brand new institution, first authorised in December 1935 and building off a small core of Philippine Constabulary and Philippine Scouts Veterans. In order to facilitate the rapid expansion needed to defend the new Republic, the Philippines has accepted foreign advisors from more mature armies to help with the transition"

 #Industrial Concerns
 PHI_national_development_company: "NDC"
 PHI_national_development_company_desc: "The National Development Company was founded in 1919 as the \"Compania de Fomento Nacional\", one of the Philippine's earliest companies. A state-owned corporation, recent legislation gave it its current name and an expanded mandate to invest government capital, develop natural resources, and build new industries. Its portfolios include shipping, aviation, steel, copper electronics, textiles, sugar, and much more."

 PHI_philippine_national_bank: "PNB"
 PHI_philippine_national_bank_desc: "The Philippine National Bank was established in 1916 as a government-owned bank dedicated to providing financial loans in support of economic development. Serving both the industrial and agricultural sector, it nearly faced bankruptcy in the 1920s due to chronic mismanagement, causing the 1921 financial crisis. Possessing the special power to issue circulating notes, the PNB was the de facto central bank and treasury of the Philippines. Though a true central bank has now been established as the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the PNB's influence endures."

 PHI_manila_railroad_company: "MRC"
 PHI_manila_railroad_company_desc: "Founded in 1887 and incorporated in 1892, the Manila Railroad Company has a long and storied history that predates the Philippine Revolution. Amid the Great War, the insular government acquired the British run Manila Railway Company (1906) Limited and the Manila Railroad Company of New Jersey, reorganising them into one government owned Manila Railway Company. Modernisation efforts have included upgrading railcars, electrifying the railroads, designing new stations and even producing locomotives of their own."

 PHI_national_power_corporation: "NPC"
 PHI_national_power_corporation_desc: "The National Power Corporation was recently established when the government nationalised the hydroelectric industry, including all power generated from lakes, streams, and springs. It has been tasked with electrifying the Philippines, especially in rural areas."

 PHI_benguet_consolidated_mining_company: "BCMC"
 PHI_benguet_consolidated_mining_company_desc: "The Benguet Consolidated Mining Company was founded by three American soldiers in 1903, making it the oldest mining company in the country. Operating gold mines in the namesake Benguet province as well as Camarines Norte province, it also controls chromite and copper mines in other parts of the country. There is also talk of expansion of the company expanding into forestry and trucking with government help."

 PHI_standard_oil: "Stanvac"
 PHI_standard_oil_desc: "In 1933, the Socony-Vacuum Oil Company (Standard Oil of New York) and Standard Oil of New Jersey (Jersey Standard) merged their far Eastern interests into one joint venture known as the Standard Vacuum Oil Company. Operating in dozens of countries, the Philippines branch has sought to win lucrative government bids to establish new oil refineries in the Philippines."

 PHI_mitsui: "Mitsui"

 PHI_squires_bingham_co: "Squires Bingham"
 PHI_squires_bingham_co_desc: "Squires Bingham & Co began as a print shop in Manila, which then expanded to selling foreign motorcycles and sporting goods. This included selling hunting files and ammunition, and it was in prime position (with the help of some enterprising investors) to begin making rifles to meet the sudden government demand for domestically produced firearms."

 PHI_yutivo_corporation: "Yutivo"
 PHI_yutivo_corporation_desc: "The Yutivo Corporation was founded in 1887, and assembled imported cars from a variety of international manufacturers including Chevrolet, Opel, Holden, Vauxhall, Buick, and Isuzu. A government push for local automobile manufacturing has allowed Yutivo to expand into a defence contracting firm thanks to generous subsidies."

 PHI_krupp_ost_asien_artillery: "Krupp"
 PHI_krupp_ost_asien_artillery_desc: "Krupp is a German company founded as a steel foundry in 1811. Its entry into the world of military manufacturing began with its first production of steel canons for the Russian, Turkish, and Prussian armies, and it ballooned in size after German reunification. In the present day it is known for producing ships, submarines, tanks, and artillery. With the rise in German influence in East Asia following the Great War, Krupp has followed the empire into the Pacific."

 PHI_ford_motor_company: "Ford"

While not exceptionally successful, lucrative government subsidies have allowed it to remain a contender for military contracts."

 PHI_nakajima: "Nakajima"
 PHI_nakajima_desc: "Nakajima Aircraft Company was founded in 1918 by Nakajima Chikuhei, a naval engineer, who bought out his co-founded a year later. Close and early cooperation with the Imperial Japanese Army has allowed it to expand to multiple plants across Japan, and made it a leading military aircraft designer and producer."

 PHI_continue_philippinisation: "Continue Philippinisation"
 PHI_continue_philippinisation_desc: "Besides independence, the Nacionalistas' chief goal from the very beginning has been the replacement of Americans in government positions with Filipinos. The Jones Act of 1916 gave the native legislature power to put most of the civil service in Philippine hands, but since then, an American contingent has lingered. With mounting troubles in the United States, now is a good time to complete Philippinisation once and for all."

 PHI_national_council_for_education: "National Council For Education"
 PHI_national_council_for_education_desc: "Though not without its many faults, the system of education instituted by the Americans was, arguably, one of the more positive results of their administration. But time has changed since 1902, and so have the educational needs of our people. It is time to convene a National Council of Education, staffed by an appointed expert, to advise the President and the Department of Public Instruction on the necessary educational reforms."

 PHI_eight_hour_labour_law: "Pass the Eight-Hour Labour Law"
 PHI_eight_hour_labour_law_desc: "For decades, the campaign for an eight hour workday has been pursued by labour movements the world over. This is not some crypto-syndicalist movement either; most advanced countries have adopted an eight hour day. It is high time that the Philippines joins the ranks of these civilised nations, and proves to the Philippine workers that the Nacionalista Party is their friend and protector."

 PHI_social_justice_campaign: "Social Justice Campaign"
 PHI_social_justice_campaign_desc: "What is \"social justice\"? Is it a doctrine derived from papal encyclicals? Is it an innovation of progressive legal philosophy? The average Filipino does not need to worry himself with such high-flown questions. All he must know is this: President Quezon is the defender of the common welfare, friend of the poor and downtrodden, and works tirelessly to uplift the masses to a higher form of living."

 PHI_government_survey_board: "Government Survey Board"
 PHI_government_survey_board_desc: "A government run like hell by Filipinos may be preferable to one run like heaven by Americans, but, admittedly, it would be nice if a Filipino government could be run like heaven too. Our institutions probably have some inefficiencies and redundancies, and in order to address these we will need to have a better picture of the government as a whole."

 PHI_optional_religious_instruction: "Optional Religious Instruction"
 PHI_optional_religious_instruction_desc: "The Philippines is an overwhelmingly Catholic country. At the same time, the Philippine Revolution was in large part a revolt against the Spanish friars, and the Philippine Constitution established the separation of church and state. Some of our more pious citizens have been demanding religious (that is, Catholic) instruction in schools. We can find a middle ground here: religious classes will be optional and will not interfere with the rest of the school day."

 PHI_patronise_the_deutsche_klub: "Patronise the Deutscher Klub"
 PHI_patronise_the_deutsche_klub_desc: "The German community in Manila is long-established. Though formerly small, it has swelled in size along with the German presence in the Far East. Though official business with the Kaiserreich is conducted through the Imperial German Consulate, the centre of the German community lies in the swanky Deutscher Klub, where the businessmen with connections to Singapore and Hanoi can be found. It's time that we paid the club a visit."

 PHI_friends_not_forgotten: "Friends Not Forgotten"
 PHI_friends_not_forgotten_desc: "One might think that we Filipinos bear a grudge against the United States for its occupation. Though we guard our independence fiercely, we are also magnanimous. Despite our differences, we have made many American friends, and our hearts go out to them as their homeland is wracked with turmoil and destruction. When the day comes that their national nightmare is over, we will be waiting with an extended hand."

 PHI_visit_from_the_ijn: "Visit from the IJN"
 PHI_visit_from_the_ijn_desc: "The Philippines has no navy of its own as of yet, and in the event that the United States Navy can no longer protect us, our archipelagic country is extremely vulnerable. That is one reason we value our friendship with the Empire of Japan, for its mighty fleet keeps the peace and order in the Western Pacific. Let us dispatch a cable to Tokyo inviting a Japanese squadron to stop by in Manila Bay; we will give them a state welcome."

 PHI_more_government_less_politics: "\"More Government, Less Politics\""
 PHI_more_government_less_politics_desc: "There is much talk in the opposition about the state of our politics, questioning continued Nacionalista rule. Need we remind them that every achievement of the insular government occurred under our leadership, that the Commonwealth has been consolidated and independence gained under President Quezon? Our administration does not deign to fall into these political squabbles; we are here to deliver good government for Filipinos everywhere."

 PHI_nineteenthirtynine_elections: "The 1939 Philippine Elections"
 PHI_nineteenthirtynine_elections_desc: "For the first time in its history, the Philippines will conduct a presidential election as a free and independent republic. With President Manuel Quezon attempting to continue the Nacionalistas' long-standing hegemony over the government, local Nacionalista bosses will do all that they can to drive up the vote. But the opposition has organised too. The only question is, will it be enough to win?"

 PHI_to_the_victors_go_the_spoils_desc: "Before this election, observers wondered if Manuel Quezon's unbroken string of victories might finally come to an end. It seems that their prognostications were mere wishful thinking. President Quezon has once again proven himself the master of Philippine politics, and his position and legacy is more secure than ever. Not that he intends to rest on his laurels. There is still plenty to do: laws to pass, patronage to dispense, and speeches to make."

 PHI_industrial_arbirtration: "Industrial Arbitration"
 PHI_industrial_arbirtration_desc: "As the Philippine economy develops, industrial disputes between the growing working class and their employers become a growing problem. Strikes are bad for the country, for not only do they disrupt production, but they are also opportunities for syndicalist agitators to further infiltrate the labour movement. The government should instead be the keeper of industrial peace; we will establish an industrial court with jurisdiction over labour disputes."

 PHI_open_more_public_schools: "Open More Public Schools"
 PHI_open_more_public_schools_desc: "Our educational system is as modernised as that of any Western country. Its chief flaw is that its reach remains too short. Great numbers of Filipinos remain illiterate, and there are still not enough schools to serve the growing population, especially in rural areas. More primary schools will be constructed until we are certain that every barrio in the country is covered."

 PHI_plebiscite_on_womens_suffrage: "Plebiscite on Women's Suffrage"
 PHI_plebiscite_on_womens_suffrage_desc: "The Constitution of the Philippines did not go so far as to grant women suffrage, but it did include a provision for a binding plebiscite on the issue. Uniquely, the plebiscite will poll Filipino women only on the matter of whether they should get the vote. Suffragists have been lobbying the government to conduct the plebiscite, so it is time to take action; a positive result seems guaranteed."

 PHI_expand_the_council_of_state: "Expand the Council of State"
 PHI_expand_the_council_of_state_desc: "The Council of State was originally created in the territorial period to advise the American-appointed governor-general. It originally included the Speaker of the House, the Senate President, and the heads of the executive departments. However, the state has grown since then, and more of its arms should be represented on the council. The army chief of staff, presidential secretary, and heads of important public corporations will be added."

 PHI_reserve_officers_training_corps: "Reserve Officers' Training Corps"
 PHI_reserve_officers_training_corps_desc: "Following the American model, the University of the Philippines established the country's first official ROTC unit in 1922. With a growing military and defence needs, the demand for officers is higher than ever. Henceforth, all colleges and universities with enrolment greater than one hundred will be required to form their own ROTC."

 PHI_the_national_dream_fulfilled: "The National Dream Fulfilled"
 PHI_the_national_dream_fulfilled_desc: "From the abject defeat in its war against the United States in 1902, the Philippine nation has slowly emerged from the state of servitude. It has been a long struggle, yes, and not without reverses and compromises, but today we see that the course we took was justified, and the fruits of our labour well worth it. The Philippines is a nation once more: free, unshackled, in control of its destiny."

 PHI_a_modern_philippines: "A Modern Philippines"
 PHI_a_modern_philippines_desc: "Our former masters called thought us \"primitive\", but it was they who were responsible for our rude state. Was it not the Spanish who chained us with reaction and religious obscurantism? Was it not the Americans who fettered us with economic backwardness? In truth, the Filipinos are a forward-looking people, ever eager to engage with the modern world and take up the latest technological and social advancements."

 PHI_hub_of_the_pacific: "Hub of the Pacific"
 PHI_hub_of_the_pacific_desc: "Formerly the axis of world politics revolved around Europe, but that may not stand forever. Japan is a great power, and China is awakening from its slumber. The Pacific region plays an increasingly large role in the world economy, and where wealth flows, power follows. The Philippines may never be one of the great nations of the world, but with its strategic position at the centre of the Western Pacific, it may yet be an indispensable one."

 PHI_a_proper_diplomatic_service: "A Proper Diplomatic Service"
 PHI_a_proper_diplomatic_service_desc: "Of all deprivations of American rule to the development of our government, the greatest was its restriction on our country's ability to conduct its own foreign affairs. With our independence coming quite suddenly, we now face the important task of establishing ourselves on the world stage. Our Department of Foreign Affairs is growing, and many of our best and brightest are lining up to serve it."

 PHI_coalition_of_the_oppressed_masses_desc: "The bourgeoisie has been overthrown. It may be said that the masses only have a dim understanding of what they have just accomplished, but that should not detract from their achievement. The act is proof enough that the workers and peasants of the Philippines, dimly groping towards class consciousness, have already advanced far enough to fight and triumph over their oppressors. We shall guide them toward the future."

 PHI_create_labour_colleges: "Create Labour Colleges"
 PHI_create_labour_colleges_desc: "Though we are winning the struggle against capitalism, there is another struggle we must take up: the struggle against ignorance. There is much the masses will need to learn, from basic reading and arithmetic, to technical and agricultural knowledge, to a real understanding of what socialism and syndicalism stand for. In the great revolutionary states of Europe, they addressed this by creating labour colleges for adult education; we shall import this model."

 PHI_break_up_the_haciendas: "Break up the Haciendas"
 PHI_break_up_the_haciendas_desc: "The Philippines, having not yet developed a large capitalist class, has been dominated by the great landowners. They have lorded over the peasantry, keeping them in feudal bondage and debt-slavery. Most peasants did little more than dream of a gentler, more forgiving master, but are here to tell them that they can dream bigger. The haciendas, the great estates, will be immediately expropriated without compensation. The land belongs to the people."

 PHI_moulding_the_revolutionary_woman: "Moulding the Revolutionary Woman"
 PHI_moulding_the_revolutionary_woman_desc: "The movement for women's rights in the Philippines has been heretofore led by bourgeois activists focused on bourgeois issues. Some suffrage here or some law reform there will not serve to liberate women. The woman of the Philippines must understand that the revolution will abolish the capitalist family structure and its oppressions. It may take a long time in practice, but it is the goal we are ever striving towards."

 PHI_dictatorship_of_labour: "Dictatorship of Labour"
 PHI_dictatorship_of_labour_desc: "For years, both our American masters and their Nacionalista lackeys shrugged off the oppression of the workers with claims that the Philippines was a democracy, and that change should come from the ballot box. But there is no value in capitalist democracy, which gives the worker the freedom only to choose which boot shall weigh upon his neck. Democracy's time has passed; only the dictatorship of the working class can dismantle the capitalist system."

Really, without the KPMP to rally the peasants, there would be no revolution at all in a country as rural as the Philippines. Even if we desire to industrialise the Philippines, it will remain a chiefly agrarian country for a long time, and as such cooperation with the KPMP will serve us well."

 PHI_create_a_peoples_army_desc: "Professional militaries are the tools of the bourgeois state in oppressing the people; one need only look at the Philippine Constabulary to see such an example. The revolution was carried out by the workers and peasants arming and organising themselves, and it was their élan that won the day. Existing militias will be reorganised into the People's Army, which will be the new means of defence for our nation."

 PHI_true_independence: "True Independence"
 PHI_true_independence_desc: "Again and again, the Nacionalistas promised independence from American imperialism. But when it finally arrived, what a lie it was. Appeals to sovereignty are meaningless in the face of the capitalist-imperialist system with which the Philippines remained enmeshed. It is only the revolution that has finally brought us true independence: independence from capital, freedom to join hands with all the revolutionary workers of the world."

 PHI_the_internationalist_outlook: "The Internationalist Outlook"
 PHI_the_internationalist_outlook_desc: "Since the revolution, we have been busy looking inward, attempting to establish the institutions of socialism in the Philippines. We have received much aid from other socialist countries, and now we have reached a stage where we can begin looking outward. For the international revolution demands participation from proletariat all over the world, and it is time we did our part."

 PHI_the_destruction_of_imperialism: "The Destruction of Imperialism"
 PHI_the_destruction_of_imperialism_desc: "Socialism has been secured for us, but the great challenge remains. The rising tide of the colonised peoples of the world is prepared to overthrow capitalist imperialism under the banner of revolutionary socialism. The Philippines may be a small nation, but do not forget: we rose up against imperialism once before and created the first republic in Asia. Our role to play in the coming endeavour will be a glorious one."

 ### Recto ###
 PHI_evolution_not_revolution: "Evolution not Revolution"
 PHI_evolution_not_revolution_desc: "For the first time in the history of Philippine democracy, the Nacionalistas have been voted out of power. President Recto pledges to transform the country, and correct the abuses of the previous government. But this is not a repudiation of the past; far from it. We are building upon the foundations laid by those who came before us, secure in our belief that a better Philippines can be made. In this orderly transfer of power, Philippine democracy has been consecrated."

 PHI_promote_public_welfare: "Promote Public Welfare"
 PHI_promote_public_welfare_desc: "In a modern society, the state has an obligation to care for its citizens, promoting the general standard of living and therefore assuring social peace and security. The Bureau of Public Welfare has already been doing good work, but there is much room for expansion. As our tax revenues increase, we can put aside spending for old-age pensions, child care, and support for the jobless."

 PHI_new_medium_of_instruction: "New Medium of Instruction"
 PHI_new_medium_of_instruction_desc: "The Constitution designated English and Spanish for official usage, but contained a provision to begin the process of designating a national language. Under the last administration, the Institute of National Language resolved that a standardised form of Tagalog would become the language of the Philippines. Now comes the task of turning these words into reality. All public schooling will henceforth be conducted in Filipino, thus educating our youth in the new national language."

 PHI_domestic_relations_and_probate_courts: "Domestic Relations and Probate Courts"
 PHI_domestic_relations_and_probate_courts_desc: "The women of the Philippines, having been granted the right to vote, continue to eagerly advocate the expansion of their civil rights. As the place of women continues to be in the home and in the family, the protection of their rights vis-à-vis their husbands and dependents is their chief concern. Special courts dealing with domestic relations will be established to adjudicate this."

 PHI_provincial_autonomy: "Provincial Autonomy"
 PHI_provincial_autonomy_desc: "As President, Quezon saw no issue with the gathering of executive power around himself, the better to lord over the system of patronage and hierarchy that rules Philippine politics. However, it is now clear that such a top-heavy administration is inefficient and unresponsive to the needs of ordinary Filipinos. Many of the central government's functions can be removed from Manila to the provincial administrations, spreading the civil service more evenly around the country."

 PHI_protect_press_freedoms: "Protect Press Freedoms"
 PHI_protect_press_freedoms_desc: "An irreplaceable principle of liberal democracy is freedom of speech and of the press. These freedoms have been enshrined in our constitution, but they are not always truly followed. The powerful have used libel laws to silence critics, and the government has suppressed that which it deems subversive in the name of state security. These abuses cannot be allowed to continue if we are to have a truly free society."

 PHI_cement_military_political_divide: "Cement Military-Political Divide"
 PHI_cement_military_political_divide_desc: "The creation of our own armed forces has been indispensable in the development of our national defence capabilities. However, we must not allow an increasingly large and well-funded army to begin thinking that it is an independent actor that may dictate its desires to the elected government. Our army chiefs will answer to civilian officials in their capacity as representatives of the people."

 PHI_break_the_colonial_pattern: "Break the Colonial Pattern"
 PHI_break_the_colonial_pattern_desc: "The colonial legacy weighs heavily upon the Philippines. Though we have by measures secured political sovereignty, the imprint of colonialism was still felt upon our economy, our society, our system of government. The colonial mentality lies still upon the minds of the people, but this will not hold forever. Little by little, we are liberating ourselves from the chains of the past, becoming independent in outlook as well as fact."

 PHI_assert_our_independence: "Assert our Independence"
 PHI_assert_our_independence_desc: "Having finally emerged from American dominion, we pledge to never again let ourselves become bonded to a foreign overlord. We are willing to form friendships with other nations, and to form relationships in the name of cooperation of mutual security. But the Philippines will not be put in the pocket of some greater power; we alone will determine our destiny and place in the world."

 PHI_the_unconquerable_faith: "The Unconquerable Faith"
 PHI_the_unconquerable_faith_desc: "The Philippine Revolution began with an idea, a dream of freedom, justice, and the creation of an independent Philippine nation. Since those days, the Philippine people have worked and fought tirelessly to make those dreams come true. In those struggles, they faced a growing cynicism borne of the difficulties of forging a fair and democratic government. Let no one doubt the reality of our achievement, so that the Filipinos never lose their idealism and faith in the nation."

 ### Roxas ###
 PHI_a_steady_hand: "A Steady Hand"
 PHI_a_steady_hand_desc: "The Nacionalista Party has been the guardian of Philippine democracy for decades now. It has ensured stability and continuity of government, protecting the country from disorder and chaos. In recent years, populist rabble-rousers have attempted to pull the nation towards anarchy, and the previous government foolishly caved to their demands. There will be no more of that; the Nacionalistas stand once more for sound, sensible government."

 PHI_consolidate_the_university_of_the_philippines_desc: "Our national university is the pride of the nation, giving our best and brightest a world-class education so that they are prepared to become the future leaders of the Philippines. As the university has expanded, colleges have had to occupy buildings wherever they happened to be available around Manila. With the relocation of all the colleges to a single, expanded campus, the University of the Philippines will be able to grow."

 PHI_security_through_patronage: "Security Through Patronage"
 PHI_security_through_patronage_desc: "Philippine society is underwritten by the mutual obligations between social groups. If the lower classes serve the elites as tenants or workers, the elites are also expected to have a certain noblesse oblige and dispense favours to those who are under them through things like gifts, loans, and debt forgiveness. Though not codified by law and considered \"corrupt\" by some, this has always been the way of keeping the social peace in the Philippines."

 PHI_model_of_filipino_womanhood: "Model of Filipino Womanhood"
 PHI_model_of_filipino_womanhood_desc: "The women of the Philippines are having greater aspirations; this is good. Women have always played a key role in society as guardians of the domestic sphere. They should be encouraged to cultivate their education, their virtues, and their social graces, for in this they will exert a wholesome and stabilising influence upon Philippine men."

 PHI_expel_subversives: "Expel Subversives"
 PHI_expel_subversives_desc: "Though the Philippines is proud to be a democratic and liberal society, we do not allow political freedoms to be abused. Recently, destructive and anti-state activists have become bolder in attempting to grasp political power. Many are reds, some are religious fanatics; it is all the same. We will not allow them to manipulate the ignorant masses. Let them seethe and rage all they want, so long as they do it with the door to Congress slammed shut behind them."

 PHI_greasing_the_wheels: "Greasing the Wheels"
 PHI_greasing_the_wheels_desc: "In politics, it's all about who you know. What the reformers fail to appreciate is that no one gives something up without getting something in return. Instead of battering your head against the status quo, it's better to learn to swim with the current to your advantage. From our spot at the top of the national hierarchy, we can call in favours in every province and barrio in the country."

 PHI_expand_the_constabulary: "Expand the Constabulary"
 PHI_expand_the_constabulary_desc: "The Army may be responsible for national defence, but law enforcement and the maintenance of peace and order is the domain of the Philippine Constabulary. Though local police may have their own place, as a national force, the Constabulary is the prime implement against the threat of disorder from peasant and worker agitators. It should be expanded to deal with this growing threat."

 PHI_unification_of_politics: "Unification of Politics"
 PHI_unification_of_politics_desc: "Some might say that competitive, multiparty democracy is the precondition of a flourishing liberal society, but is that really true? The simple fact of the matter is that the Nacionalista Party has led Philippine politics from its very inception, and every attempt to cobble together a viable opposition movement has failed. This need not be seen as a bad thing. Under steady Nacionalista rule, all parts of the country work together in harmony."

 PHI_agreement_of_mutual_benefits: "Agreement of Mutual Benefits"
 PHI_agreement_of_mutual_benefits_desc: "The Americans drove a hard bargain: though they gave us some things, they took plenty in return. We are glad to have gotten out from under their thumb, but this does not mean that we have turned hostile to the US, or any other great power for that matter. There are plenty of players on the world stage today vying for our attention, and we would do well to go into business with them, so long as we can strike a good deal."

 PHI_our_seat_at_the_table: "Our Seat at the Table"
 PHI_our_seat_at_the_table_desc: "It is a difficult task to earn respect. For a long while, the Philippine Republic was viewed as an upstart nation, a struggling American colony which received its independence almost by a fluke. It has taken a great deal of effort to change this perception, but our diplomacy and national progress have finally borne fruit. The Philippines is now fully accepted and respected, with influence of its own to throw around."

They have robbed and cheated; for years they painted themselves as champions of independence while being the Americans' faithful lackeys. It is time to throw them off. We are not politicians. Our movement is not a political party aiming to perpetuate its own power. Everything we do is in selfless service to the people."

 PHI_vocational_and_nationalist_education: "Vocational and Nationalist Education"
 PHI_vocational_and_nationalist_education_desc: "The schools of the Philippines have been poisoned by Western models of instruction and curriculum, becoming factories where the English language was drilled into our children's heads. What the Filipinos need is practical knowledge, knowledge to succeed in trades and knowledge to build up this country. Above all, they must be taught to love and serve the nation."

 PHI_improve_working_class_housing: "Improve Working Class Housing"
 PHI_improve_working_class_housing_desc: "The average Filipino lives in poor accommodation, whether that be the hovels of the country barrios or the growing slums of Manila. Meanwhile, the politicians have lived in mansions. A strong and healthy people requires good, hygienic housing. Let us begin a campaign to build new, better housing for the lower classes."

 PHI_mothers_of_the_nation: "Mothers of the Nation"
 PHI_mothers_of_the_nation_desc: "The Filipino woman has a glorious history. She revolted against the Spanish oppressor. She resisted the American invader. She has castigated her man when he has shied away from his national duty. The role of the Filipino woman in national life should be honoured and cultivated. They are our sisters, and the mothers of the future generation."

 PHI_cooperation_of_labour_and_capital: "Cooperation of Labour and Capital"
 PHI_cooperation_of_labour_and_capital_desc: "It is true that the economic elites of this country have exploited the working class in many ways. It is also true that syndicalist agitators have used the slogan of \"class warfare\" to sow discord and division. The constant warfare between labour and capital will never bring prosperity and peace. The two must join together and learn to cooperate, putting aside rancour and enmity in the name of the national interest."

 PHI_spirit_of_ninety_six: "The Spirit of '96"
 PHI_spirit_of_ninety_six_desc: "In 1896, the Philippine Revolution was launched. It gave us a pantheon of national heroes whose legacy inspires us to this very day. But too many of the old have forgotten, and too many of the young are ignorant of this history. We cannot allow the nation to lose its spirit, to become complacent and decadent. We must look back to those great patriots of the past, and emulate their example as we strive boldly towards the future."

 PHI_spirit_of_national_defense: "System of National Defence"
 PHI_spirit_of_national_defense_desc: "It is not enough to desire independence; it must be backed up by military force. We must do our utmost to prevent a foreign power from ever again threatening our sovereignty. All able-bodied males must be made ready for military service and trained in the art of war. The country must be prepared for mobilisation at a moment's notice, with plans ready on how to marshal our manpower and material to its fullest effect."

 PHI_philippines_unbowed: "Philippines Unbowed"
 PHI_philippines_unbowed_desc: "Only yesterday, the Philippines was a servile state: if not to its former American masters, then to a corrupt and selfish political class that betrayed the national interest. Those days are over. We have recovered our dignity, and swept away the corruption of party politics. We have built a government that serves all Filipinos, and that all Filipinos are proud to serve."

 PHI_pan_asian_propaganda: "Pan Asian Propaganda"

From our brotherhood with the Malay peoples to our south, to our Chinese and Japanese communities, we squarely belong in the Eastern world. The struggle of all the Asian nations against imperialism is our struggle, and we look forward to the day when all will stand together as one."

 PHI_the_glorious_republic: "The Glorious Republic"
 PHI_the_glorious_republic_desc: "From subjection, from poverty, from apathy, the Philippines is once again the pearl of the Orient. Our greatness shines across the Pacific, heartening our friends and cowing our enemies. The First Republic born at Malolos has risen from the ashes, grander than we could have ever imagined. The Filipino people may be just proud of their nation, that which they serve selflessly, eagerly, never failing to give their existence to the beloved fatherland."

 PHI_the_archipelagic_struggle: "The Archipelagic Struggle"
 PHI_the_archipelagic_struggle_desc: "Having hundreds of separate islands has been a boon and a curse to the Philippine nation. Many colonial overlords found that pacifying the islands was difficult as a result of our geography, but it has also caused us trouble by making it difficult for our military to be deployed around the country.

Inspired by efforts within the United States, the Army has decided to create the Army Air Corps in order to foster the enthusiasm and interest in national air defence."

 PHI_seek_foreign_expertise: "Seek Foreign Expertise"
 PHI_seek_foreign_expertise_desc: "The German Empire and the Empire of Japan possess some of the most elite plane designs in the world. Along with American designs, it is important that we learn from the best when developing our own air force."

 PHI_naval_air_integration: "Naval Air Integration"
 PHI_naval_air_integration_desc: "The consequences of land-air integration during the first world war have shown the potential for naval and air forces to be linked together in combat as well. Naval dive bombers equipped with torpedoes would serve to strengthen the ties between the Navy and the Air Corps and allow us to strike enemy naval forces without the presence of large battleships and cruisers."

 PHI_expand_air_defence_installations: "Expand Air Defence Installations"
 PHI_expand_air_defence_installations_desc: "In the event of an invasion of the Philippines, the enemy will likely seek to gain control of our skies. We cannot allow this to happen. New innovation and technology such as RADAR stations must be present on the main islands and air bases renovated in order to allow the Air Corps to defend our skies."

 PHI_create_the_special_forces_regiment: "Create the Special Forces Regiment"
 PHI_create_the_special_forces_regiment_desc: "European and American military doctrines have invested in the concept of paratroopers; soldiers who jump out of aircraft and use parachutes to secure areas not directly accessible by other transports. Given the distance between the islands in the Philippines, a training programme to create a special forces regiment dedicated to such actions will be vital to our national defence."

 PHI_promoting_young_aces: "Promoting Young Aces"
 PHI_promoting_young_aces_desc: "With global tensions so high, it's clear that we will likely have to fight for our nation's existence in the coming years. As such, the foremost ranks and top of the classes should be promoted at once in order to become the leading generation of Filipino pilots and aces."

 PHI_invest_in_a_domestic_aviation_industry: "Invest in a Domestic Aviation Industry"
 PHI_invest_in_a_domestic_aviation_industry_desc: "The existence of a domestic aviation industry within the Philippines is small for a country in Asia and abysmal compared to western standards. With the threat of conflict ever so near, we should seek to modernise and develop a domestic aviation industry."

 PHI_expand_island_airbases: "Expand Island Airbases"
 PHI_expand_island_airbases_desc: "In order to expand island defences especially for the air, we have started an ambitious programme to renovate and develop new air fields such as Del Carmen Airfield, Clark Field, Iba Airfield, Del Monte Airfield, Bataan Airfield, and Nichols Field."

 PHI_create_the_bomber_wing: "Create the Bomber Wing"
 PHI_create_the_bomber_wing_desc: "Inspired by European doctrines of strategic destruction and land-air integration, the Army Air Corps has authorised the creation of a programmed dedicated to training pilots to carry out bombing missions in order to target potential enemy ground or naval forces from the skies."

 PHI_guardians_of_our_precious_skies: "Guardians of our Precious Skies"
 PHI_guardians_of_our_precious_skies_desc: "With significant modernisation and development, the Army Air Corps has grown significantly and has now become the Philippine Air Force - a separate branch from the Army. As the guardians of our precious skies, they will be our skies' vanguard in protecting our island from above."

 PHI_convene_the_national_economic_council: "Convene the National Economic Council"
 PHI_convene_the_national_economic_council_desc: "One of the very first creations of the new Commonwealth government, the National Economic Council brings together civil servants, industrialists, financiers, and technocrats to advise the President on economic matters. They have the expertise to formulate and recommend a plan of action to address the unfolding crisis."

 PHI_import_relief_rice: "Import Relief Rice"
 PHI_import_relief_rice_desc: "For the great majority of Filipinos, whether they will be able to afford enough rice to meet their needs is an ever-present part of their daily lives. As our agriculture has shifted to the cultivation of cash crops, the production of staple crops has decreased, and in difficult times this leads to rising prices. Our government shall pay for imported rice in order to keep the price of this staple down."

 PHI_halt_immigration: "Halt Immigration"
 PHI_halt_immigration_desc: "The Chinese have long dominated commercial life in this country, and are an outsize presence in many urban trades. The people's attitude toward these foreign competitors is already poor under normal circumstances, but under conditions of depression it becomes downright hostile. For the time being, we will suspend any further immigration from mainland China. The people will support a government that looks after their own."

 PHI_cut_bureaucratic_expenses: "Cut Bureaucratic Expenses"
 PHI_cut_bureaucratic_expenses_desc: "With our revenues falling rapidly, we are going to have to reduce our expenses somewhere. The civil service is the chief employer of upwardly-mobile educated Filipinos, and has also been an easy way of doling out patronage. At this time, however, we will have to economise our departments by culling unnecessary staff and cutting wages."

 PHI_revive_the_cedula: "Revive the Cedula"
 PHI_revive_the_cedula_desc: "In the old Spanish days, the cédula, a residence tax paid by all adult natives that was in effect a head tax, was a hated symbol of oppression. In fact, the Cry of Pugad Lawin, when Katipunan members tore up their cédulas, marked the beginning of the revolution. Nowadays, the necessities of the modern state demand greater tax revenues. All adults will be required to pay their municipalities a tax of fifty centavos for which they will receive a residence certificate."

 PHI_form_the_nepa: "The National Economic Protection Association"
 PHI_form_the_nepa_desc: "It is a scandal and an outrage that so much of Philippine economic life from merchants to consumer goods is kept in the hands of foreigners. The National Economic Protection Association has been formed of prominent businessmen and civic leaders, and will lead a campaign to urge the people to \"buy Filipino\"."

 PHI_key_to_economic_nationalism: "Key to Economic Nationalism"
 PHI_key_to_economic_nationalism_desc: "For decades, the leaders of the Philippines have talked of nationalism and our national aspirations. We have worked towards independence and the development of political institutions, but there is more to nationalism than this. To become a truly independent nation, we must assert control over our domestic trade and commerce, and build up indigenous Philippine wealth."

 ### Agriculture ###
 PHI_improve_internal_transport: "Improve Internal Transport"
 PHI_improve_internal_transport_desc: "In a developing agricultural economy such as ours, high transport costs are among the biggest hurdles towards economic development. There are roads that need improving, railroads that need expanding, rivers that need dredging, and wharves that need building. Improving our transportation network, whether by land or water, will allow our farmers to more quickly and efficiently get their goods to market."

 PHI_encourage_crop_diversification: "Encourage Crop Diversification"
 PHI_encourage_crop_diversification_desc: "As the Philippines has integrated into the world economy, it has become increasingly dependent on a limited number of cash crops. This has both upsides and downsides. Monocultures are more susceptible to crop failure and disease, and dependence on a single product hurts farmers when prices fall. Encouraging crop diversification will enrich our soil and provide farmers with a more varied source of income."

 PHI_redistribute_large_estates: "Redistribute Large Estates"
 PHI_redistribute_large_estates_desc: "Since time immemorial, ownership of the land has been concentrated in the hands of the elite. The Americans put in some effort to break up the friars' estates, but did not go far beyond that. The government will purchase land from their owners at fair price, divide it into parcels, and distribute it to the landless with the aim of increasing the population of small holders."

 PHI_internal_colonisation_of_Mindanao: "Internal Colonisation of Mindanao"
 PHI_internal_colonisation_of_Mindanao_desc: "Mindanao has always been a frontier, inhabited by rebellious Muslims and pagans that the Spanish never were able to tame. But the legacy of the American empire has finally quelled these peoples, and the modern Philippine state finally has the power to open up this great land. Already, thousands of citizens from Visayas have travelled to Mindanao to claim plots of land and turn unproductive wilderness into the Philippines' future breadbasket."

 PHI_cap_rents_for_sharecroppers: "Cap Rents for Sharecroppers"
 PHI_cap_rents_for_sharecroppers_desc: "The peasantry has always been bound to the landlords through debt, but in recent years the situation has been growing worse. The modernisation of the rural economy has deepened the indebtedness of tenants to the point that they cannot even afford a week's worth of rice for their family. The peasants do not ask for much, and will be largely satisfied if we limit how much landlords can demand of them and encourage debt forgiveness in tough times."

 PHI_import_farming_machinery: "Import Farming Machinery"
 PHI_import_farming_machinery_desc: "Time was that a man, a plow, and a carabao was all that was needed to run a farm. And that may be enough for the small farmers, but the large landholders know about the revolution in agriculture that is taking place in industrialised countries: automotive tractors, mechanical huskers, and other ingenious devices. If Philippine agriculture is to remain competitive in this changing world, it will need to replace man-power with machine-power."

 PHI_expand_the_sugar_centrals: "Expand the Sugar Centrals"
 PHI_expand_the_sugar_centrals_desc: "Sugarcane is cultivated on many estates scattered throughout the islands, but refining sugar is an intensive and expensive process, especially with the new centrifugal method. That is why the trend has been towards sugar growers joining together to fund large centralised sugar centrals for the processing of the crop. If we want to continue to expand production of our number one export, we must encourage the continuation of this trend."

 PHI_agricultural_and_industrial_bank: "Agricultural and Industrial Bank"
 PHI_agricultural_and_industrial_bank_desc: "Our farmers know well the obstacles facing our agricultural sector, and also know of many possible solutions, but what is missing is the means. Nothing can be done without capital, and in an undeveloped, colonial economy like the Philippines', capital is in short supply. An Agricultural and Industrial Bank shall be chartered by the government for the express purpose of giving loans to large farming enterprises."

 ### Industry ###
 PHI_domestic_textile_production: "Domestic Textile Production"
 PHI_domestic_textile_production_desc: "By far the most critical manufactured good for the average Filipino is textiles. The importation of cheap mass-produced fabrics from abroad has long since driven the old cottage industry weavers to virtual extinction. However, the creation of a domestic textile industry is the kind of light industry that lies within our capabilities. A government-owned textile factory will be opened, making us less reliant on imports for our clothing needs."

 PHI_build_fertilizer_plants: "Build Fertilizer Plants"
 PHI_build_fertilizer_plants_desc: "If we are to begin the development of a chemical industry, it only makes sense to start with products for agricultural application. Ammonium sulphate is the cheapest and easiest nitrogen fertilizer to produce. It may be less potent than most fertilizers, but its application would still yield considerable results for our farms' productivity."

 PHI_encourage_native_retailers: "Encourage Native Retailers"
 PHI_encourage_native_retailers_desc: "Philippine commerce, from the large warehouses of Manila to the little shops in every barangay, is dominated by the Chinese. There is no reason why native Filipinos should not be able to break this monopoly and become shopkeepers themselves. If we open lines of credit to those citizens who are interested in starting retail enterprises, they will be able to more easily compete with these foreigners."

 PHI_expand_the_electrical_grid: "Expand the Electrical Grid"
 PHI_expand_the_electrical_grid_desc: "The Manila Electric Company has been one of the chief drivers of the modernisation of the capital city, providing electrical power for transportation, telecommunications, and domestic use. If the country is expected to become truly modern, electricity must reach as many people as possible. The electrical grid will reach beyond Manila into the Luzon hinterlands, and others will be constructed in the outlying islands."

 PHI_protect_small_industries: "Protect Small Industries"
 PHI_protect_small_industries_desc: "In the struggle to substitute imports, it is not only the big enterprises that count. Hundreds of small factories and workshops that pursue things from spinning cotton to making soap to canning food are likewise key to the development of our domestic manufacturing. We will pass laws to protect these small businesses, both for the products they provide and also for the employment opportunities."

 PHI_la_union_cement_plant: "The La Union Cement Plant"
 PHI_la_union_cement_plant_desc: "Construction of modern buildings, roads, and port facilities relies on modern materials, chief among them cement. The National Development Company has already been successful in its creation of a cement plant on the Cebu waterfront through its subsidiary, and this model can be repeated in other regions. Northern Luzon will be the next area of our construction focus."

 PHI_national_trading_corporation: "National Trading Corporation"
 PHI_national_trading_corporation_desc: "As world tension grows, the world economy is buffeted. The great power blocs, under the strain of economic depression and fearful of one another, wall themselves off and the free flow of goods is restricted. For the security of the Philippines, it is necessary that the government can assure the procurement and stockpiling of certain critical goods and resources. A public corporation will be created with the aim of carrying this out."

 PHI_establish_the_bangko_sentral_ng_pilipinas: "Establish the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas"
 PHI_establish_the_bangko_sentral_ng_pilipinas_desc: "In 1916, the Philippine National Bank was established under a majority-public ownership. Though initially hailed as a success, it almost went insolvent during the post-war slump. But now with the peso unhooked from the United States dollar, the need for currency stability has resurrected the idea of establishing a true central bank. A Central Bank Council has already been convened to prepare the charter."

 ### Mining ###
 PHI_expand_zamboanga_plantations: "Expand Zamboanga Plantations"
 PHI_expand_zamboanga_plantations_desc: "The Zamboanga Peninsula is the most developed part of Mindanao, and already cultivates a small amount of rubber trees. There really is no reason why we should not be able to expand production of this crop to compete with the plantations in Malaya, especially when the climate and soil conditions are practically the same. Experts believe that the demand for this critical resource is bound to grow."

 PHI_exploit_zambales_chromium: "Exploit Zambales Chromium"
 PHI_exploit_zambales_chromium_desc: "The recent development of electroplating has considerably widened the application of chromium in the metallurgical industry, and the Philippines just so happens to have some of the largest untapped reserves. The United States has up to this point been its primary consumer, but as our economy becomes less tethered to America, we will be able to sell this resource freely on the world market."

 PHI_small_scale_gold_mining: "Encourage Small Scale Gold Mining"
 PHI_small_scale_gold_mining_desc: "Gold mining has long been an important activity in the Philippines stretching back all the way to pre-colonial times. In a world where many countries are still on the gold standard, the demand for gold has never been greater. Most of our gold is excavated by small-scale miners using relatively primitive technology. It may be hard and unhealthy work, but it provides them with a decent living, and should therefore not be threatened."

 PHI_roads_in_the_cordillera: "Roads in the Cordillera"
 PHI_roads_in_the_cordillera_desc: "Despite containing a great deal of wealth in the form of untapped minerals and high-quality tropical timber, the Cordillera of Luzon is the most underdeveloped part of the country, inhabited by near-uncontacted tribes still practising folk religions. The Americans had already started opening up this region with the construction of the Baguio road; we can finish what they began."

 PHI_develop_domestic_coalfields: "Develop Domestic Coalfields"
 PHI_develop_domestic_coalfields_desc: "No mineral resource is as widely useful as coal in the generation of electrical power, in domestic heating, in transport, and in industry. The National Coal Corporation has been working to make the Philippines self-sufficient in supplying its needs. Greater investments in the Sibuguey and Compostela coalfields will bring us closer to this goal."

 PHI_surigao_iron_deposits: "Surigao Iron Deposits"
 PHI_surigao_iron_deposits_desc: "The development of a native heavy industry is tempting, but for now it will have to stay a distant dream. That does not mean, of course, that our iron reserves should sit idle. There are many markets in the Pacific that would be interested in acquiring our iron for their industry, and we must ensure our mining operations have the capital to produce at competitive prices."

 PHI_electrify_the_manila_railroad: "Electrify the Manila Railroad"
 PHI_electrify_the_manila_railroad_desc: "The Manila Railroad Company has been one of the most successful enterprises of the industrial era. It has grown to over one thousand kilometres of track, connecting Manila to San Fernando in the north and Legaspi in the south, greatly improving the transport of people and cargo. Now is the time to take the next step and improve efficiency by electrifying the existing tracks."

 PHI_copper_capital_of_the_east: "Copper Capital of the East"
 PHI_copper_capital_of_the_east_desc: "Copper is a much rarer metal than most seem to realise, yet it is indispensable for the production of electrical wire and other important commodities. With the largest proven copper deposits in the Pacific region, we have already made a brisk business in exporting copper ore to various countries. Investment in this industry must be increased so that our advantage is maintained."

 PHI_fight_for_the_philippines_decision_tt: "The Second American Civil War has forced an American retreat across the Pacific, shattering their colonial influence over the Philippines and leaving a power vacuum in the region. Sitting in a vital position in the Pacific, the race is on to secure Manila, with German and Japanese representatives scurrying to bribe politicians, cajole military officers, and influence public opinion for the Pact and Sphere. Many Filipinos are reluctant to commit their nation to a foreign sphere, but with the possibility of war looming a choice will have to be made.\n\nThe side with the greatest amount of influence by the time of the §YSeptember 1939 Philippine Elections§! will see the Philippines join their faction.

 GEA_military_coordination_with_the_philippines: "Military Coordination with the Philippines"
 GEA_military_coordination_with_the_philippines_desc: "The Pacific is a tinderbox, with lines being drawn between German and Japanese interests. The Philippine Government, above all, is desperate for security amid the collapse of the United States and steadily increasing tensions in the region. Demonstrating our ability to protect the islands is essential for swaying them to our camp."
 GEA_political_negotiations_with_the_philippines: "Political Negotiations with the Philippines"
 GEA_political_negotiations_with_the_philippines_desc: "Good old fashioned diplomacy goes a long way in courting foreign nations to our side. Of course we are hardly limited to formal or even legal political channels - some backroom deals, a cleverly placed bribe, and the occasional blackmail may tip the scales in our favour."
 GEA_sabotage_japanese_influence: "Sabotage Japanese Influence"
 GEA_sabotage_japanese_influence_desc: "In the end, sometimes the right course of action is to forgo the greater victory in favour of the more realistic one. With our rival's influence steadily outpacing our own, it may be better to choose the lesser of two evils and take them down with us - with the hope that a neutral Philippines is better for us than an enemy one."
 GEA_encourage_an_open_door_in_the_philippines: "Encourage an Open Door in the Philippines"
 GEA_encourage_an_open_door_in_the_philippines_desc: "Within the Manila administration and the general public at large, there is great consternation about foreign interference in their newly \"independent\" nation. It is essential for us to pry open the door to foreign influence, even if it means our rivals may gain an advantage over us in the short term."
 GEA_economic_aid_package_to_the_philippines: "Economic Aid Package to the Philippines"
 GEA_economic_aid_package_to_the_philippines_desc: "The Philippine islands are in great need of foreign investment in order to lift their people out of the dredges of the Great Depression and Black Monday. An emergency aid package, while costly, will do them far more good than it will cost us - and will go a long way in strengthening our influence in the region."

 PHI_negotiate_with_the_Germans: "Negotiate with the Germans"

In 1878 the Sultanate of Sulu signed an agreement with the British over the rights to the northeastern part of the island of Borneo. The British maintain it was a cession of territory, but the ambiguity of the treaty (written in Malay) has led to many in the Philippines to believe it was meant to be a lease. As the legal successors to the Sultanate of Sulu, the Philippines maintain that that territory is rightfully theirs.\n\nWhile we can cite various legal justifications for our argument, court cases and linguistic debates will not garner international recognition for our claim.

## Section 1a - Quezon's First Term (1936-1939)
 #Initial Black Monday Chain (000-019)
 philippines_political_events.001.t: "Black Monday Rocks the Philippines"
 philippines_political_events.001.d: "The Philippines is an insular country in more ways than one. Under American rule, the country has been only slowly allowed to assert its aspirations while remaining tied to the metropole for its security and economic life. At the same time, the continued rule of the Nacionalista Party has contributed to an atmosphere of stability. The country's economy remains tethered to the United States, the chief market of both exports and imports and ultimate authority of its trade policy.\n\nThe news of Black Monday did not immediately rattle Manila, as the country's economic links with the German sphere are fairly modest. But when news came that the economic crisis had spread to the United States, it became clear that it would only be a matter of time before shocks were felt in the Philippines. With an economy based in the export of cash crops such as sugar, abaca, coconut products, and tobacco, the Philippines is bound tightly to the US, and a deepening depression there will undoubtedly lead to falling trade revenues.\n\nAs a colonial subject, there is only so much the Philippine government may do to face the crisis. Still, it is not helpless. In the face of near-guaranteed falling export revenues, there are ways to make up the difference. Cutting expenditures while raising certain taxes will help keep the budget under control. At the same time, measures must be taken to ensure that the common people are not reduced to poverty and starvation."
 philippines_political_events.001.a: "We are up to the challenge."

 philippines_political_events.002.t: "The Philippine Political Scene"
 philippines_political_events.002.d: "The Nacionalista Party has been the dominant force in Philippine politics since the first elections held in 1907. Its original platform was a simple one: immediate independence from the United States. Subsequent history proved rather more complicated, as Nacionalista leaders frequently shifted positions on the terms and time-frame of independence in their negotiations with American authorities. Finally, however, a timeline for eventual full independence has been achieved, and the Nacionalistas can claim that they have fulfilled the promise of their party's name.\n\nThough the Philippines may be a liberal democracy on paper, its political culture holds much to be desired. In a country where most of the population is desperately poor and lacks much education, politics is dominated by local elites known as \"caciques\". Caciques form alliances through mutual interest and family ties, and exert their influence through the dispensing of patronage. Political success is won by those who are the best at playing this corrupt system, and no one is better at it than Nacionalista leader and current President Manuel Quezon.\n\nThat is not to say that Philippine democracy is a total sham. The opinion of the masses still matters, and when their displeasure reaches a boiling point, it can rock the ship of state. Quezon's success comes not only from his relationship with the country's elite, but from his ability to convince ordinary Filipinos that he is also a champion of the common man. Under the vague slogan of \"social justice\", Quezon has pursued a quasi-populist agenda. Though Quezon's critics may rightly say that he has been more talk than action, the limited social programs of his presidency have won Quezon considerable popularity."
 philippines_political_events.002.a: "Can Quezon really rule forever, though?"

 philippines_political_events.003.t: "Potential Challengers"
 philippines_political_events.003.d: "From his balcony at Malacañang Palace, Quezon might rightly feel secure in his position at the top of the Philippines. That is, so long as things continue along more or less the same trajectory. Quezon will have to face another election eventually, and a lot might happen in three years.\n\nIt is not clear at this point, however, who would even oppose Quezon. The most likely candidates would come from the Partido Democrata. Eternally stuck in the opposition and struggling to define itself as more than \"not-the-Nacionalistas\", the party will soon have to choose to rally behind either the idealistic Claro M. Recto, who promises to transform politics for the better, or the old revolutionary Emilio Aguinaldo, an increasingly vocal critic of the government who may use his personal popularity and nationalist credentials to make a bid for the presidency.\n\nAt the same time, syndicalist sentiment continues to grow among Philippine workers and peasants. Channelled into the radical Partido Obrero, the socialists find inspiration in the Third Internationale and dream of revolution. There is little possibility that they could ever win a presidential election, but if strong enough they could attempt to destabilise the Republic.\n\nHowever, the real threat to Quezon's power comes not from without, but from within. There is no shortage of highly ambitious figures among the Nacionalistas who may claim loyalty to the President but would eagerly snatch the crown if it were offered to them. Quezon's success and popularity have squashed any challengers for the moment, but should the President make a slip, he may find his own party revolting against him."
 philippines_political_events.003.a: "In politics, it's all about who you know."
 philippines_political_events.003.b: "The future of the Philippines rests with the people."

 philippines_political_events.004.t: "The Elites are Angry"
 philippines_political_events.004.d: "Great changes have been taking place in the Philippines. President Quezon's trumpeting of \"social justice\" has not been mere rhetoric, but has truly heralded the coming of an administration that is more focused on delivering concrete reforms to the masses. Quezon has always enjoyed basking in the affections of the people, and his personal popularity has never been higher. Reports from the provinces bring stories of peasant groups with falling attendance, as tenants counter the exhortations of agitators with the response that the President will fix it.\nKeeping the people satisfied is all well and nice, but it does not come without costs. Local elites feel their influence slipping as the lower classes look towards the central government for security and rewards. This discontent is trickling upwards to the capital as Nacionalista congressmen quietly squirm over Quezon's populist course. Though closely kept from the President himself, there is talk of a brewing party revolt to challenge Quezon in the next election. It is also rumoured that foreign powers are keeping themselves tuned in to these developments, seeing in a challenger to Quezon the opportunity to expand their influence."
 philippines_political_events.004.a: "The President decides!"
 philippines_political_events.004.b: "Don't worry, Quezon has not forgotten his most loyal benefactors."

 philippines_political_events.005.t: "The Populists are Angry"
 philippines_political_events.005.d: "One does not expect too much from democracy in the Philippines, well-known for its corruption and clientelism. Still, it is surprising how nakedly cynical Quezon's administration has been. The people laugh at talk of \"social justice\", as the lower classes remain mired in poverty. Meanwhile, government largesse trickles down to local elites, who keep the political wheels turning. The Nacionalista Party has abandoned any factionalism and stands loyally behind Quezon.\nIt may be, however, that the Nacionalistas are overconfident in their position. Having grown used to governing with no effective opposition, they may be missing its growth right under their noses. The Democrata Party under Claro Recto is attempting to tap into the discontent with unexpected success. At the same time, the old revolutionary Emilio Aguinaldo, a populist if there ever was one, is mulling a run for president in the next election. Most concerning is the growth of the radically syndicalist Partido Obrero, which thinks not in terms of elections but revolutions. It is also rumoured that foreign powers are keeping themselves tuned in to these developments, seeing in a challenger to Quezon the opportunity to expand their influence."
 philippines_political_events.005.a: "Our position is unassailable!"
 philippines_political_events.005.b: "Perhaps we should throw the masses a bone."

 #American Civil War Chain (020-039)
 philippines_political_events.020.t: "The Declaration of the Republic"
 philippines_political_events.020.d: "In a shocking turn of events, civil war has erupted in the United States of America, and their power projection in the Pacific has vanished overnight. Communications with Washington have broken down, and the American High Commissioner is at a complete loss for what to do. At 9 AM today, President Quezon, backed by his cabinet and the Philippine Congress, declared the Second Philippine Republic before a cheering crowd at Malacañang Palace.\n\nWith all the jubilation, it will take a little while for the full effects of the moment to be felt. The political dominance of Quezon and the Nacionalista Party has been inextricably linked with the Philippine struggle for independence, and now with the United States out of the picture, the landscape has changed. Most significant is a recent change to the Constitution, in which Quezon pushed through an amendment shortening the presidential term from six years to four, but giving him the option to seek another term. This means the next presidential election will be as soon as 1939, and who Quezon's opponents will be remains to be seen.\n\nRight now, the task at hand is to figure out what to do with the remaining Americans. Although they have been streaming out of the country in the last few months, many remain, including American soldiers guarding their military bases—which happen to be full of very valuable equipment. With no government to back them up, they are at the mercy of whatever decision we take."
 philippines_political_events.020.a: "These rifles and jeeps are a small price to pay for occupation."
 philippines_political_events.020.b: "Have them stand down, but leave them their property."

 #Fight for the Philippines Events (040-059)
 philippines_political_events.040.t: "The Fight for the Philippines"
 philippines_political_events.040.d.body: "Only a short time ago, the Philippines was the United States' citadel in the Western Pacific. That status quo is suddenly gone. With the withdrawal of American warships and soldiers following the eruption of the American Civil War, the Philippines has declared itself an independent republic. At the same time, it has never been in a more precarious position. The United States was the main check on the duelling designs of Japan and Germany in the region, and with it gone the two powers' rivalry has flared up once again. The Philippines lies in between Tokyo and Singapore, and its allegiance is ripe for the taking. Already, diplomatic and economic missions have sailed for Manila, hoping to curry favour with the new Asian republic."
 philippines_political_events.040.d.PHI: "$philippines_political_events.040.d.body$\n\nFor the Philippines, this situation presents both an opportunity and a risk. Aligning with a power provides benefits but will also earn the enmity of its opponent. Some incline towards Japan, with its vision of Pan-Asian cooperation and the end of Western imperialism. Others point towards Germany, still the world's hegemon and guardian of the present order. Still more advocate keeping distance from both Japan and Germany, though under present circumstances this will likely prove a challenge. Not a few quietly curse the withdrawal of the Americans, and hope against hope that the US, colonial master though it was, may someday recover its strength."
 philippines_political_events.040.d.GER: "$philippines_political_events.040.d.body$\n\nThe Philippines was never much on Germany's radar. Though there is a respectable German commercial presence in the country, the Kaiserreich was happy to recognise America's hegemony over the islands, and focused on preserving its Asian presence through cooperation with British and Dutch colonial officials while establishing relations with independent Asian states like Siam and Burma. Now that a new Asian state has arrived on the scene, we may want to continue this practice with the newly independent Filipino government. If for no other reason, we should strive to get Manila on our side before Tokyo can."
 philippines_political_events.040.d.JAP: "$philippines_political_events.040.d.body$\n\nThe Philippines have long been a thorn in Japan's side. It was the centre of American influence and military strength in the region, both of which were long considered by Tokyo as a potential threat to the growing power of the Japanese Empire as well as a disgusting display of Western imperialism. With the Americans gone, however, the situation has changed. The Philippines lay unaligned, but are already a major Japanese trade partner and hosting a sizable Japanese population. An alliance with the Philippines would greatly extend Japanese power to the south. If for no other reason, we should strive to get Manila on our side before Berlin can."
 philippines_political_events.040.d.USA: "$philippines_political_events.040.d.body$\n\nThe withdrawal from the Philippines was a sad day for the United States. Even though the relationship between the two countries was that of master and subject, there was also a genuine friendship between many Americans and Filipinos. As American forces left, they were often (privately) told by Filipino leaders that the Philippines would be open to realignment with the United States once the present civil unrest were over. With the worst of the war behind us, the opportunity of reasserting our power in the Western Pacific presents itself. But Germany and Japan have been vying for influence in Manila while we've been away, and we need to catch up- fast."

#Military aid events
 philippines_military_events.060.t: "The Germans Offer Military Aid"
 philippines_military_events.060.d: "The Philippine Army was officially established in December 1935, to be built out of veterans from the Philippine Constabulary and the Philippine Scouts with American help. These plans never fully materialised before the Second American Civil War thrust the Philippines into unknown waters, and many wonder if the new Republic is up to the task of arming and training the force necessary to defend the islands from foreign invasion.\n\nThe Germans offer to take over the role of American trainers, promising the delivery of arms and experienced military advisors needed to train an entire division along German lines. This division would then be the model for the further development of the Philippine military, greatly increasing their influence on our army's development.

 philippines_political_events.070.t: "The Philippines Entrenches its Neutrality"
 philippines_political_events.070.d: "In the end, the Philippines has managed to fend off foreign attempts to pressure them into an alliance. Like most things in international relations, this also comes with some downsides. The general public is reluctant to commit to any foreign military adventures, and the Philippines will likely seek to bunker down and attempt to remain neutral amid the sea of war. Of course, peace virtually always beats war and our neutrality comes with the added benefit of political flexibility - if war does come to our shores or the situation otherwise rouses the general public to war we may yet end up joining a faction."

Spurning overtures from Tokyo and local German authorities in Singapore, President [PHI.GetLeader], has declared his nation's neutrality in any armed conflict.\n\nIt will likely not be so easy. Manila sits in a strategic location, and while they have implicitly threatened to align against any invader, the temptation to secure their allegiance by force remains strong.

Maybe this is because they did not want to overstretch themselves, maybe this is because of their own fickle politics, maybe (we dread) this is because they have negative intentions for us in the future.

Spurning overtures from local German authorities in Singapore, President [PHI.GetLeader], fresh from his election victory, has announced his intentions to sign a series of binding military agreements with Tokyo.\n\nThis security arrangement is a tremendous victory for [JAP.GetLeader], providing the IJN vital bases in the Pacific close to the East Indies. But whether or not this will bring peace to the islands or invasion remains to be seen."

 #American Alignment (130-149)
 philippines_political_events.130.t: "Our Triumph in Manila"
 philippines_political_events.130.d: "Thanks to American pressure and promises, the Philippine government has decided to throw their lot with us in the coming conflicts in East Asia. Bilateral relations between us have been trending towards an alliance, a hard earned conclusion of intense diplomatic lobbying. It seems only logical that we stand together against foreign threats, though perhaps it would be better to simply push them towards formal neutrality, denying our rivals ground."

 philippines_political_events.131.d: "To many's surprise, the Americans managed to not only end their civil war in a timely manner but also rebuild their influence in the Pacific. The Philippines, under pressure and perhaps taking into account old bonds between them, have agreed to sign a treaty of mutual defence in hopes of counterbalancing German and Japanese threats. The President, in an announcement today, has declared our willingness to remain open to possibly entering further alliances."
 philippines_political_events.131.a: "Washington returns as our protector."

 philippines_political_events.132.t: "The Philippines Realigns with America"
 philippines_political_events.132.d: "Having achieved its independence from the United States, the young Philippine Republic has been courted by all sides as tensions rise in the Pacific. Few would have thought that the Americans, divided by civil war, would ever be in a position to return to influence in Manila. Yet in the end, President [PHI.GetLeader] and the Philippine government have decided to choose the devil they know, agreeing to treaties of mutual defence and resuming high level Philippine-American relations.\n\nThis security arrangement is aimed to protect the islands from German and Japanese encroachment, but there is no going back to the 1920s status quo. Whether or not this treaty can truly protect the Philippines from war remains to be seen."

 # 1939 Elections Events (150-199)
 philippines_political_events.150.t: "The 1939 Campaign Season Begins"
 philippines_political_events.150.d: "It's a presidential election year; in September, the voters of the Philippines will be headed to the polls to determine who will be the country's next leader. Already one candidate has thrown his hat in the ring: incumbent president Manuel Quezon. This comes as no surprise, as Quezon specifically sought the passage of a constitutional amendment several years ago to change his single six-year term to potentially two four-year terms. As the leader of the Nacionalista Party and most powerful man in the country, Quezon believes he can still cruise to re-election.\n\nIn this first-past-the-post national election, there can be only one viable challenger if the opposition wants any chance of success. The Democrata Party seems poised to nominate Claro M. Recto if it senses that the field is clear. However, Recto may hang back if it turns out that the old revolutionary Emilio Aguinaldo declares his own candidacy, as many of his confidantes are indicating. Rumours even have it that sections of the Nacionalista Party dissatisfied with Quezon are poised to split the party and back Manuel Roxas, though nothing has come of this yet. The syndicalist Partido Obrero has already declared that it will be boycotting the election, and is planning large anti-government demonstrations as the date nears."
 philippines_political_events.150.a: "Order and expertise will deliver results!"

 philippines_political_events.150.c: "As one nation we will protect our independence."

 philippines_political_events.151.t: "The 1939 Philippine Elections Approaches"
 philippines_political_events.151.d: "It's a presidential election year; in September, the voters of the Philippines will be headed to the polls to determine who will be the country's next leader. Already one candidate has thrown his hat in the ring: incumbent president Manuel Quezon. Both Germany and Japan have attempted to cultivate close relationships with the President, but although he has given neither the cold shoulder, it is still uncertain which way he truly inclines. Perhaps it is for this reason that German and Japanese efforts have gotten deeper into the Nacionalista Party itself, where they might find an a more willing collaborator.\n\nIn this first-past-the-post national election, there can be only one viable challenger if the opposition wants any chance of success. Potential Democrata Party candidate Claro M. Recto has been spotted with German businessmen, who are believed to be bankrolling the party. Meanwhile, potential presidential contender Emilio Aguinaldo has just returned from a trip to Japan; there is little doubt as to where his friends lie. The syndicalist Partido Obrero has denounced the influence of foreign capitalists on the national election, and is planning large anti-government demonstrations as the date nears."
 philippines_political_events.151.a: "We must step up our efforts!"
 philippines_political_events.151.b: "Noted."

## Section 1b - Quezon's Second Term (1939-1943+)
 philippines_political_events.200.t: "President Quezon Cruises to Re-election"
 philippines_political_events.200.d: "The results are in: Manuel Quezon has secured re-election as President of the Philippine Republic. For months, people wondered whether Quezon's decade-long streak of uninterrupted political wins would finally come to an end, and it seems that they were foolish to do so. Once again, Quezon has proven himself a political master, effortlessly riding the currents of popular opinion while keeping intact the entrenched political establishment. Today, Quezon once again recited his oath of office from the balcony of Malacañang Palace as crowds cheered below."
 philippines_political_events.200.a: "Congratulations to President Quezon!"

 philippines_political_events.201.t: "The 1943 Presidential Elections"
 philippines_political_events.201.d: "This day was always bound to come. Though Quezon may have wished to go on as president (and rumours have it that he inquired with members of the Supreme Court to see if he could), term limits and declining health have finally compelled him to step down from the presidency. In his place, Vice President Sergio Osmeña stepped in as the Nacionalista candidate. Osmeña has long languished in Quezon's shadow, as equal parts friend and rival, but he has finally received the chance to take the reins himself. Easily cruising to re-election over token opposition, Osmeña's victory cements the Nacionalista's continued dominance of Philippine politics."
 philippines_political_events.201.a: "Congratulations to President Osmeña!"

## Section 1c - Roxas' Presidency (1939-1943+)
 philippines_political_events.300.t: "Roxas and the Elite reassert Control"
 philippines_political_events.300.d: "Quezon dug his own grave. Having become carried away by his self-image as father of the masses, he neglected to shore up his position in the Nacionalista Party. As a result, a large section of the party bucked and nominated Manuel Roxas for president. The caciques went into overdrive, using all of their influence to cajole, buy, and bully the people into voting against Quezon. When the results finally came in, it was clear their efforts had paid off: Roxas had won.\n\nToday, Roxas recited his oath of office from the balcony of Malacañang Palace as crowds cheered below. In his first speech as president, he announced a new course that would correct the errors of recent years and return the Nacionalista Party to its roots as the guarantors of sound, stable government. He indicated that would-be revolutionaries and malcontents would be dealt with harshly. In his final remarks, Roxas also indicated a willingness for the Philippines to cooperate with foreign partners."
 philippines_political_events.300.a: "Congratulations to President Roxas!"

## Section 1d - Aguinaldo's Presidency (1939-1943+)
 philippines_political_events.400.t: "Aguinaldo Upsets the Establishment"
 philippines_political_events.400.d: "Quezon dug his own grave. Having become too comfortable with his own position at the height of power, he failed to register the discontent that was bubbling below. As a result, the people finally bucked the Nacionalistas and flocked before the great hero Emilio Aguinaldo. The caciques went into overdrive, using all of their influence to try and cajole, buy, and bully the people into voting for Quezon, but it was not enough. When the results finally came in, it was clear the impossible happened: Aguinaldo had won.\n\nToday, Aguinaldo recited his oath of office from the balcony of Malacañang Palace as crowds cheered below. In his first speech as president, he announced a recovery of the spirit that had guided the country in its war for independence. The era of corrupt and divisive politics was drawing to an end, as the entire people rallied to the cause of the nation. In his final remarks, Aguinaldo announced his intention to make the Philippines work with Japan \"for a glorious Asian future\"."
 philippines_political_events.400.a: "Congratulations to President Aguinaldo!"

## Section 1e - Recto's Presidency (1939-1943+)
 philippines_political_events.500.t: "Recto Rallies Populist Forces"
 philippines_political_events.500.d: "Quezon dug his own grave. Having become too comfortable with his own position at the height of power, he failed to register the discontent that was bubbling below. As a result, the people finally bucked the Nacionalistas and gave their support to the Democrata candidate Claro Recto. The caciques went into overdrive, using all of their influence to try and cajole, buy, and bully the people into voting for Quezon, but the Democratas beat them to the punch. When the results finally came in, it was clear the impossible happened: Recto had won.\n\nToday, Recto recited his oath of office from the balcony of Malacañang Palace as crowds cheered below. In his first speech as president, he congratulated the Philippines for seeing its first ever peaceful transfer of power to a different political party. He underlined his administration's intentions to clean up corruption, protect civil liberties, and to above all serve the people. In his final remarks, Recto praised Germany as a \"protector of the rights and interests of small nations\"."
 philippines_political_events.500.a: "Congratulations to President Recto!"

## Section 1f - Evangelista's Presidency (1939-1943+)
 philippines_political_events.600.t: "Evangelista Leads a Socialist Revolution"
 philippines_political_events.600.d: "The election was Quezon's undoing. Though his popularity was in the pits, having completely lost the people's trust, he stubbornly attempted to hold onto power. With the opposition bickering and unable to coalesce behind a candidate, it seemed that the democratic process was failing. The Partido Obrero grew in Manila, proclaiming that the capitalist regime was nearing its end. When a peasant revolt broke out in Luzon, the constabulary melted away, and soon armed peasants were marching towards the capital. With the city paralysed by a general strike, the cowardly politicians fled, and the red flag was raised over Intramuros.\n\nFrom the balcony of Malacañang Palace, Partido Obrero leader Crisanto Evangelista proclaimed the birth of the Socialist Republic of the Philippines. He announced that a provisional executive had already been formed with himself at the head, which would begin the task of constituting a true workers' and peasants' government. Below, throngs of working class Filipinos cheered and sang the Internationale in a choir of dozens of languages"

 philippines_military_events.001.t: "Procuring Army Equipment"
 philippines_military_events.001.d: "With our army swelling in size and our traditional protector in retreat, our supply chain races to keep up. This is no easy task, especially as the bulk of arms development and production are concentrated in the hands of mutually distrustful Great Powers that threaten to plunge the world once more into war. After reaching out to different suppliers, we have received several promising offers of technical support in modernising our military, whether it be improving our rifles or artillery or our support network.\n\nSome in the high command have suggested a much more ambitious proposal - ensuring the long term security of our nation by developing an extensive procurement pipeline integrating multiple suppliers, maintenance and repair hubs, and sometimes creating new ones from scratch. It will be pricey, but so is freedom."
 philippines_military_events.001.a: "Procure German Support Equipment."
 philippines_military_events.001.b: "Acquire Japanese Infantry Equipment."
 philippines_military_events.001.c: "Purchase American Artillery."
 philippines_military_events.001.e: "We will build an arms network from the ground up!"

 philippines_military_events.020.t: "Importing Naval Designs"
 philippines_military_events.020.d: "For an island nation such as our own, controlling the waters around us is vital for our security- doubly so when the great powers competing for influence in the region have a massive head start laying down armadas we can never hope to match. Still, something is better than nothing, and our fledgling fleet could use a head start. We have received offers from various suppliers, each jockeying for influence in our developing navy. With naval warfare rapidly changing, embracing new technology is key to even the odds laid out against us.\n\nA more ambitious proposal from leading figures in our new navy and an alliance of shipyards has made a case for extensive investment by our government to jump start domestic naval shipbuilding. Allocating these funds would consume not only the money set aside for importing foreign naval designs, it would also require us to pull from deep within our coffers."
 philippines_military_events.020.a: "Build German U-Boats."
 philippines_military_events.020.b: "Acquire designs for Japanese Torpedo Bombers."
 philippines_military_events.020.c: "Purchase plans for American Destroyers."
 philippines_military_events.020.e: "We must be able to create ships of our very own!"

 philippines_military_events.040.t: "Seek Air Expertise"
 philippines_military_events.040.d: "The war in the air is a rapidly developing frontier in military development, and one we can ill afford to fall behind in. Controlling the skies and using it to rain down bullets, bombs, and torpedoes on invading forces might mean the difference between victory in defeat. Foreign suppliers have generously offered to aid us in developing and integrating some of these new aerial technologies, though we must never forget the basics either. Sometimes dubbed the \"Knights\" of the new age, a new generation of Philippine heroes eagerly line up to take their place defending the world above us."
 philippines_military_events.040.a: "Buy German Dive-Bombers."
 philippines_military_events.040.b: "Purchase Japanese Zero Fighters."
 philippines_military_events.040.c: "Rely on American Pilot Training."

 PHI_KR_gathering_storm_desc: "The brief freedom the Philippines experienced under the First Philippine Republic was brutally quashed when the 1898 Treaty of Paris formally recognised the USA's annexation of the island archipelago. The Philippines became governed by the American-run \"Insular Government,\" which slowly began to delegate authority to Philippine politicians and prepare them for the possibility of independence. Manuel Quezon and his Nacionalista Party, despite their calls for immediate independence, have proven to be pragmatic partners of the American administration. But with the US hurtling towards conflict, independence may come sooner than expected..."

### Intro Screen ###
 PHI_country_intro_background: "GFX_PHI_intro"
 PHI_country_intro_header: "A Path Towards Independence"
 PHI_country_intro_content: "After centuries of Spanish rule, the Philippines entered open revolt in 1896, led by the revolutionary secret society Katipunan. A year later, the revolutionaries declared modern Asia's first republic. Success was not to last, as the Spanish counteroffensive forced the revolutionary government to flee. The Spanish-American War destroyed Spanish power in the Philippines, but it soon became clear that the United States were not going to allow an independent Philippine state to exist either. Thus began the Philippine-American War, which quickly devolved into guerrilla warfare as the Americans extended their control over the country. By 1902, the war was officially declared over as the major nationalist forces were defeated, and the Philippines became a US territory.\n\nThe national struggle transitioned from military to political. The Philippine Organic Act of 1902 had provided the insular government with an elected assembly, and the first elections were held in 1907. They were won overwhelmingly by the Nacionalista Party of Manuel Quezon and Sergio Osmeña, which called for \"immediate and unconditional independence\". Self-government was further strengthened by the Jones Act of 1916, which replaced the unelected Philippine Commission with the Senate. After years of lobbying and campaigning, Filipino representatives finally compelled the US Congress to pass the Tydings-McDuffie Act, which transformed the territory into the Commonwealth of the Philippines, established complete self-government in domestic matters, and set a date for full Philippine independence ten years in the future.\n\nThe first presidential election was handily won by a Manuel Quezon and Sergio Osmeña who became president and vice president respectively. The Nacionalista Party has controlled the legislature for its entire existence and currently holds an unassailable dominance over the political life of the country. The main opposition, the Democrata Party, has struggled to threaten the Nacionalistas' position. Since the Philippines is now under a presidential system of governance, the Democratas or another potential opposition movement will have to wait for the next presidential election to have a chance at power. For now, Quezon and the Nacionalistas are able to pursue their efforts at nation-building while keeping down peasant unrest and the embryonic syndicalist movement. All this stability is, of course, guaranteed by the United States' continued control over the country's defence and foreign policy."
