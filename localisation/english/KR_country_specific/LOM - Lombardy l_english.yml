We must have an emergency meeting of local leaders and higher-ups to decide how our country will be ran."

 LOM_land_reform_desc: "From the Weltkrieg to the Civil War to the collapse of the Republic, we have have seen our fair share of turmoil and war.

We must begin land reform processes to ensure our people have enough to eat."
 LOM_agricultural_subsidies: "Agricultural Subsidies"
 LOM_agricultural_subsidies_desc: "Although our initial land reform efforts have been successful, it will still take time before farmers are fully accustomed to the new practises.

 LOM_strengthen_duke_desc: "Lombardia's righteous Duke is like a father to the people. Like any good father, he must at times be firm with his children and guide their development. If justice and good governance are to ever be assured, the Duke must be the ultimate authority in Lombadia."

 LOM_denounce_ambrosia_desc: "With the restoration of Lombardia, many Lombard Republicans, undeterred by the failure of their beloved Italian Republic, embraced the legacy of old Ambrosia, a uniquely Lombard strain of Republicanism.

 LOM_return_crown: "Request Return of the Lombard Crown"
 LOM_return_crown_desc: "The Iron Crown of Lombardy, inlaid with a Nail of the True Cross, was the centrepiece of the coronation of the old Frankish kings of Italy and later rested upon the heads of Holy Roman Emperors.

 LOM_crown_king: "Crown the King of the Lombards"
 LOM_crown_king_desc: "With the Iron Crown of Lombardy in our possession and our nation firmly established, the good Duke no longer need be sullied by a title unworthy of a man of such virtue. For his sake and our people's, let us proclaim the Kingdom of [ITA.GetNonIdeologyName]."

 LOM_question_of_radicals_desc: "Within our nation there are certain circles that aim for a more... radical form of governance, the largest of them being the Lega Longobarda.

 LOM_republic_constitution: "The Republican Constitution"

 LOM_work_with_nobility: "A Republican Nobility"
 LOM_work_with_nobility_desc: "The aristocracy remains a powerful force in Lombardia, and we cannot entertain the idea of driving them out. We should establish a House of Lords similar to the one in the former United Kingdom to ensure noble voices are heard."

 LOM_encourage_nationalism: "Encourage Lombard Nationalism"

 LOM_forts: "Stengthen the Border"
 LOM_forts_desc: "The syndicalists to the south pose a grave danger to the existence of Lombardy, vastly outnumbering us both in population and industry. If Lombardy is to survive the upcoming war, we must invest into an extensive line of forts along the Po River."

 LOM_grand_battle_plan: "Outsmart the Enemy"

 lombardy.1.d.sic: "The Iron Crown of Lombardy, which sat upon the heads of Holy Roman Emperors for centuries, was taken by Austria in the Weltkrieg. Following Austria's recent collapse, an agent of the Bourbon kingdom in the south spirited it away to Naples. While we are unable to force the Bourbons to return it, they may be amicable should we request the crown's return."
 lombardy.1.d.vienna: "The Iron Crown of Lombardy, which sat upon the heads of Holy Roman Emperors for centuries, was taken by Austria in the Weltkrieg. With Austria under occupation, perhaps the occupiers will return in to us."

 lombardy.7.t: "Lombardia Is Hiring Retired Prussian Generals"
 lombardy.7.d: "Lombardia has been hiring a large number of retired Generals from the Weltkrieg to provide their undisciplined troops with proper Prussian drills.

 lombardy.15.c: "... the Partito Popolare Lombardo!"
 lombardy.15.e: "... the Lega Longobarda!"

 lombardy.20.t: "The Question of Radicals"
 lombardy.20.d: "Within our nation there are certain circles that aim for a more... radical form of governance, the largest of them being the Lega Longobarda. It was the rise of groups similar to these that lead to the downfall of the Republic of Italy, and if we want to avoid a similar fate we must grapple with the question of if we should ban these radical groups to protect our young democracy, or if we must let them grow in the name of free speech and liberty."
 lombardy.20.a: "We must defend democracy at all costs!"
 lombardy.20.b: "We stand for freedom above all else!"

 lombardy.21.t: "Lombardia's Future"
 lombardy.21.d: "The government of Lombardia is currently in the hands of the military, which supports Duke Marcello Visconti... but the duke has expressed reservations about taking full control of the country. Despite the protests of some who say republicanism failed Italy, the duke maintains that the time for monarchies in Italy has also passed. Still, there are many in the country who support him and suggest his guidance is what the people want."
 lombardy.21.a: "Republicanism cannot be trusted!"
 lombardy.21.b: "The Duke must step down!"

 lombardy.22.t: "Lombardia's Future"
 lombardy.22.d: "Lombardia is in a state of turmoil, and the people currently have a great distrust of republicanism. Many are openly expressing a preference for Marcello Visconti, the Count of Milan, to take his place as the ruler of Lombardia - and he certainly has the military's support. He also does not seem like a man who much wants to rule, so it seems likely he would turn the country over to elections anyhow... but can we trust that? Should we not pursue republicanism, so long as it is in our grasp?"
 lombardy.22.a: "We must turn to the Count for help!"
 lombardy.22.b: "No, we cannot turn back to the monarchy!"
