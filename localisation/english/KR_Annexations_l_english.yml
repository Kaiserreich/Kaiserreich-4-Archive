### Events and Decisions ###
 annexation_decisions:0 "Annexation Decisions"
 annexation_decisions_desc:0 "Having gained control of new swaths of land we must now work out what to do with it. Occupation can be expensive and destabilising but it would give us direct access to the riches of this new land. On the other hand, creating a puppet nation would certainly be cheaper, though our new subjects may not be as reliable as we might think. Either way, the fate of nations rests in our hands."

 annex.occupation:0 "Military occupation is the only answer."
 annex.integration:0 "Assimilate into [Root.GetAdjective] territory"

 annex.15.t:0 "An Old Idea Made New"
 annex.15.d:0 "In 1848 the Frankfurt Assembly debated the fate of the German states. In 1871 Bismarck forged a united Germany. In 1919 we smashed the Entente. And now we have finally achieved the dream of a unified state for the German people. While we have met much resistance in Austria, in time they will see that no one can stand against us; Germany will stand united and strong."
 annex.15.a:0 "Long live Großdeutschland!"

 annex.18.t:0 "Territories Regained!"
 annex.18.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has elected to return lands in formerly Austrian-occupied Italy to us."

 annex.38.a:0 "Hurrah!"

 annex.74.t:0 "A New King in Madrid?"
 annex.74.d:0 "Some in Berlin are debating whether or not to select a new Spanish king. We could restore the legal government of the House of Bourbon or enthrone the pretenders of the House of Bourbon-Parma. What decision is made?"
 annex.74.a:0 "Prince Frederick of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen will be the new king."
 annex.74.b:0 "Restore the House of Bourbon under Jaime I."
 annex.74.c:0 "Support the Carlist pretender, Javier of Bourbon-Parma."
 annex.74.e:0 "Actually, we'd rather not meddle in their internal affairs."

 annex.81.t:0 "The Fate of Bavaria"
 annex.81.d:0 "The Kingdom of Bavaria and the mantle of Germany itself are ours. We can finally implement an old Habsburg dream of integrating the area into our nation!"
 annex.81.a:0 "Great!"

 annex.82.t:0 "Integration of Bavaria"
 annex.82.d:0 "The Kingdom of Bavaria, which we once unsuccessfully tried to add to our Empire in the 18th century, have been integrated fully into the new Habsburg-led Germany."

 annex.83.t:0 "The Fates of Baden and Württemberg"
 annex.83.d:0 "The Grand Duchy of Baden, the Kingdom of Württemberg and the mantle of Germany itself are ours. We can finally implement an old Habsburg dream of integrating the area into our nation!"

 annex.84.t:0 "Integration of Baden and Württemberg"
 annex.84.d:0 "The Grand Duchy of Baden and the Kingdom of Württemberg have been integrated fully into the new Habsburg-led Germany."

 annex.90.t:0 "German Switzerland Under Our Control"
 annex.90.d:0 "The peoples of the German-speaking cantons of old Switzerland have finally folded to our control."
 annex.90.a:0 "Great!"

 annex.92.t:0 "The Partition of Switzerland"
 annex.92.d:0 "The German Empire, currently occupying Switzerland, has proposed a partition of the old Confederation with us. They have offered us the Italian-speaking former cantons of Ticino and Graubünden, centred in the town of Lugano."
 annex.92.a:0 "An excellent proposition!"
 annex.92.b:0 "We don't trust the Germans."

 annex.93.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Accepts"
 annex.93.d:0 "The Italians have accepted our offer for the partition of Switzerland. We will now transfer sovereignty of the Italian-speaking cantons of Ticino and Graubünden to them."
 annex.93.a:0 "Great!"

 annex.94.t:0 "Italian Switzerland Under our Control"
 annex.94.d:0 "The peoples of the Italian-speaking cantons of old Switzerland have finally folded to our control."
 annex.94.a:0 "Great!"

 annex.95.t:0 "Italy Refuses"
 annex.95.d:0 "To our great surprise the Italians have refused our generous partition offer, citing various reasons and claims. The military occupation of the region will continue."
 annex.95.a:0 "Their loss..."

 annex.96.d:0 "The German Empire, currently occupying the former country of Switzerland, has proposed a partition of the old Confederation with us. They have offered us the former French-speaking cantons centred in the city of Geneva."

 annex.97.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Accepts"
 annex.97.d:0 "The French have accepted our offer for the partition of Switzerland. We will now transfer sovereignty of the French-speaking cantons to them."

 annex.98.t:0 "French Switzerland Under Our Control"

 annex.99.t:0 "France Refuses"
 annex.99.d:0 "To our great surprise, the French have refused our generous partition offer, citing various reasons and claims. It appears that military occupation of the region must continue."

 annex.184.t:0 "An O'Neill Restoration?"
 annex.184.d:0 "Now that we have recreated an Irish state some have proposed the restoration of an Irish monarchy. The most obvious option would be the O'Neills, descendants of the last High King of Ireland, Brian O'Neill, and who played a major part in both the Nine Years War and the Irish Confederate Wars with Hugh O'Neill and Owen Roe O'Neill achieving many great victories against the English and Scots. The current head of the Clanaboy line of the O'Neill dynasty Jorge Maria O'Neill resides in Portugal, currently working as an electrical engineer, a role far beneath his station."
 annex.184.a:0 "The O'Neill's shall be restored to the throne of Ireland!"
 annex.184.b:0 "Maintain an Irish republic."

 annex.185.t:0 "Jorge O'Neill arrives!"
 annex.185.d:0 "Jorge Maria O'Neill has agreed to take up residence in Dublin Castle as High King of Ireland. Arriving this morning, he made a speech on the Hill of Tara affirming that he would be a strong and just ruler, and emphasised the achievements and victories of Hugh O'Neill and Owen Roe O'Neill over the English. While die-hard republicans are angry over the restoration, many have accepted the new High King as Ireland's rightful head of state."
 annex.185.a:0 "O'Neill Abú!"

 annex.240.t:0 "The Fate of the Former Papal States"
 annex.240.d:0 "Our recent annexation of Northern Italy has left us with remnants of land that, according to the peace treaty of 1919, should pertain to the Pope. We thus have the option of returning it to its rightful owner, either freely or conditioned to their submission. We could also simply continue the occupation of these lands."
 annex.240.a:0 "Give it freely to the Pope."
 annex.240.b:0 "Propose a deal: the land for a submission."
 annex.240.c:0 "Continue the occupation!"

 annex.241.t:0 "Our Rightful Land"
 annex.241.d:0 "A generous power in the north has decided to respect the treaty of 1919 and give back the land they occupied to their rightful owner, us. We'll evidently have to thank them for this great victory of our state."
 annex.241.a:0 "The Papal lands are reunited."

 annex.242.t:0 "A Generous Proposition?"
 annex.242.d:0 "The occupying power in the north sent diplomats to Rome today to propose us a diplomatic deal. They would agree to return the lands that were stolen to us during the bloody civil war of 1919 for the simple condition of accepting to stop any independent initiative in our foreign policy, in other words, become a satellite. This proposal, while endangering our sovereignty has the merit of bringing us back the vast territories that we were promised. It will have to be judged and answered to accordingly."
 annex.242.a:0 "Accept the proposal, get back our land."
 annex.242.b:0 "We'll never bow down!"

 annex.243.t:0 "The Pope Accepted the Deal!"
 annex.243.d:0 "The Pope has sent back our diplomats with good news, he accepted the proposal to abandon his control over his foreign policy for the safe return of his land in the North. It is now time to apply the conditions of the deal."
 annex.243.a:0 "Very good."

 annex.244.t:0 "The Pope Refused the Deal!"
 annex.244.d:0 "The Pope has reportedly angrily sent back our diplomats, outraged at the idea of a submission of the Holy See to any invader. It seems our deal never had a chance to be accepted after all."
 annex.244.a:0 "Who do they think are? They won't get an inch back!"

 annexation_PAL_CONQ:0 "The Fate of Palestine"
 annexation_PAL_CONQ_desc:0 "Our armies have taken control of the southern part of the Levant, and the local Palestinian population is clamouring for self-government. We should decide what's to be done with the region."
 annex.247.a:0 "Release a Palestinian government."
 annex.247.b:0 "Give it to our [TUR.GetAdjective] allies."
 annex.247.c:0 "Give it to our [SYR.GetAdjective] allies."
 annex.247.d:0 "Give it to our [EGY.GetAdjective] allies."

 annex.281.t:0 "An Offer from [From.GetNameDef]"
 annex.281.d.allitaly:0 "A delegation from [From.GetNameDef] has arrived with an offer: in exchange for us assuming control over most of Italy, the lands now in [From.GetAdjective] possession, they ask for [Root.GetNameDef] to join the [From.GetFactionName]. It is a tempting offer, though it means abandoning any of our current alliances and wars."
 annex.281.d.centralitaly:0 "A delegation from [From.GetNameDef] has arrived with an offer: in exchange for us assuming control over much of Central Italy, the lands now in [From.GetAdjective] possession, they ask for [Root.GetNameDef] to join the [From.GetFactionName]. It is a tempting offer, though it means abandoning any of our current alliances and wars."
 annex.281.d.piedmont:0 "A delegation from [From.GetNameDef] has arrived with an offer: in exchange for us returning to the mainland and assuming control over Piedmont, now in [From.GetAdjective] possession, they ask for [Root.GetNameDef] to join the [From.GetFactionName]. It is a tempting offer, though it means abandoning any of our current alliances and wars."
 annex.281.a:0 "We agree to their alliance"
 annex.281.b:0 "Absolutely not"

 annex.282.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Agrees"
 annex.282.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government was more than happy to exchange the return of their land for an alliance with us."
 annex.282.a:0 "Excellent!"

 annex.283.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] has Refused"
 annex.283.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government apparently does not want their lands back badly enough, or do not trust our offer. Either way, they have refused to join our alliance."
 annex.283.a:0 "Their loss, it seems"

 annex.284.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Abandons the [Root.GetFactionName]"
 annex.284.d:0 "It appears an offer made by [From.From.GetNameDef] for the return of lands in Italy was too much for [From.GetNameDef] to refuse. They have abandoned our alliance and joined the [From.From.GetFactionName]. Perhaps it is land we could never have delivered to them, but even so - it is a bitter pill to swallow."
 annex.284.a:0 "Hopefully we do not end up on opposing sides"
