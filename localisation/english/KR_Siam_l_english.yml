### Leaders ###
# Mahidol Line
 # Prajadhipok:
 POLITICS_RAMA_VII_DESC:0 "Prajadhipok, also known by his regnal name Rama VII, was enthroned as King of Siam upon the death of his brother in 1925. Unprepared for kingship, having previously been far down the order of succession, he is essentially a puppet of the Supreme Council of State run by his cousins. Educated abroad and commissioned in the British Army, Prajadhipok nonetheless genuinely cares for his people and works diligently to improve his subjects' lot."
 # Ananda Mahidol:
 POLITICS_RAMA_VIII_DESC:0 "Ananda Mahidol, known by his regnal name Rama VIII, has ascended to the Siamese throne following the death of his uncle, Rama VII. Ananda Mahidol was once considered a very unlikely candidate for the throne, being barely a teenager and of low birth. He originally held the rank of 'Mom Chao', making him among the lowest of Siamese princes. Despite his youth and inexperience, he has quickly won the hearts of the Siamese people. Foreign observers, however, believe that he did not really want to be king that his reign would not last long. "
 # Bhumibol Adulyadej:
 POLITICS_RAMA_VIX_DESC:0 "Bhumibol Adulyadej, known by his regnal name Rama IX has ascended to the Siamese throne following the mysterious death of his late brother, Rama VIII. Bhumibol Adulyadej has so far proven himself much more politically competent than his late brother, navigating the convoluted Siamese political landscape with seeming ease. Many speak of Bhumibol Adulyadej as the saviour of the once embattled Siamese monarchy"

# Paribatra Line
 # Paribatra Sukhumbhand:
 POLITICS_SUKHUMBHAND_DESC:0 "Paribatra Sukhumbhand, cousin to expected successor to the Siamese throne Ananda Mahidol, has seized control of the Siamese government, citing Ananda's inexperience and his age. With the full support of the Privy Council, he has crowned himself as King Rama VIII, firmly establishing the Boripatr cadet branch as the new ruling house."
 # Chumbhotbongs Paribatra:
 POLITICS_CHUMBHOTBONGS_PARIBATRA_DESC:0 "Chumbhotbongs Paribatra, known by his regnal name Rama IX, has succeeded his father, Rama VIII, to the throne of Siam. Chumbhotbongs Paribatra is something of a recluse, but still politically competent. He is a known patron of the arts, having converted multiple state-owned properties into museums, and has personally sponsored many great artists both in Siam and abroad."
 POLITICS_SUKHUMABHININDA_DESC:0 "Sukhumbhinanda, son of former King Paribatra Sukhumbhand (Rama VIII) and a lowborn woman, was legitimised by his brother King Rama IX due to the latter's inability to produce a male heir. He has ascended to the throne as Rama X. Sukhumbhinanda is a prominent philanthropist whose efforts to relieve Bangkok's poorest have garnered him much publicity. With Sukhumbhinanda's ascension much of the remaining public discontent with the monarchy has dissipated."

# Chrakrabongse Line
 POLITICS_CHULA_CHAKRABONGSE_DESC:0 "Chula Chakrabongse, the half-Ukrainian grandson of King Rama V, has been installed as king of Siam. Chula Chakrabongse lived an eccentric life of leisure in Britain and later Austria before becoming king and has delegated nearly all of his royal duties in favour of his passion for both horse and automobile racing."

# Left
 POLITICS_SUPHA_SIRIMANON_DESC:0 "Journalist, Poet, and now the new Premier of the Republic - Supha Sirimanon looked like an odd choice for the national leadership position at first. Within the leftist intelligentsia community though, he is more well-known under his pen name \"Jittin Thammachart\", and as the translator behind Das Kapital's Thai language publication.\n\nWhile an adherent of Classical Marxism at heart, Supha is a Pragmatist and viewed Planned Economy as the way forward - and that there's no way for the Workers and Capitalists to reconcile with each other."
 # Pridi Phanomyong at the onset of the CW:
 POLITICS_PRIDI_PANOMYONG_DESC:0 "Pridi Phanomyong, also known by his ministerial title 'Luang Praditmanutham', immediately set out to better the lives of the Siamese people upon his appointment as a minister. His controversial 'Yellow Cover Dossier' outlined his political and economic reform agenda and divided the Siamese government, but the controversy only served to further Pridi's political career."
 # Pridi Phanomyong after winning his rebellion:
 POLITICS_PRIDI_PANOMYONG_REBEL_WIN_DESC:0 "Pridi Phanmoyong, previously known by his ministerial title 'Luang Praditmanutham', has become the Chairman of the Sapha Prachachon following a brief but bloody Siamese Civil War. Phanomyong's policies of economic nationalisation and radical parliamentarian reform may now continue, however challenges from more radical elements within Pridi's Sahachip Party have grown significantly. Despite his popularity, Phanomyong struggles to maintain his authority even with his allies in the Navy."

# Right
 # Plaek Phibunsongkhram after Coup d'état:
 POLITICS_PLAEK_KHITTASANGKHA_DESC:0 "Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram, more popularly known as 'Chormpon Por' by the locals and 'Phibun' in the West, the one-time ally of Pridi Phanmoyong and the People's Party has seized power following the Yellow Cover Dossier Affair. Together with Luang Wichitwathakarn and his allies in the military he has built his own cult of personality to side-line the Monarchy. He views the current state of Siam as an 'outdated relic of a bygone era' and intends to use his power to promote militarism and nationalism, proclaiming both to be additional essential principles of the modern nation."
 # Phao Sriyanond:
 POLITICS_PHAO_SRIYANOND_DESC:0 "Police Chief Phao Sriyanond has succeeded Plaek Phibunsongkhram as leader of Siam's military regime with the support of the Soi Ratchakhru Clique. Phao is known for his brutality and political cunning, and his political opponents tend to 'disappear'. Phao also believes the Siamese monarchy to be an antiquated relic which impairs the cause of nationalism, and is thus an avowed Republican"
 # Sarit Thanarat:
 POLITICS_SARIT_THANARAT_DESC:0 "General Sarit Thanarat has succeeded Plaek Phibunsongkhram as leader of Siam's military regime with the support of the Sisao Thawaet Clique. Originally a lowly officer in the Phayap Army, he quickly rose through the ranks with Plaek and Phin's help. An ardent anti-Syndicalist, he views the Monarchy as an important tool against the reds and as the focal point of Thai Nationalism."

# Republic
 POLITICS_THAWAN_THAMRONGNAWASAWAT_DESC:0 "Nicknamed the 'Golden-Tongue Statesman', Thawan is renowned for his public speaking and debating skills, which he fully exploits for his coalition building. As a champion of the grassroots, the ex-Admiral favours policies which helps the common people, such as price ceiling for household commodities and expansion of public welfare. However, these policies also put him at odds with the capitalists and the burgeoning Thai-Chinese middle class who are burdened with greater taxes."
 POLITICS_POTE_SARASIN_DESC:0 "A Thai-Chinese from upper middle-class background, Pote Sarasin's experience in the Ministry of Finance during the Black Monday has shaped his worldview. As fan of the Austrian economist Hayek and a strict adherence to the law, he is against the expansion of state-owned enterprises while trying to ensure the fair, free and open competition. Another policy of his being the expansion of higher education across the nation as a mean to reinvigorate the recovering local industries."
 POLITICS_SENI_PRAMOJ_DESC:0 "As a member of a cadet branch of the Chakri Dynasty with Chinese ancestry, Seni may appear as an odd choice of leader for a republican Siamese state. Despite that, this 'Young Viper' managed to gather enough political clout among the many conservative circles with his own political shrewdness rather than his familial connection to gain a working majority for the new government to function properly. His policy of 'Ngoen Phan' (Money Fluctuation) helps keep the rural area happy and secured from the Syndicalist hands. Whether if he only pays lip services to the republican causes, however, remains to be seen..."

### Leader Traits ###
 SIA_iron_marshal_trait:0 "The Iron Field Marshal\n§gBeing known for his charismatic and cunning leadership since his interwar years in Burma, it is no surprise that Phibun would eventually land himself on top of the pecking order. His obsession for total control of the state affairs and his attitude of side-lining the monarchy earned him another nickname - \"Siamese Cao Cao/Caesar\".§!"
 SIA_pho_khun_trait:0 "The Paternal Despot\n§gInspired by Sukhothai's era notion of Pho Khun (Patriarchal rule) and Ayuthaya's despotic rulership, Sarit felt such ruling style fits his political taste the best. He viewed himself as the foremost leader to guide the country through its \"Patiwat\" (revolutionary) phase against the rising leftist tides.§!"
 SIA_under_pho_khun_trait:0 "Paternal Despot's Close Confidant\n§gHis majesty the king is now properly put back on the throne, mimicking Ayuthaya's despotic rulership-style of the past. Whether if the king himself is personally involved with Sarit Thanarat's rise to power, we will never know for sure.§!"
 SIA_prancing_knight_trait:0 "The Prancing Knight\n§gOne simply does not rise to the top position without deceit and deception - Phao lacks neither and is ready to smack down any opposition utilising both trickery and his own heavily militarised police forces in tow.§!"

## Introduction Events ##
 siam.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of [SIA.GetSIAshortname] in 1936"
 siam.1.d:0 "One of the countries that benefited from German victory during the Weltkrieg, [SIA.GetSIAshortname] regained most of its former land which had previously been lost to the western imperialists. While [SIA.GetSIAshortname]'s relationship with the Huns is, in general, cordial, the fact that they thwarted her expansionist ambitions during the 1929 Intervention in Burma has strained diplomatic and military ties between the two. If [SIA.GetSIAshortname] should reconcile with the Germans or align itself with others power is a matter to be decided in the coming decade."
 siam.1.a:0 "Interesting, tell me more!"
 siam.1.b:0 "I've a good grasp of the general situation."

 siam.2.t:0 "The State of Politics"
 siam.2.d:0 "Ever since the coronation of King Rama VII in 1925 most, if not all, of the policies set forth within [SIA.GetSIAshortname] have been dictated by the Aphiratthamontri Sapha (Supreme Council of State). This is a council made up of the King's older siblings, who have continually worked to consolidate their power while keeping the power of the king over the nation weakened. Despite promising the [SIA.GetProperAdjective] intelligentsia that a codified constitution would be issued any reform has been tough to pass, as it would be against the interests of the nobility.\n\nSurrounded by enemies, such as the Konbaung dynasty to the west, Yunnanese bandits to the north, and the German imperialists to the east, [SIA.GetSIAshortname] is in a dire situation. It will either perish, forever confined to the pages of a history book, or shall reform itself and emerge a modern state, be it by negotiation or by force."
 siam.2.a:0 "I pity the poor king..."

 siam.3.t:0 "The Kingdom's Many Other Problems"
 siam.3.d:0 "While seemingly economically and industrially prosperous to outside eyes, [SIA.GetSIAshortname] is actually very reliant on investments made by Germany and must cherish the economic ties it shares with the nation. Industry is a very fragile and small section of the economy, which is mainly built around rice, sugar, and timber exports. Nationalism among ethnic minorities has been rising, which raises the spectre of separatist movements in the near future. Moreover: the bloated bureaucratic system, which has been present since the reign of Rama VI, has siphoned off much needed taxes and thus allowed for bandits to continually run wild in the fringes of [SIA.GetSIAshortname]."
 siam.3.a:0 "I'd rather pick the Philippines."

## Black Monday and Early political chaos # Max Reform 7 - Lowest 0: 0-2 = Khana Ratsadon coup, 3-4 = Civil War with Prajadhipok Bias (based on Boworadet Rebellion), 5-6 = success, 7 = Reactionary coup with Paribatra as HoS
 siam.4.t:0 "Black Monday hits [SIA.GetSIAshortname]!"
 siam.4.d:0 "Due to its heavy reliance on its economic ties with Germany Black Monday has quickly dragged [SIA.GetSIAshortname] into an economic abyss as demand for her main agricultural exports has fallen sharply and shipments have been left to wither in their warehouses. Clerks working for foreign companies are continually being laid off, while the people have begun to gather around the Grand Palace looking for hope. It is apparent that we must do something about our economic situation lest it worsen and send us spiralling further down."
 siam.4.a:0 "Khun Prah!"

 siam.5.t:0 "Jasmine Rice Problems"
 siam.5.d:0 "One of the largest exporters of rice within [SIA.GetSIAshortname], the farmers across the Chao Phraya, have asked for government intervention to deal with the excessive supply of rice due to a general fall in demand and fewer export opportunities after Black Monday."
 #-200, +2 reform:
 siam.5.a:0 "Purchase most of the rice to help stabilise the price."
 #-100, +1 reform:
 siam.5.b:0 "Agree to buy up some excess rice."
 #0, 0 reform:
 siam.5.c:0 "The free market shall resolve the issue!"

 siam.6.t:0 "Bloated Bureaucracy"
 siam.6.d:0 "The modern bureaucratic system was formed during the reign of Rama V and had been greatly expanded by Rama VI. However, it has proved to be too large to effectively serve the state. Firing more people, however, would mean an increase in the unemployment rate at exactly the time when we want it to drop."
 # 0 reform:
 siam.6.a:0 "Lay off a few of our clerks."
 #-100, +1 reform:
 siam.6.b:0 "Lay off managers and ministers."
 #-200, +2 reform:
 siam.6.c:0 "Allow the status-quo for now."

 siam.7.t:0 "Military Expenditure"
 siam.7.d:0 "[SIA.GetSIAshortname] currently spends up to 25% of her annual revenue on the preservation and maintenance of the military-industrial complex, as she is surrounded by both historical enemies and imperialistic westerners who desire her land. However perhaps slightly cutting our military expenditures wouldn't hurt us too much?"
 #-10 for 3 years, 0 reform:
 siam.7.a:0 "Cut any and all research funding."
 #-10 for 3 years, +1 reform:
 siam.7.b:0 "Cut everything bar the development of new rifles."
 #-200, +2 reform:
 siam.7.c:0 "We shouldn't show any weaknesses!"

 siam.8.t:0 "Emergency Tax"
 siam.8.d:0 "Even though we've enacted many sweeping reforms we still do not have enough money to sufficiently balance this year's budget. An emergency tax should help remedy this situation but will create more suffering for our loyal subjects."
 #+50, 0 reform:
 siam.8.a:0 "Increase the income tax rate!"
 #+10, +1 reform:
 siam.8.b:0 "Double the inheritance tax!"
 #+30, -5 NP, +1 reform:
 siam.8.c:0 "Lift the ban on gambling."

## New Governmnet Established for Siam ##
 siam.10.t:0 "The Khana Ratsadon's Provisional Cabinet"
 siam.10.d:0 "Following the bloodless revolution we must rebuild the nation from the ground up. Luang Praditmanutham, head of the civilian faction of the provisional government and a prominent leftist, is now working on the creation of a formal constitution while others are beginning to educate the masses about the merits and workings of parliamentary democracy. Alongside all of this Phraya Phahonponpayuhasena has readied his troops, in case of an opportunistic invasion by foreign powers."
 siam.10.a:0 "This is a great leap forward for [SIA.GetSIAshortname]!"

 siam.11.t:0 "The Khanagummakarn Ratsadon's Provisional Cabinet"
 siam.11.d:0 "Following the ratification of the constitution the People's Committee, a group chosen by Prajadhipok himself, has begun the education of the masses in the ways of proper parliamentary democracy.\n\nHeaded by the [SIA.GetProperAdjective] Court, the Committee is also responsible for educational, health, and industrialisation reforms. The path ahead for [SIA.GetSIAshortname] will hardly be a stroll in the park but a bright future does await our great nation."
 siam.11.a:0 "This a great leap forward for the [SIA.GetProperAdjective] people!"

## Khana Ratsadon 1936 Election and subsequent Civil War ##

 siam.12.t:0 "The "Yellow Cover Dossier" Affair"
 siam.12.d:0 "Today Luang Praditmanutham, Minister of State and a member of the People's Party, presented the draft of his "National Economic Development Plan" proposal to the National Assembly.\n\nKnown as the "Yellow Cover Dossier" the plan details the formation of a welfare state, redistribution of land, state intervention in the private sector, and a system of subsidies for farmers.\n\nSome have compared the proposal to that of a syndicalist while others have agreed that the reforms will greatly improve the lives of the [SIA.GetProperAdjective] people.\n\nAll that remains is to see what his majesty has to say..."
 siam.12.a:0 "His Majesty agrees with Praditmanutham."
 siam.12.b:0 "His Majesty supports a watered down proposal."
 siam.12.c:0 "His Majesty demands the arrest of the syndicalist sympathiser!"

 siam.13.t:0 "Prajadhipok's Reply"
 siam.13.d:0 "King Prajadhipok's reply has arrived and is heavily critical of Luang Praditmanutham's draft, going so far as to accuse Praditmanutham of being a syndicalist! An emergency session of the chief members of the People's Party has led to the party deciding to..."
 siam.13.a:0 "... back down for the moment."
 siam.13.b:0 "... file a lawsuit against the King."

 siam.14.t:0 "Domestic Tensions"
 siam.14.d:0 "Thawan Ritthidet, a private citizen, has recently filed a lawsuit against the King; accusing him of intervention in political, state, and economic affairs. The fallout over Luang Praditmanutham's plan has further divided the cabinet and has pitted the Royalists and the Parliamentarians against each other."
 siam.14.a:0 "Reconciliation is in order, it seems."
 siam.14.b:0 "Arrest those Syndicalists!"

 siam.15.t:0 "Plaek Phibunsongkhram's Dilemma"
 siam.15.d:0 "A political crisis is currently ongoing and has nearly reached the boiling point! Tensions are high and we must take steps to remedy the situation. What shall we do?"
 siam.15.a:0 "It's treason then! (Side with the Parliamentarians)"
 siam.15.b:0 "HM's dignity must be upheld! (Side with the Royalists)"
 siam.15.c:0 "Try to end this factional bickering."

 siam.16.t:0 "Dawn of the Siamese Civil War"
 siam.16.prd:0 "Despite the chief of the armed forces declaring his allegiance to the monarchy, a small mutiny in Sattahip and Morlumlerng by the navy has quickly grown out of control and has now engulfed the entire nation in chaos."
 siam.16.ppd:0 "Despite the chief of the armed forces declaring his allegiance to the new cabinet, a small mutiny in Lopburi and Nakhon Ratchasima by the army has quickly grown out of control and has now engulfed the entire nation in chaos."
 siam.16.pra:0 "For the country! (Rebel side)"
 siam.16.prb:0 "For the king! (Government side)"
 siam.16.ppa:0 "For the country! (Government side)"
 siam.16.ppb:0 "For the king! (Rebel side)"

 siam.18.t:0 "The Reclamation of Bangkok"
 siam.18.d:0 "The Siamese Civil War has recently taken an unexpected turn for the better, as our side has managed to reclaim Bangkok. This is a shattering blow to the opposition and thus, while some ministers in the illegitimate government have fled abroad, most have complied with our demands and have promptly laid down their arms."
 siam.18.a:0 "The Royalists have reclaimed power!"
 siam.18.b:0 "Syndicalism shall guide our nation!"

 siam.20.t:0 "End of the [SIA.GetNonIdeologyAdjective] Civil War"
 siam.20.d.government_parliamentarian:0 "After the reclamation of our eastern and southern regions by government forces the remaining revolutionaries have decided to flee to Saigon, where we must contend with extradition procedures. It is more important to first mourn the losses sustained during the war by our loyal subjects. A countrywide public funeral has been held, with the remains of our loyal subjects carried through [GetSIAprefixTH]damnoen road to Sanam Luang where King Prajadhipok has given us permission to set up a public funeral pyre on the sacred royal cremation ground."
 siam.20.d.government_royalist:0 "After subduing most of the separatists and rebels we have received word that the remaining rebels have fled to Yunnan. No matter, for we shall catch what remains of the rebel scum later. We must first mourn the losses sustained by our loyal men, to that end the royal cremation ground has been converted into a public pyre. Prajadhipok, who was largely unrelated to the rebellion, has been permitted to return to the Grand Palace."
 siam.20.d.rebel_parliamentarian:0 "After the reclamation of our eastern and southern regions by government forces the remaining revolutionaries have decided to flee to Saigon, where we must contend with extradition procedures. It is more important to first mourn the losses sustained during the war by our loyal subjects. A countrywide public funeral has been held, with the remains of our loyal subjects carried through [GetSIAprefixTH]damnoen road to Sanam Luang where King Prajadhipok has given us permission to set up a public funeral pyre on the sacred royal cremation ground."
 siam.20.d.rebel_royalist:0 "After subduing most of the rebels we have received word that the remaining royalists have fled to Yunnan with the king. No matter, for we shall catch what remains of the loyalist scum later. We must first mourn the losses sustained by our loyal men, to that end the royal cremation ground has been converted into a public pyre."
 # Plaek Parliamentarian, Government:
 siam.20.a:0 "Long live may our Democracy be!"
 # Plaek Royalist, Government:
 siam.20.b:0 "Long live the King!"
 # Plaek Royalist, Rebel:
 siam.20.c:0 "Long live the King!"
 # Plaek Parliamentarians, Rebel; Chaiyo = Hurrah in Thai:
 siam.20.d:0 "Chaiyo for the Republic!"

 siam.21.t:0 "Royalist Rebels Surrender (AI side)"
 siam.21.d:0 "This event isn't meant to fire for Human players - please report this as a bug if this appears to you"
 siam.21.a:0 "They surrendered (Parliamentarians)"

 siam.22.t:0 "Plaek Phibunsongkhram's Coup D'état"
 siam.22.d:0 "As time has passed and people have adjusted to the seizure of power, the situation in [SIA.GetSIAshortname] has finally begun to stabilise. It is finally time to..."
 siam.22.a:0 "... repeal martial law."
 siam.22.b:0 "... take power for ourselves."

 #1936:
 siam.23.t:0 "[GetYear] General Election"
 siam.23.d.syn:0 "Following the purge of the conservatives from all chambers of the government and the dismantling of the power of nobility, the results of the election are pretty clear."
 siam.23.d.con:0 "Following the purge of the socialists from all chambers of the government, in addition to the banning of their organisations, the results of the election are pretty clear."
 siam.23.d.norm:0 "The predictions made in the polls with regards to this election have been very close. However, it seems as though one side has managed to eke out a majority in parliament."
 siam.23.a:0 "The liberals have emerged victorious!"
 siam.23.b:0 "The socialists have emerged victorious!"
 siam.23.c:0 "The conservatives have emerged victorious!"

## Industrial Nationalizaion ##

 siam.26.t:0 "The Question of German-Owned Factories"
 siam.26.d:0 "Prominent German businesses within the [SIA.GetName] are mostly linked to the shipping, logging and railway industries. A large loan on good terms from the government might easily convince them to kick-start their operations again, though we could simply seize their factories as well. Doing so, however, could mean economic suicide for the [SIA.GetName]. How should we approach the situation?"
 siam.26.a:0 "Seize the means of production!."
 siam.26.b:0 "Offer monetary compensation."
 siam.26.c:0 "Let's look elsewhere..."

 siam.27.t:0 "[SIA.GetSIAshortname] Seizes Our Factories!"
 siam.27.d.bast:0 "The new [SIA.GetProperAdjective] government has begun their 'Industrial Nationalisation' programme in order to help strengthen their economy. Our factories in the [SIA.GetName] have been wrongfully seized by the military junta of Premier Plaek Phibunsongkhram."
 siam.27.d.comp:0 "The new [SIA.GetProperAdjective] government has begun their 'Industrial Nationalisation' programme in order to help strengthen their economy. Our factories in the [SIA.GetName] have been wrongfully seized by the military junta of Premier Plaek Phibunsongkhram. He has, however, offered us monetary compensation for our losses."
 siam.27.a:0 "Those bastards!"
 siam.27.b:0 "At least they've given us compensation."

 siam.28.t:0 "The Question of American-Owned Factories"
 siam.28.d:0 "The American car company, Ford, have their South-East Asian operations based here in Ayutthaya. Due to political and economic strife in the States it is unlikely that the United States would retaliate if we were to seize the factory. What shall we do?"

 siam.29.t:0 "The Question of Canadian-Owned Rubber Plantations"
 siam.29.d:0 "With the British in South-East Asia forced to retreat to Australasia following the British Revolution, many private rubber plantations in Sirat Malai have been left deserted for some time by their former owners. While we could simply seize the plantations, doing so would upset the Australasians who are a major naval power in the Asia-Pacific region and, potentially, allies. What shall we do?"

 siam.30.t:0 "The Question of Japanese-Owned Iron Mines"
 siam.30.d:0 "The Japanese own a few iron mines in Yala and Nakhon Si Thammarat which are used to transfer key raw materials to their home islands. While we could potentially seize the mines doing so would alienate us and permanently damage [SIA.GetProperAdjective]-Japanese relations, leaving us without a powerful ally to help challenge the German hegemony in the region. What shall we do?"

 siam.31.t:0 "Phibunsongkhram Criticised For Weak Foreign Policy"
 siam.31.d:0 "Due to the National Industrialisation Scheme bringing about little to no economic change our opponents in the media and political arena alike have accused us of weak and ineffective leadership."
 siam.31.a:0 "Damn it!"

## Siamese- Burmese War (NatPop) ##

 siam.32.t:0 "Burmese Agitators Captured"
 siam.32.d:0 "Eleven Burmese agitators in Morlumlerng, one of the Mon majority cities near the Salween River delta, were caught today spreading pamphlets which bore the slogan 'Liberation From The [SIA.GetProperAdjective] Yoke'. Perhaps we can take advantage of this event to help rally support for our regime and finish off the Burmese threat once and for all!"
 siam.32.a:0 "Who said we were cowards?"
 siam.32.b:0 "A chance to show them who's boss!"
 siam.32.c:0 "We aren't ready for that right now..."

 siam.33.t:0 "[SIA.GetNameDefCap] Has Declared War!"
 siam.33.d:0 "Bad news! Apparently the [SIA.GetProperAdjective] have caught eleven "Burmese spies", despite them being in what is rightfully our territory. Their army is now advancing towards Yangon. This is outrageous!"
 siam.33.a:0 "To arms, citizens!"

 # Siamese Wins:
 siam.34.t:0 "Treaty of Thawai"
 siam.34.d:0 "The decadent Burmese in Yangon have been routed and our forces are securely entrenched in the smouldering remains of their capital. Now is the best time to demand concessions from the Burmese government, victory is ours. The question is: should we seek peace or continue fighting the war until we've rid ourselves of the Burmese forever?"
 siam.34.a:0 "We'll demand Upper Shan and reunite the Thais."
 siam.34.b:0 "No peace with the Burmese, total conquest!"

 siam.35.t:0 "Demands of the [SIA.GetProperAdjective]"
 siam.35.d:0 "The [SIA.GetProperAdjective] dogs have completely overpowered us and we are humiliated. Now they've demanded we surrender the Upper Shan states. Although these are harsh terms it might be wise to comply, lest our rivals in the region act upon our weakened situation."
 siam.35.a:0 "We have no other choice..."
 siam.35.b:0 "They must be joking, Kaba Ma Kyei!"

 siam.36.t:0 "The Burmese Government Refuses!"
 siam.36.d:0 "The foolish Burmese have refused our generous offer."
 siam.36.a:0 "The war must continue, it seems..."

 # Burmese Wins:
 siam.37.t:0 "Treaty of Thawai"
 siam.37.d:0 "The decadent [SIA.GetProperAdjective] in Bangkok have been routed and our forces are securely entrenched in the smouldering remains of Chiang Mai. Now is the best time to demand concessions from the [SIA.GetProperAdjective] government, victory is ours. The question is: should we seek peace or continue fighting the war until we've rid ourselves of the [SIA.GetProperAdjective]?"
 siam.37.a:0 "We shall take back our rightful territory."
 siam.37.b:0 "No peace with the [SIA.GetProperAdjective], total conquest!"

 siam.38.t:0 "Demands of the Burmese"
 siam.38.d:0 "The Burmese dogs have completely overpowered us and we are humiliated. Now they've demanded we surrender the Lower Shan and Morlumlerng states. Although these are harsh terms it might be wise to comply, lest our rivals in the region act upon our weakened situation."
 siam.38.a:0 "We have no other choice..."
 siam.38.b:0 "They must be joking, Rao Suu Mai Thoi!"

 siam.39.t:0 "The [SIA.GetProperAdjective] Government Refuses!"
 siam.39.d:0 "The foolish [SIA.GetProperAdjective] have refused our rightful claims."
 siam.39.a:0 "The war must continue, it seems..."

## Phibunsongkhram's Ratthaniyom Reform, Assassination attempt and its aftermath ##

It was not until 1913 that the [ROOT.GetSIAprefixEN] [SIA.GetProperAdjective] Marine Corps were reorganised into the modern \"Navy Amphibious Assault Group\" who saw some action back in the Weltkrieg.
