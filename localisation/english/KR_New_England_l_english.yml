### Leaders ###
###############
 POLITICS_LEWIS_BARROWS_DESC:0 "Born in Newport, Maine on June 7th, 1893 - Barrows studied in local schools around Newport before attending the University of Maine with a degree in pharmacy. His political career began to take off after holding local positions in Newport such as serving as the treasurer and as an eventual state committeeman under the Republican Party. As the nation descended into chaos in 1936, Maine remained unscathed from much of the violence and Barrows made sure that Maine would remain free from radicalism under his leadership as Maine Secretary of State.\n\nWith the arrival of the second civil war among the states of the former United States of America, Barrows along with prominent New England politicians and governors were among those who appealed to Canada for protection. Representing what is left of the Republican Party, Barrows has been nominated to serve as an interim president in the hopes of securing the eventual restoration of American democracy. Serving alongside President Barrows is Vice President Henry Styles Bridges, the former governor of New Hampshire. A teacher and businessman, Styles Bridges was the youngest state governor of the time and now is eager to join Barrows' administration."

 POLITICS_DAVID_WALSH_DESC:0 "Born in Leominster, Massachusetts, on November 11, 1872 - Walsh attended local public schools in his youth before attending Boston University Law school, after which he was admitted to the bar. Rising to politics in a longtime Republican district as a Democrat, Walsh proposed increased government responsibility for charity work and the mentally ill and pushed for censorship of the racist film "Birth of a Nation." Indeed, Walsh is a staunch opponent of the racism that pervades American society; in the 1924 Democratic National Convention, he condemned the Ku Klux Klan. A champion of modern labour standards, Walsh has found a robust voting base among the working classes of New England.\n\nNoted for his political populism and seemingly luxurious lifestyle, Walsh served successful terms as Massachusetts's first Irish-Catholic senator. When the great civil war broke out, Walsh quickly ascended to the head of the Democratic Party in New England. A prominent advocate of isolation during the Weltkrieg, Walsh has attracted the annoyance of his Canadian neighbours due to his anti-imperialist views. While Canadian-American ties are ever closer, Walsh's anti-interventionist stances will surely bring conflict between the two nations.\n\nServing alongside President Walsh is none other than former Rhode Island Senator Theodore Green. A vigorous member of the Democratic Party despite his age, Green stands opposed to Walsh's isolationism - instead of believing that America's path lies in aiding the rest of the free world."

 POLITICS_JOSEPH_MARTIN_JR_DESC:0 "Born in North Attleborough, Massachusetts, on November 3, 1884 - Joseph Martin Jr came from an Irish New England family and spent his youth playing ball and working as a newspaper editor. A so-called "compassionate conservative," Martin supports the use of conservative techniques and concepts to significantly improve society's welfare.\n\nAscending from a career of local and then state politics for Massachusetts, Martin secured a position in Congress as a Representative for the Republican Party. As the nation descended into chaos and a new interim President was hastily chosen, Martin was elected on a combined coalition party of Democrats and Republicans.\n\nHis Vice President is the former Democratic governor of Massachusetts and conservative Democrat Joseph B. Ely. Achieving fame among New Englanders due to his handling of the Great Depression, Ely has been chosen by the compromise committee due to his role in combating unemployment and poverty. While the tensions between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party still exist, a house divided against itself cannot stand in America's darkest hour."

 POLITICS_WILBUR_CROSS_DESC:0 "Born in Mansfield, Connecticut in 1862 - Cross is renowned across the American literary scene for his talented work in analyzing English literature. From academia, Cross competed for the position of governorship for the state of Connecticut of which he won successfully. With the outbreak of the civil war, Cross finds himself in a precarious position following the Canadian occupation of New England. One of the many Americans who petitioned the Canadian government to intervene, Cross's openness to embrace the Entente's arrival into America has led some to suspect that he is no more than a mere puppet of the former British Empire. While he is on paper the leader of a provisional government led by Ottawa, he is also the temporary interim leader of New England until a suitable President is chosen."

 POLITICS_CHARLES_HURLEY_DESC:0 "Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on November 24th, 1893 - Hurley's early life was marked with tragedy as he lost both his parents at a young age. He was then raised by the family housekeeper, a former US District Attorney, before attending Boston College and becoming a salesman in athletic goods. Hurley then embarked on a career in local politics before ascending to the position of Massachusetts State Treasurer for three consecutive terms as a Democrat. The success of his political run convinced him of greater political aspirations, and he ran successfully for governor in the 1936 election. As the nation descended into chaos, the Irish-American governor sought to resolve tensions between Yankee Protestants and Irish-American Catholics. In the wake of the destructive 1938 New England Hurricane, Hurley oversaw the relief and rebuilding efforts for the city of Boston.\n\nNow the newly elected 33rd President of the United States finds himself in a much greater position, the defender of American democracy in the wake of radicals and reactionaries. Serving alongside Hurley is fellow Democrat Peter Gerry, a wealthy senator from the state of Rhode Island. Gerry was tutored and mentored by none other than Canadian politician William Lyon Mackenzie King in his youth."

 POLITICS_JOHN_WINANT_DESC:0 "Born on the East Side of New York City on February 23, 1889 - John Winant came from a prosperous family and attended Princeton University, although his marks were relatively poor. After a brief stint in the army, Winant entered state politics by elected to the New Hampshire Senate. Following a successful career in the Senate, Winant ascended to Governor of New Hampshire under the Republican Party from 1925-1927 and then from 1931-1935. He achieved state-wide fame for his handling of the decades-long economic depression that had beset America. Active in the Square Deal policies that helped end the depression in New England, Winant has easily been chosen among his party to lead New England onwards in its most challenging days. Following his governorship, Winant ascended to the powerful position of being the American ambassador to Canada where he played a hand in the many interactions between the Provisional Government and the Canadian nation. The 33rd President of the United States faces a broken nation but is eager to reunite and take its place once more as the hegemon of the New World.\n\nServing alongside Winant is Frederick Hale, a Maine lawyer and Senator from Harvard University. A long-time Republican and chairman of the Committee of Canadian Relations - Hale has espoused fierce anti-Ku Klux Klan views in public and has not been afraid to denounce them."

 POLITICS_RAYMOND_BALDWIN_DESC:0 "Born in Rye, New York on August 31, 1893 - Raymond Baldwin's home state became Connecticut after moving there at a young age and spending his college years at Yale. Baldwin participated in the Stratford Town Court as a prosecutor, eventually advancing to judge of the town court in 1931. As the country fell apart, the governor of Connecticut, Baldwin, was among those who petitioned the Canadian government to intervene due to the civil war. To ensure the safety of the people of New England, Baldwin supervised a complex array of civil defenses and statewide services on the homefront which grew his popularity within the Republican Party. He certainly has his work cut out for him as the nation reels from the horror of the great war - only time will tell whether or not Baldwin's hand will lead to prosperity and peace in the future.\n\nServing alongside Baldwin, New Yorker Irving Ives, a man whose family dates back to the first settlers who settled in New England. Re-elected many times in the New York State Assembly, Ives publicly expressed his desire to end workplace discrimination based on race, creed, and colour. Together, both men have vowed to reunite and rebuild America once and for all under the leadership of the Republican Party."

 POLITICS_MAURICE_TOBIN_DESC:0 "Born in Boston, Massachusetts, on May 22, 1901 - Tobin's Catholic and Irish heritage has led him to become deeply popular among Boston's Irish population. He briefly worked at Conway Leather and New England Telephone after graduating from Boston University until he entered politics as a protege of the esteemed Democrat James Michael Curley. At just the young age of 25, Tobin was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives, which he served from 1925-1929. A fiscally conservative man, Tobin then became mayor of Boston serving the city without authorising large public scale projects. His career as mayor was rocked by the Coconut Grove fire, but the scandal did not stop the ambitious Tobin from running for President. An energetic and vigorous member of the Democratic Party, Tobin became elected as the 34th President, securing for the Democrats four more years in the White House. The nation waits to see what the new President will do, especially those involved in labour as Tobin has been a constant supporter of labour unions and socially liberal policies.\n\nServing alongside Tobin is James Farley, an Irish-Catholic New Yorker and member of the Knights of Malta. A fierce fighter for civil rights, especially for African-Americans, Farley has announced he will supervise the rebuilding of the nation's postal service and significantly improve its airmail capabilities. The two men have vowed to reunite and rebuild America once and for all under the leadership of the Democratic Party."

 POLITICS_WILLIAM_HARRIMAN_DESC:0 "Born in New York City on November 15, 1891 - William Harriman, also known as \"Averell\" Harriman, was born into a life of wealth as his father was railroad baron E.H. Harriman. During his academic career at Groton School and Yale University, Harriman made contacts that led to the large firm \"Brown Brothers Harriman & Co.\" During the 1930s, Harriman's properties grew to include the Union Pacific Railroad, the Merchant Shipbuilding Corporation, and the Polaroid Corporation. His immense wealth painted Harriman as an enemy in the eyes of the Syndicalists during the years leading up to the civil war. During the ensuing chaos, Harriman fled north for the Provisional Government of New England, where he joined the Committee of Canadian-American Relations and helped coordinate the joint war effort between New England and Canada. Through this position, Harriman gained the experience necessary to become the American ambassador to Canada - helping aid in the close relations between the two nations.\n\nReceiving the nomination of the Democratic Party and following his victory in the 1948 election, Harriman has become the 35th President of the United States of America. The new President has a lot of work cut out for him as the full signs of recovery are beginning to show, and the years of reconstruction are finally coming to an end. Serving alongside Harriman will be the former governor of New York state, Herbert H. Lehman. A supporter of the Second Square Deal during the provisional government era, Lehman has publicly stated his support for the guaranteed rights and wages of the working class."

 POLITICS_GEORGE_AIKEN_DESC:0 "Born in Dummerston, Vermont, on August 20th, 1892 - Aiken developed a strong interest in agriculture early, a passion that he would carry on in his career as governor of Vermont. A Republican, he ran unsuccessfully for the Vermont House of Representatives in 1922, but he ran successfully in 1930 and 1932. He ascended to the position of Lieutenant Governor in 1934 and became governor in 1936, just as the nation descended into chaos. As governor of Vermont during the civil war, Aiken helped organise work projects to alleviate the economic stress caused by years of the great depression. A proponent of spending projects for rural America, Aiken holds great affection for the natural beauty of his home state, although these views put him at odds with old-guard Republicans. With his background in agriculture, he portrayed himself as the defender of farmers and the common folk - with this stance and popularity, he accepted the Republican nomination for the campaign of 1948.\n\nNow the 35th President of the United States, Aiken faces a nation finally shaking off the dust after years of economic woe and instability. Serving alongside Aiken is Robert Bradford, the Republican Lt. Governor of Boston, and a man from a long-time traditional New England family. During his time as governor, Bradford emphasised fiscal conservatism but social liberal values as seen in his project such as housing and care for civil war veterans."

 POLITICS_THOMAS_DEWEY_DESC:0 "Born in Owosso, Michigan, on March 24, 1902 - Thomas E. Dewey attended the University of Michigan, where he briefly contemplated a career in singing. After a throat ailment convinced him a job in such was risky, Dewey instead pursued law which brought him to New York City. First serving as a federal prosecutor, Dewey achieved headlines in the 1930s by prosecuting gangster Waxey Gordon. With an excellent memory, Dewey used his details of crimes and telephone taps to bring down criminal organisations. Unfortunately for Dewey, however, the great civil war forced him to flee from New York City and head north to New England, where he would serve as governor in 1942, 1946, and 1950. Regarded as an honest and effective governor, Dewey banned racial discrimination in employment and increased state aid for education and salaries for state employees. His Postwar "Reconstruction Fund" helped the city of New York recover after years of brutal civil war that had utterly devastated the metropolis, and with such fame, he achieved the Republican nomination in 1952.\n\nSecuring the election of 1952, Dewey is now the 36th President of the United States and leads a mighty America, years of civil war and instability long behind her. Serving alongside him is the grandson of the legendary American oil baron John Rockefeller, Nelson Rockefeller. A noted art collector, businessman, and politician, Rockefeller has been noted for his liberal and progressive views despite his Republican background."

 POLITICS_CHARLES_BOWLES_DESC:0 "Born in Springfield, Massachusetts, on April 5th, 1901 - Bowles came from a Republican family who hated and feared big government. However, Bowles' political views were shaped by his aunt Ruth Standish Baldwin, a socialist and friend of Norman Thomas. After graduating from Yale University, Bowles became an advertising executive, although he was forced to flee from New York City due to the arrival of the civil war. Initially opposed to Canada's involvement in American politics, Bowles joined the America First Committee, although he voiced his support for New England after the provisional government entered the fray. After the civil war, Bowles led the Office of Economic Stabilisation, using his years in economics to help rebuild the nation's war-torn economy. In 1948, he became governor of Connecticut, defeating James C. Shannon signed the end of segregated national guard units and acts to improve mental health and housing.\n\nNow the 36th President of the United States, after securing the election of 1952, Bowles plans to lead a new America, one willing to help develop the world's weaker nations. Realising America's restored industrial and military might be better used to serve the world, Bowles will push for greater American world involvement to keep the peace. Paul Dever, the governor of Massachusetts and a former Lt. Commander in the Civil War, will be serving alongside Bowles. The youngest ever Attorney General of Massachusetts, Dever's governorship saw mental health reforms and efforts to resist domestic syndicalism."

 newengland.17.d:0 "Faith and religion have long been keystone ideas in New England. While some questioned whether or not that would remain true as the nation descended into chaos with the outbreak of the second civil war - it appears that even in times of crisis, the New England faith remains as true as ever! After years of construction, the second largest church in New England was finally dedicated to the great happiness and satisfaction of Lewiston's French-Canadian population.\n\nDuring the mid 19th century, Lewiston experienced an influx of French-Canadians who came to work at the local textile mills. These Catholic migrants desired a place for worship, and for a time, the parishioners worshipped in the basement of St. Joseph's Church. Because of the large number of French-speaking parishioners, the weekly mass was moved to the nave of St. John's in 1872. But the number of parishioners simply outgrew the nave, and thus the construction for a new church began with the cornerstone of St. Peter's set in 1872. In 1881, the Dominican Fathers of Lille, France, and Quebec took over the administration of the church, and by 1889, the parish was known as S. Pierre S. Paul de Lewiston, Maine. By 1905, the parishioners numbered 10,000, and the splitting of the parish from 1907 and 1923 led to further delays on the project. Serious work on the project resumed in 1933 despite the ongoing Great Depression, and finally, it was completed in July of 1936.\n\nIts completion finished, now the church has finally been dedicated by the Diocese of Portland. The church's two organs, both made by Casavant Frères, a Canadian organ building company in Quebec, were also dedicated this year. Not only does the completion of the church reaffirm New England's traditional values of piety and religious freedom, but it also reflects the growing ties of the French-Canadians to their adoptive country."

# Sit Down Strikes
 newengland.18.t:0 "Supreme Court strikes down Labour case"
 newengland.18.d:0 "The right to free speech has always been a pillar of American democracy. While strikes and protests characterised much of the early 1930s, the government hardly cracked down on these acts of disobedience unless they grew violent. One of the techniques utilized by strikers would be the \"sit-down strike,\" a form of civil disobedience in which workers seized their workplaces by \"sitting down\" at their work stations.\n\nNonetheless, in a groundbreaking case made by the Supreme Court; the government of New England has ruled that participants of sit-down strikes could be fired and defeated a decision made by the National Labor Relations Board that declared that sit-down strikers could be reinstated. At the General Electric Plant in Schenectady, workers attempted to form a union. The company sent a labour spy into the union as the union began to clamor for a renegotiated contract. The company's continued refusal to compromise with the union led to the frustrated union to organise a sit down strike - shutting down a portion of the plant. After multiple attempts, police who were called to eject the strikers were finally successful. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ordered the company to reinstate the fired strikers, arguing that the company's actions before the strike were illegal. The case was brought to the attention of Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes who ruled that \"sit-down strikes\" were \"good cause\" for discharging the workers and the NLRB did not have the authority to force the company to rehire the strikers. While it is not explicitly stated that sit-down strikes are illegal, the court's decision and wording implies that sit-down striking has been effectively subdued within New England."

The New Englander philanthropist and businessman Stephen Carlton Clark is a great fan of the sport and aims to honour those who have shown excellence worthy of memorial. A native of Coopersville in New York, Clark was pained to see the city struggle throughout the Great Depression and sought to increase the town's revenues by upgrading its cultural institutions. Designed to be a future pantheon of all baseball heroes, old and new - the hall had its most recent inductees, the class of 1936. In this roster are Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth, Honus Wagner, Christy Mathewson, and Walter Johnson.

The earthquake lacked the destruction and size of the infamous 1906 one in San Francisco, but there were still damages to fix following its arrival. There were reports of fractured pipes, walls, and furniture, as well as fallen plaster near the epicentre. The earthquake caused damage to wells, turning the water brown, and even caused monuments in cemeteries to shift and an old house to move nearly 12 inches. Response teams were sent quickly to assess the damage, and thankfully the damages have proven to be just waves of minor damage."

With morale relatively low within the army, the Young Women's Christian Association president, Mary Shotwell Ingraham, has pushed President [NEE.GetLeader] to fund the creation of morale and recreational service for New England military personnel.\n\nWith the president's approval, multiple non-profit organisations combined to form the United Service Organisation. Churches, barns, railroad cars, museums, and even log cabins became recreational centres where GIs could rest and socialise. These establishments provided service members with a place to relax, have a dance, view films, and of course, a hungry GI could not deny the free coffee and doughnuts. The USO has been known for bringing concerts and events close to the frontlines to provide battle-weary troops with hope and encouragement in the desperate war to reunite the nation. Famous Hollywood refugees like Bette Davis and Spencer Tracey have joined the growing cast of current stars in the media to help the war effort by performing for the soldiers in the trenches. The USO has also seen a more significant influx of women volunteers - to provide a nostalgic hour for the weary soldier so he can talk and meet with the girl from back home in person. For many of these men, the girls they meet at USO events remind them of whom they are fighting for - bringing back to mind their loved ones and their sisters and friends they left behind to fight for American freedom."

Eager to aid young readers to enlist- Simon and Kirby brought their comic book creation \"Captain America\" into the hands of young Americans who quickly became infatuated with the patriotic character.\n\nMany eager recruits found resonance with the Captain's origins, as ordinary Steve Rodgers, who, despite his meager size, felt compelled to try again and again to enlist in the war against the radicals and revolutionaries that threatened America. At the encouragement of a scientist, Rodgers takes a super-serum in an experiment that dramatically enhances his physical abilities and size, transforming him into a near-perfect rendition of the human form. As "Captain America," Rodgers and his sidekick Bucky Barnes fight enemies of America such as the Syndicalists' Red Skull as well as the demagogues of Mac Arthur and Huey Long, who have been portrayed in the comics as warmongers intent on destroying all aspects of American life. While some have complained that Simon's character has been overly political, Simon himself has admitted that his character was a consciously political creation and that he and Kirby found themselves repulsed at the actions of the Silvershirts and the Red Guards. Captain America has found fans with many young Americans with nearly a million copies in circulation, reminding them that New England's government stands for the true America. With his ever-present vibranium shield adorned with the stars and stripes, \"Cap\" reminds the Yankee young reader that even the little frail boy from Brooklyn could become America's most outstanding soldier."

Suddenly, the plane began to spiral out of control, diving nose first into a lake on the west shore. Concerned citizens rushed to the wreck but to no avail, the lone occupant of the plane had been killed in what appeared to have been an accident.\n\nThe pilot was Willie McKnight, a 23 year old pilot for the RWIF. Born in Edmonton, Willie was known for his notorious rebellious streak, proving to teachers that despite his athletic prowess - he was known for causing trouble. His cockiness persisting into University, McKnight signed up for the RCAF to partake in the retaking of the Home Isles by the Entente government. His aircraft in combat bore a distinctive human skeleton image carrying a sickle in its hands under the cockpit, on both sides of the aircraft - a memento mori for all his opponents but perhaps even an ironic joke at his syndicalist enemies.

Carrying 500 passengers from Hoboken, New Jersey, the train left Binghamton, New York, 30 minutes behind schedule while the freight train was traveling from Elmira to Mount Morris. The freight train had backed into a siding to allow the passenger train to pass, but then it moved back onto the mainline while switching cars. The freight train had ignored a stop signal and had moved onto the track of the passenger train. At 17:22 p.m, the passenger train sideswiped the freight train's engine and derailed with the locomotive of the freight train scraping the sides of several cars. The resulting impact tore open the side of the car, and boiler steam from the freight engine filled into the coach.\n\nMany people found themselves frantically trapped in the coach, and some could escape by breaking windows. All but one of the 29 fatalities were caused by internal or external scalding of the boiler steam. Thanks to the rapid response by a local sheriff, first responders were able to deploy rapidly to the scene, including firemen and the medical services. Many of the passengers on the train were army servicemen, and thus they formed a little police unit to keep spectators and onlookers away until sufficient policemen had arrived. Around 114 people were injured, with nearly 56 requiring hospitalisation. An official inquiry from the Interstate Commerce Commission and the New York Public Service Commission declared the incident to have been an accident, although the DL and W railroad had to install derailing devices as an added safety measure."

The men at Kodak argue that due to its size and shape, the grenade would be perfect for our servicemen - as any young American man should be able to properly throw a grenade with accuracy and distance.\n\nWeighing at 12 ounces, the T-13 grenade is designed with a pressure trigger and in-flight arming device. It was intended to be literally thrown like a baseball, and it could be held with two fingers on its weighted \"butterfly cap.\" Once in the air, the cap would detach from the grenade, and a nylon string would unwind until a secondary arming pin attached is pulled - allowing the grenade to detonate upon impact. While the Kodak Corporation has praised the grenade as the future of the American infantrymen, our initial trials have proven to be disastrous, with more sudden accidents than successes.

The principal provider of his family, Carlson often turned to his own interests in inventing; he was heavily inspired by the success story of Thomas Edison. To Carlson, the idea of invention is alluring as it could provide an escape from his meager social status. Carlson attended the California Institute of Technology, a hard-working young man, where the school's tuition placed him further in debt. With the height of the Great Depression hitting the states in 1930, Carlson found himself out of work and out of money.\n\nIn 1936, Carlson began to study law at the New York Law School in Tribeca amidst the chaos that engulfed the American nation. Spending long nights at the New York Public Library, he grew tired of copying law books by hand due to his inability to afford them. This seemingly endless task led him to read an article in an obscure German scientific journal from Pál Selényi regarding the nature of copying machines. He conducted experiments after experiments in his tiny apartment - often smoky and smelly and sometimes even explosive. Despite developing arthritis of the spine, Carlson persisted - working with an Austrian immigrant, Otto Kornei. Finally, on October 22, 1938, the men achieved their breakthrough Kornei wrote: \"10-.22.-38 ASTORIA\" in ink on a slide which then had an electrical current generated and then transferred onto wax paper. In the hands of the two men was the world's first xerographic copy. While Carlson has already filed for a patent, it remains unknown whether or not businesses will approach Carlson for his invention.

The book is a rhythmic children's story featuring a child's fanciful imagination while strolling through Mulberry Street (perhaps inspired by the actual Mulberry Street in Springfield, Massachusetts) while colourful and expressive illustrations dot each page.\n\nWriting under the moniker \"Dr. Seuss\", the author is Theodore Geisel, a 33-year-old New Englander of German descent with nearly ten years of writing and illustrating experience. Geisel attended Dartmouth College, where he rose to the editor-in-chief of the humour magazine \"Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern.\" Geisel continued his education by attending Oxford University in the Union of Britain to achieve his Ph.D. in English literature, where he met his future wife, Helen Palmer. Leaving Oxford in 1927 without finishing his degree, Geisel began to submit drawings and illustrations to make a living - achieving breakthrough success with a commercial piece for Filt, a bug spray. In 1936, after returning from a European voyage, Geisel felt inspired by the rhythmic sounds of the ship's engines which encouraged him to develop the rhyme scheme that makes up his latest book.\n\nFleeing New York City, as one of many American refugees - Geisel has returned home to his native New England in the hopes of escaping the tragic plight shared by many in the former United States. According to Geisel, the frustration of being consistently rejected led him to nearly burn his manuscript of Mulberry Street until he ran into an old Dartmouth classmate.

Shunned by his classmates and suspended at boarding school, Harvey is sent on a European excursion with his father to fall overboard in the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. He is then fatefully rescued by a Portuguese-American sailor, Manuel Fidello (played by the handsome Spencer Tracy), and taken aboard a Massachusetts schooner. Onboard the "We're Here," Harvey finds that his status as the son of a wealthy New York socialite means nothing, and despite his spoiled acts, the boy is still offered a temporary crew ship until the boat returns to the States. He befriends the captain's son Dan (played by Mickey Rooney), and he grows closer to Manuel, with Manuel becoming an almost surrogate father for the young boy. In the movie's climax, the schooner races against a rival vessel when Manuel climbs to the top of the ship's mast. The mast cracks, and Manuel is plunged into the icy sea, much to the horror and sadness of Harvey. Returning to the States, Harvey is reunited with his father, who is in awe of his son's growth in maturity over the past months. They offer a solemn moment of remembrance at the Fisherman's Memorial in Gloucester, Massachusetts, with bouquets and wreaths - the closing shot being the memorial and a smiling Manuel.\n\nCritics have praised the movie for acknowledging the naturally formed bonds made at sea and the tribulations the waves have to offer. For many, it is indeed a reflection of the times with New England's position in the great American Civil War and a reminder of the natural New Englander spirit to continue on despite the hardships."

 newengland.33.d:0 "Since May of 1936, the AFL has been helping a union in the towns of Tonawanda, Ilion, and Syracuse strike against the Remington Rand company. Inspired by the syndicalist strikes across the rust belts, the workers reached the pinnacle of their anger when the company began spreading rumors that they would be bought by a firm that would not recognize the union. After the union threatened a strike, the company distributed its own strike ballots, which led to anger as union members seized and destroyed company ballots while also intimidating managers.\n\nSpurred on by the radical rhetoric of Jack Reed and his SPA, the union members became increasingly violent as the protests escalated. Local police and private security forces were called up by Remington Rand on numerous occasions to break up the strikers. As the frustration of the strikers grew, so did their tactics. Emboldened by Red Guard militias, strikers had begun to create homemade bombs and hurl large iron balls at the police. Blood has been shed, as some of the strikers have even been shot by the police.\n\nWith no compromise in view, an obvious choice would be to send in the National Guard. Putting down the strikers and regaining the police force's discipline would ensure that this rabble would finally be dealt with. However, some stress that this may only fuel more tensions among our workers. The Syndicalists are right on our border, and they will no doubt capitalize on this strike to further paralyse our nation. Instead, they suggest that we approach the strikers in negotiation - this will also help us earn the trust of the striking workers."

 newengland.34.t:0 "Fallout of the Remington Rand Strike"
 newengland.34.d:0 "The initial arrival of the first of the National Guardsmen alarmed the strikers. The protestors who had been growing more daring in the past weeks of striking began to hurl not just insults but projectiles at the National Guardsmen. Nobody knows who fired the first shot, but the strikers and Guardsmen were drawn into a chaotic swirl of violence and rage, leading to scores being injured.\n\nReinforcements of National Guardsmen had arrived in Tonawanda, Ilion, and Syracuse at the request of the state governor. Severely outnumbered, the strikers began to disperse, but the guardsmen began arresting strikers en masse, placing strike leaders in chains. The response from the National Guard was surprisingly effective. Faced with the strength of the military, the strikers agreed to end their strike, but serious concerns have been raised towards President [NEE.GetLeader]. The strikers will undoubtedly use this act as an excuse to garner support from the Syndicalist elements in Chicago. The governor has faced criticism from the press and the state of New York for the repression, with many claiming the use of the national guard was a precursor to tyranny."
 newengland.34.a:0 "They left us no choice."

 #Negotiate:
 newengland.35.t:0 "The Strikers Appeased"
 newengland.35.d:0 "After days of tiring and tense negotiation with both sides threatening to leave at least once, the strikers of the Remington Rand plant have agreed to the talks offered by the company. The strikers were appeased, and their rights to unionize were officially granted by Rand. Many of the strikers who had been arrested during the strikes were rehired.\n\nWhile many nationwide are hailing this as a success among the working classes, the strike's victory has worried some. If workers continue to be radicalized and organise deadly strikes that cripple the already exhausted economy, who knows how long before New England falls to the syndicalist menace. While the factories are reopening and the strikers finally return to work, many in the government wonder if New England will be safe from the tide of revolution."

# Shoe Strike
 newengland.36.t:0 "The Shoe Strike"
 newengland.36.d:0 "Perhaps emboldened by the civil war that has torn apart our nation, workers in the shoe industry in the cities of Lewiston and Auburn took to striking. These strikers, many of whom come from French-Canadian descent, began demanding higher wages, conditions, shorter workweek, and union representation, with the number of the protests growing to the thousands. Shortly after the strikes began, the manufacturers offered a 10% wage increase to fulfill the strikers' demand - but these offers were quickly put down.\n\nWith the protests growing increasingly violent and with no signs of the strikers backing down, President [NEE.GetLeader] has requested that the governor of Maine deal with the situation at hand. The governor can call in the National Guard, which may involve further altercation and outright violence, although the protests will definitely be quieted. Alternatively, the governor can negotiate with the strikers although this would be a serious loss of face for the New England government to handle its own people."

 #Crack Down:
 newengland.37.t:0 "Crackdown on the Shoe Strike"
 newengland.37.d:0 "With the approval of the Governor, the National Guard had been called to deal with the persisting strikers. Workers and union organisers attempted to march in solidarity across South Bridge in Lewiston, numbering in the thousands. Many of the protestors were women, eager to stand up for their working rights.\n\nThe National Guard and police immediately got to work in the fights with the strikers, and the strikers soon found themselves fleeing the scene. The Lewiston Evening Journal described the event as simply "Red Wednesday" due to the violence of the incident. Strike organisers such as Powers Hapgood were immediately arrested and sentenced to short-terms, and for nights, the guardsmen patrolled Lewiston and Auburn. While the President congratulated the governor for his initiative in subduing the unrest, the civil unrest, especially among Maine's French-Canadian population, has only grown in response to the harsh crackdown."
 newengland.37.a:0 "We gave them a chance."

 #Negotiate:
 newengland.38.t:0 "Negotiations with the Strikers"
 newengland.38.d:0 "Listening to the words of his advisors, the governor agreed to enter talks with the strikers. While the strikers were adamant in receiving their wage increases, workweek, and improved conditions - the governor was also persistent in ensuring that the unions would be administered by the textile companies. Finally the strikers agreed to be supervised by company unions at the cost of having the rest of their demands fulfilled. The Lewiston Evening Journal summed the negotiations up as a much needed relief in these uncertain times.\n\nNonetheless, the governor's negotiation with the strikers has led to doubts as to whether or not he is capable of leading the state of Maine. Many in the nation do see syndicalism as an ever present threat and surely pleasing the workers would only encourage their radical ideas to spread further. Criticism from Democrats in Maine have been aimed at the governor's seemingly soft stance claiming it as a \"surrender to syndicalism.\""

As comrade shoots comrade and the battlelines shift in both directions, one can not forget the tremendous loss of civilian life.\n\nOften caught in the midst of battle, decimated in bombing raids or executed by fanatics of either side, these people have been fleeing en-masse from the fighting towards our nation. As the land route is becoming more dangerous by the day, vast swathes of shaky tubs have been spotted on Lake Erie in a desperate attempt to reach our peaceful sanctuary. The condition of these rafts is often so dire that many don't even make it across the border, let alone into our safe hands. Relief organisations such as United America and the Red Cross have flocked to the coastline of the lake to help those that survive the perilous journey, often undertaken under cover of the night. They now ask that the government provides them with more means to rescue those coming across and to sweep our side of the lake for survivors.\n\nPragmatists in the Army however have seen an opportunity in this Great Migration to smuggle weaponry and equipment from the CSA into our hands. They propose that we send covert agents to Detroit and Cleveland who will then smuggle the goods on the refugee rafts towards our patrol boats."

Even heavier equipment such as artillery shells and dismantled mortars have been carried across by efforts of our, American, people being nothing short of heroic. Thus far the Syndies suspect nothing but it would seem only natural that one day our luck will run out..."

 newengland.53.t:0 "Smugglers Apprehended!"
 newengland.53.d:0 "Our good fortune couldn't last and yesterday was once again further proof of this. Although nothing seemed out of the ordinary on the smuggler boats, a slight deviation on the schedule of the Cleveland harbour patrol caught our operatives in the midst of the crime. Words could not explain why there were dozens of ammo chests and carbines on an unmarked vessel and it didn't take long until the boat was brought back to shore and our agents locked behind bars."

A happy story however emerged from Connecticut where a young Doberman, ironically enough named Jack, was able to stop militia agents from blowing up a bomb in Hartford.\n\nThe dog was training in cooperation with the Connecticut National Guard when his patrol spotted the agents who promptly tried to escape from capture. With the courage of a true American, the little dog immediately ran after them and pulled one of the two men down leading to his capture. This man later turned out to be none other than Paul Rashford, a target long sought after by the Hartford Police Department for his implication in the riots only a few months earlier and who seems to have established a whole network of operatives in Connecticut.\n\nWhilst his capture by no means marks the end of the socialist threat in the state, 'Jack' has dealt a heavy blow to their leadership."

Border guards are unable to keep up with the increasing amount of refugees and government institutions and relief organisations are struggling to provide shelter and food to those who have lost their home. We need to step in and do so now or we will risk our own nation collapsing under the weight of these people who more often than not have used all their resources to make it to our border.\n\nA hard choice will have to be made between restricting the amount of refugees coming and thus leaving them at the mercy of Pelley’s regime in the South or to let them all freely cross the border and risk straining our own nation. Relief organisations like United America have already denounced certain political figures who have spoken out against the unchecked migration but even they are now realising that resources are rapidly decreasing, and the flood keeps increasing."

Visited by GIs, movie stars, celebrities, and even politicians such as Maurice Tobin - the nightclub also has been rumored to have links with the Mafia and organised crime. Initially a garage and a warehouse, the club offered its patrons dining and dancing in a "South Seas" like a tropical paradise with support columns made to look like palm trees and fixtures made to look like coconuts.\n\nAt 10:15 pm on the evening of November 28th, however, a young soldier removed a lightbulb in the lounge to give himself and his date some privacy. A young busboy was called to replace the lightbulb; unable to find the bulb, he lit a match, tightened the bulb, and extinguished the match. Witnesses would report that soon after, flames burst from palm fronds beneath the ceiling. Despite the best efforts of the staff, the fire simply spread throughout the nightclub, racing faster than patrons could move and covering the entire establishment with smoke. The building's main entrance was a single revolving door which became useless as the patrons panic. By the time firefighters had arrived, 492 lives were lost. Perhaps more grotesque was that some bodies were discovered with drinks still in their hands as the fire and toxic smoke had overtaken them too quickly.\n\nThe owner of the club Barney Welansky was convicted on nineteen counts of manslaughter due to his failure to follow the city's loose restrictions. Welansky was missing on the night of the fire due to a heart attack, but he has been known to have boasted of his relationships with Mayor Maurice Tobin and the Mafia. Investigators also discovered that the club lacked licenses for serving liquor and food, and the remodeling was done by unlicensed contractors.

Nearly 100 feet of ice came crashing down on the bridge's abutments, ultimately compromising the structure. Not even the 24 feet tall fortifications added in 1899 after an ice bridge threatened to push the bridge over could prevent the collapse. Luckily the cold temperatures deterred most visitors to the falls, and thus, no one was injured.\n\nThe Northeastern states are currently experiencing one of the severest cold waves of winter. Sub-zero winds followed by a harsh blizzard have swept southwards from Canada, bringing New England to a two-year record for frigid weather.

In 1930, Wakefield and her husband Kenneth Donald Wakefield bought a tourist lodge in Whitman in Plymouth County. A junction located halfway between Boston and New Bedford, it was a place where passengers traditionally paid tolls, changed horses, and ate home-cooked meals. Ruth cooked and served all the food at the inn, gaining a cult following of fans who enjoyed her lobster dinners and desserts. But indeed, it is her cookie that has earned her national fame.\n\nNicknamed the \"chocolate chip cookie\", Wakefield claimed that she added chopped bits from a Nestle semi-sweet chocolate bar into a cookie. While reporters incorrectly stated the move was a mistake, Ruth claims that she intentionally sought to create a cookie with a delicious bite of chocolate. The cookie has reached soldiers stationed in Massachusetts, many of whom have written letters requesting it from their families while at the frontlines. The nation then became infatuated with the cookie with Wakefield agreeing to give Nestle the rights to the Toll House cookie name for one dollar and a lifetime's supply of Nestle.

The film is a telling and dramatic piece of New England's upper society and has come when societal tensions are at an all-time high. In particular, the film's themes of mortality and all-star cast have proven to be reasons for the movie's success at the cinema.\n\nSet in New York City, Judith \"Judy\" Traherne (played by Bette Davis) is a young and carefree hedonistic Long Island socialite and heiress with a passion for all things expensive and vices such as smoking and drinking. Despite her outgoing lifestyle, she begins to experience headaches and blurred vision, and after multiple incidents, she visits a doctor at her friend Anne King's recommendation. She meets Dr. Frederick Steele (played by Irishman George Brent) who is reluctant to aid the antagonistic Judy, but upon a further inspection, Steele realizes that Judy is even beginning to experience short-term memory loss. In a surgical operation, Steele realizes that Judy has a malignant glioma brain tumor that cannot be removed and that Judy will die within a year but not before she experiences total blindness. To give her false hope, Steele lies to Judy and Anne to allow her to live with happiness. Although Anne discovers the truth, she agrees to keep it a secret. As time passes, Steele and Judy become romantically involved, but eventually, Judy finds out Steele's diagnosis by accident. The two experience a short break in which Judy reverts to her old habits. After a conversation with her stablemaster, Judy decides that she will go out with dignity and returns to Steele, where the two move to Vermont. The film concludes with an ending that leaves audiences in tears as Steele heads off to present a potential cure for Judy's cancer while Judy finally becomes fully blind. The final dialogue between Steele and Judy has been praised by the people of New England for its reassuring tone in the time of national crisis. Calm and composed at the end, in contrast to her actions in the earlier parts of the film, Judy lies motionless on her bed as the screen fades to black."

Bad intel on our part ultimately led to disaster as the entire group of planes was shredded to pieces with only Private Bob and one of his crew mates surviving the crash. Landing deep behind enemy lines and with no way to reach our own positions, the two men took it upon themselves to perform a series of guerrilla actions in the region, achieving critical success in hindering enemy supply lines and successfully forcing their command to deploy further troops to the region.\n\nTheir success would however not continue much longer as an attempt to recruit possible sympathisers amidst the civilian population backfired and a setup orchestrated to finally kill the two men led to the death of Bob's fellow soldier and the loss of his right ear.\n\nNow alone, out of ammunition and still with no way to return to base, Bob travelled all the way North to Lake Erie whilst always staying one step ahead of the enemy agents tracking him down.\n\nEmbarking with 50 refugees on a shaky vessel, Bob finally made it back into New York last week. Having been stuck alone with no contact deep behind enemy lines, it took the brave man 50 days to make his way back into our country leaving a trail of sabotage in his wake.

While the American air force remained untested throughout the 20th century, bombings and air raids have become increasingly frequent as the war continues.\n\nIn a determined effort to break the Steel Belt's [395.controller.GetAdjective] stronghold and gain control of the skies above Chicago, the Army Air Force has authorised the initiation of \"Operation Pointblank.\" This would shift our bombing tactics from targeting \"precision\" targets in the day to actively targeting [395.controller.GetAdjective] air strength. New England bombers have been instructed to target aircraft factories to weaken and cripple the [395.controller.GetAdjective] war effort while also harassing the morale of their civilians. By targeting aircraft factories, the Army Air Force hopes to draw out the [395.controller.GetAdjective] fighters into action - hoping that we will drain their air strength in a protracted war of attrition. The initial bombing strikes have been reported to have been successful, with many targets successfully struck and plenty of [395.controller.GetAdjective] aircraft shot down."
 newengland.76.d.defender:0 "While bombings and air raid sirens have become increasingly frequent ever since the outbreak of hostilities, the New England government has begun an intensified period of bombing recently. They have escalated daylight bombing of our aircraft industries, perhaps in a bid to cripple our power in the air.

We'll focus on defending our industries so that we will be able to strike back in time!"

 newengland.77.t:0 "Government Rifle Contracts"
 newengland.77.d:0 "As the Provisional Government of New England finds itself on the doorstep of war, the question has been raised by businesses and the army as to which company the government will align itself with. To reclaim the rest of the nation means that New England infantrymen will have to be equipped with the most modern rifles - the old dusty national guard rifles hastily handed out will not do. Two names for an officially sponsored government contract have been consistent throughout the endless debates - the Springfield Armory and the Winchester Repeating Arms Company.\n\nScouted and approved by George Washington himself in 1777, the Springfield Armory is an obvious candidate. Briefly, the only government manufacturer of arms during the first American Civil War, choosing the Springfield Armory carries a symbolic resonance, especially as New England claims itself to be the last bastion of American democracy on the continent. An industrial powerhouse responsible for mass producing and developing the M1903 rifle, the Springfield Armory also features a curious new weapon designed by New Englander John Garand. Garand has been developing a semi-automatic rifle since 1919, and although many of his designs have failed to meet the army's specifications, his latest design, the \"M1, caliber 30,\" has shown to be extremely promising in initial tests. With the M1 in plans to be fully adopted within our armed forces, perhaps we should consider supporting the Springfield Armory.\n\nThe Winchester Repeating Arms Company has also been brought up in discussion. Founded in 1866, the company is responsible for the successful \"Model 1873\" known as the \"Gun that Won the West,\" named as such for its iconic use on the Great Plains. Since its early days, the Winchester Company has continuously released self-loading rifles in the many years of its operation. While the Great Depression had severely weakened the company, company vice president John M. Olin pushed a new company tradition of producing only the finest and well-crafted deluxe rifles and shotguns. Since its hard times, the company has bounced back, and their craftsmanship would surely come in handy for our uses. If Winchester secures the government contract, our soldiers will have their hands on sturdy and durable rifles."

 newengland.78.d:0 "With the shifting catastrophe of the Second American civil war raging on our southern border, the training regimine of our troops was halved down to 4 weeks to accommodate the limited number of instructors available. Such a shift was effective in getting more men through completion of the program but came at a cost. Comparing the results of the pre-war class to the hastily recruited 37ers, shows a vast disparity. Individual marksmenship fell by as much as 31% during the hasty training period.\n\nAccordingly, the syllabus for the Marine training course temporarily ran out of New London, Connecticut has been restored to a full 7 week length. Additional specialisation and training are to take place before new recruits are to be placed in with their units. While this will prevent quick mobilisation of the troops, our forces must be in peak condition to properly defend the home of the American Revolution!"

While some in the military command were initially sceptical, Dole suggested that perhaps it would be best to make \"soldiers out of skiers instead of skiers out of soldiers.\"\n\nThanks to the lobbying efforts of Dole, the Army has begun a campaign to enlist and recruit soldiers for the 10th Light Infantry. Formed at Fort Drum in northern New York, the 10th Light Infantry has been designated as a mountain warfare unit - intended to help breakthrough enemy defenses in treacherous terrain and weather. Situated in the freezing Adirondack mountains, the men of the 10th have undergone rigorous mountain and arctic warfare training. They are also instructed to scout and map out mountainous trails and terrain as the nation finds itself gripped with fears of infiltration and sabotage With sub-zero temperatures for nearly half a year, the hazardous and perilous conditions formed bonds of camaraderie among the tightly knit and disciplined group."

Across the border, both sides look upon each other in mutual enmity and regret, knowing that friends, families, sisters, and brothers are separated due to the civil war.\n\nHowever, our soldiers on the border were awakened uncharacteristically in the dead of night by an alarm raised by one of our patrols. A battalion from the 1st New York National Guard managed to spot a group of spies from [CSA.GetNameDef] attempting to travel along the Genesse River. A brief skirmish unfolded, leaving several dead and wounded on both sides before elements of the raiding party were able to sneak back across the syndicate border. The skirmish was not entirely unsuccessful; we managed to capture a few prisoners from the raid. It appears that they were just one of many such groups that are now working to infiltrate and perform subversive activities across western New York.

For weeks, our military and intelligence agency has been observing the movement of the Reds across the border. Nonetheless, we have been able to stay ahead of the CSA's machinations, and our preparedness shows in our response.\n\nUpon news of syndicalist partisans attempting to seize control of local arsenals and administrative centres, the New York National Guard was rapidly deployed to put down the uprisings. In anticipation of a seditious uprising, our armed reserves have been training and practicing for the inevitable. The Reds found themselves hopelessly outmatched and outnumbered as National Guard units and squads could put down the armed rebels with their superior firepower. Those traitors who did surrender were immediately apprehended and hauled off to ensure that they would no longer pose a threat. Due to our preparation in advance, we were also able to evacuate many civilians from harm's way safely. The border has been considerably strengthened, and we will take further steps to ensure that the Reds will not be as bold next time!"

The army was forced to dispatch a swift relief force in order to relieve the areas under rebellion but by then the damage had been done. While we were able to put down the uprising, parts of Rochester and Buffalo lie in ruins with local infrastructure torn to shreds in the ensuing fighting.

Despite the international community's neutrality to the events in the United States, the Canadian Army crossed the American border in the opening days of the war. To many New Englanders, the Canadian intervention in those chaotic early days gave hope that America's northern neighbour was eager to protect democracy in the New World.\n\nHowever, it appears that is no longer the case. Perhaps in a desperate bid to muster men for the hopeful return of the British Exiles, the Canadian government's enactment of full conscription infuriated the Quebecois leading to mass protests and riots across the country. In a move unsurprising to demagogues such as MacArthur, the Canadian government's implementation of the War Measures Act has brought what many regarded as the last stable democracy of North America to its knees in face of authoritarianism. With Canada's commitment to democracy a liability, President [NEE.GetLeader] has consulted his cabinet regarding a potential alliance between the Provisional Government of New England and the Pacific States of America.

 newengland.150.d:0 "Located at 17 Piedmont Street in the Bay Village neighbourhood of Boston, a few blocks south of the Boston Public Garden, the Coconut Grove is well known among Bostonians as a popular hangout spot given the number of celebrities that frequent it. Visited by GIs, movie stars, celebrities, and even politicians such as Maurice Tobin - the nightclub also has been rumored to have links with the Mafia and organised crime. Initially a garage and a warehouse, the club offered its patrons dining and dancing in a \"South Seas\" like a tropical paradise with support columns made to look like palm trees and fixtures made to look like coconuts.\n\nAt 10:15 pm on the evening of November 28th however, a young soldier removed a lightbulb in the lounge to give himself and his date some privacy. A young busboy was called to replace the lightbulb, unable to find the bulb he lit a match, tightened the bulb, and extinguished the match. Witnesses would report that soon after, flames burst from palm fronds beneath the ceiling. Despite the best efforts of the staff, the flames simply spread throughout the nightclub, racing faster than patrons could move and covering the entire establishment with smoke. The building's main entrance was a single revolting door which became useless as the patrons stampeded in panic. By the time firefighters had arrived, 492 lives were lost. Perhaps more grotesque was the fact that some bodies were discovered with drinks still in their hands as the fire and toxic smoke had overtaken them too quickly.\n\nThe owner of the club Barney Welansky was convicted on nineteen counts of manslaughter due to his failure in following the loose restrictions of the city. Investigators also discovered that the club lacked licenses for serving liquor and food and the remodeling was done by unlicensed contractors. The mayor of Boston, Maurice Tobin has come under fire for his connections to Welansky with some calling for his resignation."

New Hampshire's jurisdiction begins with the original low water line on the west bank of the river. For nearly 150 years, the two states had been arguing where the line ran. Both states collected taxes from property owners, and there was a recurrent debate between the states as to which state would control the bridges and control powerhouses.\n\nA.F. Hassen, chief of the cartographic section of the Geological Survey, said that some map changes in the past twenty years have been significant enough to change in the geographic text but obscure enough to mostly only affect scientists, road builders, and engineers. Most of these changes happened as a result of rivers changing course. Following the fixture of the Vermont-New Hampshire border, the Geological Survey began to look for other erratic rivers that may have changed course and, therefore, could drastically change the boundary lines."

The bespectacled and short visitor greeted Grew with a bow, and to the surprise of onlookers, Grew returned the favor. Grew then invited the guest and his entourage into his home, where it is reported that the men shared a delicious drink of tea.\n\nThe visitor is Prince Tokugawa Iesato, the first head of the Tokugawa Clan after the overthrow of the Tokugawa Bakufu and the ensuing Meiji Restoration. A youth in England gave Iesato the respect of the Entente Powers - during the Weltkrieg, Iesato had organised a condolence booklet in concern for the enormous death and destruction in Europe. Despite the tense relations between Japan and the United States, Iesato and Grew had come to treat each other as close friends and sought to encourage goodwill between the two nations. In recognition of Japan's gift of cherry blossom trees in 1912, Iesato had travelled to New England in a goodwill event despite the great civil war that now divides the United States.\n\nWhile their conversation was limited to only those who were present, there are rumors that the two men discussed the ongoing situation in the Pacific. For a long time, the United States had competed with Japan for domination of the great ocean. Now with the civil war plaguing the United States, the Japanese stand virtually unopposed in the Pacific. Even if Iesato himself is committed to peace, the Japanese nation certainly has ambitions in Asia - ambitions that it will now feel comfortable to pursue without the industrial giant of America present. While no open conflict has yet emerged between the two countries, only time will tell whether or not peace will reign in Asia."

 newengland.153.d:0 "It is revealed to the public that administration leaders in the New England Congress received a surprise when a new possible war referendum was brought to the debate. The bill proposes that a national referendum should be held before Congress can declare war, thus giving the ordinary men and women the chance to have a direct vote on their country's involvement in foreign conflicts. However, in the case where the nation is attacked first, a referendum would not be held.\n\nThe controversial bill has secured the 23 votes needed to bring the bill into the House. Many Irish-American delegates are eager to support the bill, believing that this will give New England the ability to stay away from aiding the former British Empire. These delegates and the people they represent are wary of the British, with the memories of the Great Famine and the War for Independence still fresh in their minds. Nonetheless, with the decision of 35 congress members in the balance, congressman James Farley rallied his fellow Irish-American congressmen to shut down the bill. Farley believes that America's place in the world is to help it and not to stay away from the world's affairs. His efforts have been successful; the possible war referendum act has been shut down.\n\nInterestingly enough, a parliamentary question was raised late tonight by the discovery that the list of signers bore the name of William P. Connery Jr, a representative from Massachusetts who had died by the time the petition was being presented. The rule requires that a discharge petition be signed by a majority of the membership of the House. But the law says nothing about the signature of a dead member and the question remains for now unanswered."

 newengland.155.d:0 "Today, a shift in the foreign departments as Ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy Sr, ambassador to the Canadian government, has effectively been recalled and replaced with John Winant.\n\nThe recall happened after Mr. Kennedy gave a long and rambling interview regarding New England's commitments to the Entente with newspaper journalist Louis M. Lyons of the Boston Globe. In the ensuing speech, former Ambassador Kennedy unambiguously and repeatedly stated his belief that the war to liberate the Home Isles was not about saving democracy from the tide of Syndicalism.\n\n\"It's all a question of what we do for the next six months. The whole reason for aiding Canada is to give us time...as long as she is in there, we have time to prepare. It isn't that she's fighting for democracy. That's the bunk. She's fighting to restore the monarchy over the subjects who rejected her. I know more about the European situation than anybody else, and it's up to me to see that the country gets it.\"\n\nMr. Kennedy's words attracted nothing more than outrage from the President of New England and the Canadian government. The President has replaced Kennedy with John Winant, the former governor of New Hampshire. In his first official statement as the new ambassador to the Dominion of Canada, Winant has declared that \"We the people of New England are determined to help by action to ensure total victory over socialist aggression.\" Perhaps signalling a period of increased American and Canadian ties, Winant stressed that between the Canadians and Americans exist \"a bond of common sympathy and understanding, common purpose and devotion which will live on long after Syndicalist tyranny.\""

 newengland.157.d:0 "From a sickbed in the North County Community Hospital, where he is recuperating from a throat infection, Secretary of Commerce Harry L. Hopkins has again answered "definitely no" to allegations that he belongs to the Socialist Party of America. In the days following Hopkins' implementation of Work Progress Administration relief programs, Hopkins has come under fire within elements in Congress, with some denouncing him as a syndicalist disguised in sheep's clothing.\n\nIn a speech to the House, Democratic representative John J. Connor from New York State declared that the \"head of one of our great departments is a registered socialist.\" When Connor was asked whether or not he referred to Hopkins, Connor shrugged his shoulders and replied that \"one must draw their conclusions.\" While Hopkins and his son have reiterated orally that Hopkins does not belong to the Socialist Party, this particular incident has illustrated the paranoia among congress members regarding the so-called \"Red Menace\". Those who are fiscally conservative are wary of the increasing role of the government in the economy and have come to see socialism as the nation's greatest enemy, both politically and morally. Even in the workplace, there are reports that those suspected of having leftist leaning beliefs or those speaking favorably of Reed's movement in Chicago are being fired and discredited. Throughout New England, many in private are referring to this mass hysteria as a \"Red Scare,\" and some even jokingly remark that it is \"better to be dead than red.\""

# Hopkins WPA
 newengland.158.t:0 "The Work Progress Administration Under Hopkins"
 newengland.158.d:0 "In response to the continued economic woes from the Great Depression, Secretary of Commerce Harry L. Hopkins has announced an additional wage increase for workers in Work Progress Administration (WPA) agreements for workers in the rural areas of Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. The program now sets the new wage at $3.90 a month to more than 82,000 workers.\n\nIn the rural areas of New England, Hopkins argues that the wage earners there are only 45 per cent of the national average but with this new increase they will be getting 53 per cent of that average. This gives the impression of comparative underpayment in the North on the WPA. Nonetheless, opposing congressmen who are opposed to government intervention in the economy, find Hopkins' legislation too radical. Critics find themselves uncertain as to whether or not Hopkins' wage increase will actually benefit the rural farmer, especially since WPA wages can be determined by a single person. To quell doubt among the working class and politicians, Hopkins has helped organise the Community Mobilisation for Human Needs - an organisation dedicated to sharing the costs of relief between local, state, and federal governments."

While Snell has pledged that this \"will eliminate unnecessary reserve funds,\" he has also promised that this revision would be done \"without weakening the benefits of the Act.\"\n\nEstablished as part of the Second Square Deal, the Social Security Act issued direct payments to the elderly who were struggling with the woes of the Great Depression. The program was later expanded to include an unemployment insurance system and a national healthcare program - assisting those hit hardest by the economic problems of the late 30s. Nonetheless, with the Great Depression a distant memory, Congress' rollback of some of the provisions of Social Security has attracted controversy among some citizens who still find themselves reliant on the system. According to Snell, the Amendment is designed to prevent \"wasteful and disruptive discord between employer, employee, and labour organisations.\" Snell believes that the revision will help limit government competition with private enterprises so that businesses might create jobs with some certainty as to the future. While time will tell whether or not Snell's prediction will come true, the move has undoubtedly sparked anger among the working-classes of America."

 newengland.163.d:0 "An American entrepreneur, economist, business theorist - Secretary of Commerce Roger Babson has promoted establishing his so-called \"National Church Association Inc,\" a volunteer network where persons of any faith will have space to pause and worship.\n\nRepresenting the tenth generation of New Englanders, Babson heavily researched his ancestors - finding himself to come from a lineage of farmers, merchants, midwives, and sea captains. Holding the belief that traits are hereditary, Babson hopes to emulate the lives of his ancestors in his words and actions. After studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in engineering and a brief stint working on Massachusetts highway projects, Babson turned to a career of work as an investment banker. From there, his career expanded into economics advising, a brilliant financial forecaster keen on helping young and upcoming investors - Babson earned the distinction of being the first financial forecaster to predict the German economic collapse on Black Monday.\n\nSurviving what seemed to be an inescapable diagnosis of tuberculosis, Babson credits his recovery to his unshakeable faith. According to the Secretary of Commerce himself, Babson's most profound experience was his religious conversion at fifteen. From 1936 to 1938, Babson served as National Church Moderator for the General Council on the Congregational Christian Churches. During his tenure, he employed his fondness for statistics to showcase the church's weakness in attendance - fearing that a decline in church attendance would lead to a decay in society's morals. His appeals to chart a morally correct course for church and society were met with threats and defiance - ultimately ending his tenure as a moderator in disappointment.\n\nNevertheless, Babson refuses to give up. Now, as Secretary of Commerce, he has charted the course to open church doors for every day and hour. Babson's churches will be opened to peoples of all faiths so that all will have the space to express praise and worship to their most high. The opening of the first such establishment in Wellesley, MA, will be the first of many national churches for all Americans to practice their religions freely."

 newengland.164.d:0 "Having entered the world of politics, Babson and his supporters have pushed for a morally conservative society. Babson himself has long belonged to the Prohibition Party and has expressed his great desire to see America return to its \"moral past.\"\n\nRepresenting the Prohibition Party, Babson's party members believe in outlawing gambling, alcohol, narcotics, pornography, and other indecent publications. The party has also expressed its desire to pass legislation to conserve natural resources, reduce debt and taxation, aid farmers, and assure workers and consumers of industry's products and profits. As the new Secretary of Commerce, Babson has used his platform to denounce America's "decaying moral order" and petition the American people to return to the churches.\n\nWhile the total prohibition on the vices may not be a reality any time soon, Babson's party has undoubtedly achieved a victory with new legislation promising to help small rural farmers. These farmers will receive government stimulus and will have their taxation reduced to help them prosper. Babson himself has acknowledged that his party's size prevents it from becoming as relevant as the Democrats and the Republicans, but he has declared that he hopes that the people of America will take notice of his movement."

Just two and a half weeks after his 47th birthday, the ambassador passed away with complications from surgery for phlebitis.\n\nBorn on January 7th, 1896, in Rye, New York - Moffat was a lineal descendant of the famed John Jay, the first Chief Justice and a negotiator at the Treaty of Paris that ended the Revolutionary War. A professional diplomat, Moffat served as private secretary to the US Ambassador to the Netherlands from 1917 to 1919 and as secretary of the American Legation in Warsaw from 1919 until 1921 and in Tokyo from 1921 to 1923. From 1925 to 1927, he served President McAdoo as a ceremony officer, and at the end of his assignment, he married Lila Cabot Grew, the daughter of American diplomat Joseph C. Grew.\n\nSince 1940, Moffat has served as the ambassador to Canada - bridging the differences between the American and Canadian governments. In his obituary, the New York Times laments \"that even in war, when death is knocking at such a multitude of doors, the loss of a trusted public man in the flower of his ages and his powers is lamentable.\" His funeral in Christ Church Cathedral was attended by the Canadian Prime Minister and other Canadian officials.

Ever since the first American Civil War, tariffs in the United States have been at an all-time high. In response to the decades-long Great Depression and Black Monday, tariffs in the United States and the nation embraced a trade policy of protectionism. The Reciprocal Tariff Act aims to bring down these barriers, bring down duties on foreign products, and encourage trade between nations.\n\nBefore establishing the Reciprocal Tariff Act, if Congress wanted to enact a lower tariff - it would be unliterary and tackle the foreign country's tariff rate as fixed. Congress would choose a tariff rate that was either a little lower or higher than the median preferred tariff, depending on the composition of Congress. Individual members of Congress were under tremendous pressure from lobbyists to raise tariffs to protect them from the adverse effects of imports. The Reciprocal Tariff Act now ties US tariff reductions to foreign tariff reductions, giving Congress the ability to approve the tariffs with a simple majority instead of a two-thirds majority. With the President given the authority to negotiate the terms, we will undoubtedly see a more liberal trade policy in the near future."

He denounced the totalitarian regimes across the Atlantic that hold the peoples of Europe in bondage. Their society is highly materialistic, atheistic and unconcerned by the concept of a moral law. Instead they claim that laws are merely the means whereby those in power carry out their will. God-given unalienable rights are a foreign concept to them where every protection that a man can have can be stripped away by the government's will.\n\nWhile some good has been done for the proletariat in the nations overseas, this was only made possible through the coercion, terrorism, and liquidisation of those whose reason or conscience compelled them to resist the changing regime. There are some similarities in the professed end goals of both the Socialist States of Europe and America, yet, the methods employed are utterly dissimilar.\n\nThe Totalitarian regimes in Europe are not wholly a government of peace and liberation, as much as they wish to tell the world through their propaganda machine. It may not, and it is my hope that it does not wish for international war. Such devastation in the modern age would be completely unthinkable. Even if this is the case, the peoples of [NEE.GetNameDef] must remain ever vigilant against the prospects of foreign agents infiltrating the country to stir up the seeds of class warfare amongst the free citizens of the West."

In recent years, however, a new wave of immigration from French Canada to the mill-towns of central Maine has disrupted the homogeneity and tranquility of the state. With a growing community of devout Catholics in the state, the entrenched protestant majority increasingly turned to charismatic magician turned Ku Klux Klan Leader F. Eugene Farnsworth, who developed a deep web of Klan patronage and community which threatened to subsume the ruling Republican Party.\n\nThese tensions would come to a head in 1926, when a clique of pro-Klan Republicans led by Governor Owen Brewster were soundly defeated by the old guard of the party, which joined forces with their Democratic enemies to secure the election of an anti-Klan senator. In the wake of this electoral defeat, the Maine Klan suffered a number of legal and monetary setbacks, leading to a near universal collapse. While the Klan itself has all but dissolved, a more insidious legacy remains. A number of sheriffs and municipal administrators across the state were put in place by the Klan more than a decade ago, and continue to maintain Klan values in much of the state.\n\nAs far as official membership goes, on the other hand, all that remains are the Women of the Klan, who continue to fund a collection of local chapters through bake sales and church meetings."

Two months later, Edson went on his own ski race and fractured his ribs and arms while also suffering from lung collapse. The severe injury led to Edson's unfortunate death - and would have a lasting impression on Dole.\n\nThe president of the National Ski Association, Roger Langley, asked Dole to chair a ski accident study for the NSA and set up patrols for the 1938 National Downhill and Slalom Races. The success of this little project convinced Langley to ask Dole to charter a provisional patrol on a national basis throughout the United States. Dole took heavy inspiration from the Parsenndienst, a Swiss patrol in Davos, Switzerland, forming his own ski patrol. However, unlike the Swiss patrol, members of the American patrol did not charge for rescue or care. His \"National Ski Patrol\" is centreed around the motto \"Service and Safety,\" with patrollers mandated to take extensive courses to fulfill Dole's requirements and standards for effective and efficient patrollers. Since the organisation is entirely voluntary, Dole created an awards program based on local and national levels. The awarding program covers various commendable skills and achievements such as leadership, first aid, skiing, mountaineering, and avalanche training."

Acheson mentioned that he had heard that the European peoples seeking assistance were not hard-working and were instead reliant on American support.\n\nTo these critics of American overseas aid, Acheson argued that Europeans were not lazy - pointing out the rise in pre-war production in France and Britain. Acheson further admonished that if [NEE.GetNameDef] failed or refused to help the governments of Western Europe restore order; the citizens of these countries can easily fall sway to the seductive lure of syndicalism and socialism once more. To Acheson, the continued relief shipments to the European free world reflected America's strong commitment to global democracy and freedom - a commitment it intends to keep."

 newengland.183.d:0 "The past history of the United States has shown the futility of taking the isolationist stance. Despite a quick colonial war at the turn of the century with the fading power of the Spanish Empire, the United States began a shift in foreign policy towards isolation. While this trend successfully kept our young men from dying needlessly in the fields of Flanders over a European scuffle, American global interests were devastated. The collapse of the Third French Republic was to be a quick showcase of the tremors that were to come in the next half decade. Five years later, when the British Empire collapsed and the stock exchange plummeted, America found itself in its darkest hour since the outbreak of hostilities in 1861. As the Germans pushed the Americans out of the greater European market, and with longstanding American allies falling to socialist revolts, the United States was forced to turn inwards in hopes of outlasting the storm. This isolationist stance saw a decreasing American presence abroad until finally the fires of the second American civil war consumed America once more.\n\nIn a speech given to the New York Times, Secretary of State Sumner Wells decried that \"Isolation, in its earlier form, as an issue, is I believe, dead.\" If America wishes to see prosperity in the world, they can not make it happen while staying inside their borders at home. America must take an active approach to seek out allies and expand their presence. The way to secure future peace is through action, not merely words. Only then can the world know the strength of Democracy that spent much of the last two decades fading away in face of Authoritarianism and Socialism."

Despite being utterly ruined, Washington D.C. is a powerful candidate. The return of a President to the White House and the Congresses held in the Capital would legitimize the Provisional Government of New England as the heirs to American democracy. On the other hand, the city of Boston also poses a powerful argument. The birthplace of the American Revolution and the temporary capital during the nation's darkest days, Boston has undoubtedly proved its worth as the nations' capital. And finally, there is the proposal that the nation's capital should be moved westward, to the middle of the country.

At the committee, many members of the MPA, such as John Wayne, have argued that radicals in the film industry have been inserting propaganda onto the silver screen to incite labour union violence, manipulate voting behavior, and raise money for Syndicalists worldwide. The committee believed that enough evidence existed and expressed concern about \"everyone in the movie industry who might be used as agents of a foreign power to destroy our country.\" Popular actor Ronald Reagan, president of the Screen Actors Guild, testified that a small clique within his union was using "syndicalist" like tactics to steer union policy.\n\nAs subpoenas have begun to fill the mailboxes of movie writers, directors, actors, and executives - the fear of censorship has strengthened the liberal front in Hollywood. In response, a group of anti-syndicalist liberals formed the Committee of the First Amendment, arguing that the investigations violated the Bill of Rights. The Committee of the First Amendment argued that the American film industry - through its patriotic political mobilisation - had defended democratic America in the media during the civil war.

In the absence of a responsible government, the local state governments have organised a vote to determine who shall lead as the provisional president of New England. In hopes of shoring up some of our legitimacy, the provisional president will only serve until 1940, when a normal election cycle will occur. The convention has come up with three options.\n\nThe Republican Party has put forward their candidate of Lewis Barrows, a longstanding Republican committeeman and just recently elected into the governorship of Maine in 1936. Running alongside him is Styles Bridges, the former governor and current senator for New Hampshire. While they have promised to work with Democrats to bring about social relief for those still suffering under the Great Depression, they remain committed to fighting what they view as excesses in unionisation and welfare subsidies.\n\nRunning against them for the Democratic Party is David Walsh, the former Governor of Massachusetts and current senator of the same state. While he has not been supportive of large government projects ever since his political defeat in 1924, the party has chosen his running mate accordingly. Prospective vice-president Theodore Green, recently elected Senator of Rhode Island, is a fervent defender of big government. He has already delivered speeches outlining plans to ensure relief reaches the people and enacting wage and rent reform to keep the bottom line up.\n\nFinally, in an unorthodox approach for an equally unusual election, moderates from both the Democratic and Republican Party have pushed forward the option of Joseph Martin Jr, a member of the House of Representatives for Massachusetts for over the last decade. He has agreed to have Joseph Ely as his running mate, which will mark the first time since John Adams and Thomas Jefferson's election in 1796 that members of opposing political parties will run together.

The First American Civil War would be the watershed event to resolve slavery amidst the endless debates held between the Democratic and Republican parties. During the Gilded Age of the late nineteenth century, lobbying activities intensified as lobbying groups became an increasingly prominent force in American politics. The division between American political groups and the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment, and the woes caused by the Great Depression led to the radicalisation of Congress in the 1930s. Congress became a battleground in the days before the Second American Civil War, with national unity rapidly disintegrating.\n\nThe 1940 Congress plans to rebuild the faith of Americans in the legislative branch of government. With the radicals gone from the halls of Congress, the party system is now restored to its antebellum days - a Congress once more divided between the Republican and Democratic Parties. Passing legislation from one of the two will undoubtedly strengthen their dominance in the government, and therefore, a balance must be held between the two parties to ensure national unity.

Arguing that the government should play a new interventionist role in New England's crippled economy, the second square deal aims to follow Roosevelt's original Square Deal from several decades ago. Hopkins has assembled a team of government officials to chart out a new plan dedicated to the conservation of natural resources, strengthening the control of corporations, and enhancing consumer production.

 newengland.217.d:0 "As the Industrial Revolution arrived in the United States, factory owners would hire young workers for various tasks. Especially in the textile mills that categorize much of New England, finding children in the factories has not been uncommon. Children tend to work in factories and mines as their small statures make it easy to handle machinery and navigate tight spaces. Since 1870, the number of children in the workforce increased, and now with New England attempting to rebuild its industry - that number has not stopped growing.\n\nNonetheless, the implementation of children in the workforce has attracted a substantial degree of controversy. Factory work is dangerous, and children find themselves exposed to the chemicals and machinery of the industrial workplace that often leads to horrible accidents or death. Activist groups such as the National Child Labor Committee (formed in 1904) have risen up in response to child labour, often publicising young people's lives and working conditions. The Syndicalist cause has also seen efforts to reduce the number of children in the workforce and instead create state compulsory education laws to keep children in schools rather than at work. With New England's industry beginning to recover, Congress has now brought the issue of child labour to its latest debate. While some argue that children are needed to help struggling families and help New England's industry compete with the rest of the American continent, many believe that the practice of child labour is inhumane. Instead, they have pushed Congress to provide compulsory universal education laws nationwide, following the age-old New England tradition of education. Doing so would significantly enhance our research and intellectual capacity as we create a new generation of scientists and researchers, although this would cost fewer hands in the factories."

While Congress is indeed wary of the totalitarian and pervasive radical nature of socialism, the latest Congressional debate brings the issue of wage and labour standards to the table.\n\nThis proposed new law aims to amend the labour agitation in the country while also keeping the populace far from the allure of syndicalism. Supported by individuals within the Bureau of Labour Standards and Congresswoman Mary T. Norton, the proposal plans to formally adopt an eight-hour workday, a forty-hour workweek, and a wage for overtime hours. The act declares that workers must be paid a minimum wage and that the overtime wage must be one-and-a-half times what workers would usually be paid. The act also aims to cover younger workers and declares that workers under eighteen are exempt from specific dangerous jobs. Critics of the proposed law argue that it is nothing more than syndicalism in sheep's clothing and that the law dramatically strengthens workers and unions who may use the act as motivation to demand more. On the other hand, proponents of the law are confident that the passage of such protection will guarantee worker loyalty - ensuring that the issue of labour rights is dealt with for the time being."

 newengland.219.t:0 "An Unpleasant Scandal "
 newengland.219.d:0 "\"SCANDAL\" bleeds the headline of every newspaper across the country, with reporters furiously surrounding the Walsh residence in the wake of a nationwide election scandal. Having served two terms as President of [NEE.GetNameDef], Walsh has been acclaimed among many as the savior of the Democratic Party following the civil war that tore the nation apart. Despite his roaring successes in successfully combating the Great Depression and ending years of woe for New Englanders, Walsh seeks a third presidential term - unheard of and completely breaking with American tradition. No president in American history has served a third term - with George Washington himself leaving office after two, setting what many consider to be a precedent. Among the critical voices of the opposition are even those within Walsh's party, men like James Farley.\n\nNevertheless, before Walsh's campaign can even take off, it would appear that it is destined for failure. On a particular evening, OSS spies were dispatched to a male brothel after being informed that syndicalist spies were hiding amongst the patrons. The OSS found not just the syndicalist spies but also an immensely embarrassed David Walsh. His reputation is utterly in shambles among not just his party but the entire nation; Walsh will no longer represent the Democratic Party. Instead, the Democrats have decided to replace Walsh with the esteemed Massachusetts politician Joseph P. Kennedy."

 newengland.220.t:0 "Yet Another Scandal"
 newengland.220.d:0 "With Kennedy replacing Walsh on the Democratic Party's ticket, it would appear that the Democratic party would bounce back. However, once again, another scandal rocks the Democratic ballot - one that could potentially shift the election heavily in favor of the Republicans. Such a loss will end the two terms of Democratic dominance in [NEE.GetNameDef] political scene.\n\nDocuments and witnesses report that Joseph P. Kennedy has been in league with the former mayor of Boston, James Curley. Due to their shared Irish-Catholic heritage, the two men are pretty close and often seen together within the Massachusetts political scene. It would appear that Joseph Kennedy has paid off Curley for political favors - no doubt in efforts to secure Democratic support for Kennedy's presidential run or perhaps to secure a spot in Congress for Kennedy's son, Joseph F. Kennedy. With Joseph P. Kennedy disgraced, the Democratic Party again has another scandal to deal with and no presidential candidate to contest the Republicans. They have hastily nominated Maurice Tobin to win over their voting base, although it appears that for now, the Republicans possess a tremendous advantage in winning the election of 1944."

Flynn, Thomas, Foster, and Browder...these names were read over and over in the courtrooms, with each verdict yielding either "Treason" or "Guilty" over and over. John "Jack" Silas Reed, the former first and only President of the Combined Syndicates of America, was brought out as well, although his lawyers argued fervently that he is currently unable to defend himself due to his ill health. Reed, they argued, was trying to protect the common working class of America. Indeed this has been a mighty rallying cry for the defenders of the former CSA, that the SPA was only fighting for the rights of the working class and hoping to alleviate years of economic depression. And yet, what can explain the countless acts of senseless violence committed by the Red Guard that led to refugees abandoning homes and families for asylum in New England? While some are passionately pleading for amnesty or light terms for members of the former CSA, some believe that these men and women were traitors in our nation's worst crisis.

Huey Long was not present, having fled the nation in the final days of the Civil War, and in his stead were scattered members of the America First Party, including Charles Coughlin, Charles Lindbergh, and George Mosley. While their lawyers argued passionately that these men fought to preserve true American democracy and to defend it from falling into radicalism and socialism, the acts of Huey Long and his cohort did nothing but drive our nation further into dissolution. Their leader was nothing more than a demagogue, and many in their ranks espouse racist rhetoric, words that do not belong in our country. In addition, these men fought for an impure form of democracy, and there are plenty of eye-witness reports of Minutemen organising lynching mobs.

Many have argued that the Pacific States fought for true American democracy as the nation crumbled around them. Already, the lawyers of Merriam, Gellatly, and Johnson are petitioning the jury to understand that the leaders of the Pacific States truly hoped to keep American democracy alive, and they did nothing more than defend the Constitution. Such arguments certainly have had their sway, but it cannot be denied that the Pacific States fought against us in the Civil War and that New England blood was shed fighting against them. Surely they must be punished for their rebellion and refusal to accept us as the remaining haven of American democracy. Their participation in the Civil War was ultimately treason, such treason that can not be so lightly addressed. The final decision rests with the jury."

This was because they witnessed the trial of the former United States of America; even the former President [USA.GetLeader] was forced to sit trial. The prosecution declared that the former president's inaction and surrender of power to demagogues such as Mac Arthur led to the national crisis that drove our nation to its Second Civil War. Their inability to combat the economic problem that left millions of Americans workless was added to their list of crimes. While the prosecution desires harsh penalties for the former leaders of the United States, some argued that they tried their best to help the nation from a nearly impossible situation. They have pleaded for amnesty in the hopes of what they see as an eventual reconciliation and forgiveness of the former regime. The final decision rests with the jury."

The prosecution went straight for the facts; there was no doubt about it - when confronted with a national crisis, MacArthur had executed a coup that challenged the very nature of American democracy. While he and his cohort claimed the mantle of the former United States of America, the prosecution argued that this was no more than a Military Junta that threw the ideas of the Constitution out of the window. MacArthur himself was nowhere to be seen, having fled the United States in exile after the defeat of his Federal Army. His representatives argued that the old and exhausted General wanted nothing more than to retire in peace. They claimed that the nation was headed towards a radical path that would throw the country into utter anarchy, and MacArthur simply attempted to restore order and preserve American democracy. While many call his actions tyrannical, there are certainly those who believe that MacArthur wanted nothing more than to see an end of radicalism in our country. While the rest of his military clique's fate will be decided in a later trial, the final decision rests with the jury."

The prosecution pointed out that the military of the former Federal government took steps that intentionally endangered the civilian population and that the lives of many New Englanders were lost due to the actions of the former Federal Army. In addition, members of the prosecution indicated that the judgment should also extend to those in the former United States Navy - the punishment for most of these men would be years behind bars. However, their lawyers have defended the generals and admirals of the former Federal Army by claiming that they only sought to uphold their Constitutional duty and that most were simply following orders. A passionate defense for the former General Eisenhower was made from our very own General Mark Clark. He argued that Eisenhower was genuinely faithful to the ideas of America and that he only fought for the federal government due to his loyalty to defend the American constitution. Advocates of amnesty have argued that their expertise and devotion to the American constitution would be helpful in the reconstruction. However, the prosecution has pointed out that Clark and Eisenhower have been long-time friends since their West Point days, and there is undoubtedly bias in that regard.

Their devotion to values and ideals of America were not put into question, but the prosecution pointed out that they opposed the legitimacy of New England during the Civil War and that plenty of New Englander blood was shed in subduing the western states. While the prosecution intends to assign sentences or force a permanent retirement on some generals of the Pacific States, some generals and admirals such as Marshall and Nimitz have expressed regret for serving on the wrong side during the war.

While some doubt if it is even feasible to bring power to remote areas, the cooperatives working with the Rural Electrification Act have switched to a 7200 volt distribution network to help the transition.

Their loud clamors and leaflets in the streets have turned into blatant protests, and ever since the bills' implementation, African-Americans have been voicing out constant reports of crimes directed towards them. Despite the efforts of the federal government to erode the poll taxes and grandfather clauses that plague the voting systems of the South, these state and county legislators have promised to their people that Jim Crow will persist.\n\nThese protests have also been supported by remnants of the Longist regime in Louisiana, such as William Rainich, who have outright refused to accept the government's anti-Jim Crow measures - denouncing them as bills made by \"carpetbaggers, scalawags, and the NAACP to integrate schools.\" One of the most prominent voices for segregation is Theodore Bilbo, a former Longist Senator and open member of the Ku Klux Klan. Denouncing Congress, Bilbo's controversial work Take Your Choice, Separation, or Mongrelisation has found fans within the radical elements of the South. With rhetoric screaming for self-defense and lynching to \"save the white race,\" the protests have only gotten violent, with many saying that it is a repeat of the Red Summer of 1936."

Federal law enforcement conducted a heavy act of suppression across the South, arresting many in white supremacist linked groups such as the Women's National Association for the Preservation of the White Race and the Ku Klux Klan. With much of their leadership behind bars and their organisations shattered, those who have opposed the bill have finally stopped their agitation. Denouncing segregation as \"a powerful venom that poisons the minds of many Americans,\" the President has officially declared that schools must integrate and segregated facilities must come to an end.\n\nThe NAACP and the foreign press have praised the President's actions who have commended President [NEE.GetLeader] for his strong stance against the protests.

While there is debate as to whether or not the legislation was actually successful, the Bureau effectively was abandoned in 1872.\n\nWith the conclusion of the Second American Civil War, Congress has decided to re-establish the Bureau, keeping the humanitarian spirit of its predecessor while also hoping to resolve the former's failures. The organisation has been officially renamed the \"Bureau of Refugees, Landless, and Orphaned\" - headed by none other than the native New Englander archbishop of Boston, Richard Cushing. A member of the NAACP and well known throughout Boston for his seemingly endless energy and desire for reform, Cushing has been noted for his extraordinary charisma that ties together Boston's Jewish, Catholic, and Protestant communities. In addition to economic and medical aid to those left stricken by the brutality of the Civil War, the newly Bureau also plans to provide land, education, and opportunity for those who lost everything. Not only will the Bureau help with rebuilding broken communities, but the Bureau will also aid in the large torrents of former refugees who fled to Canada and New England during the war. Many of these refugees lost their homes and possessions in the opening chaotic weeks of the war, and the Bureau hopes to compensate them for their properties. Cushing has announced his plans for repurposing former Longist and Syndicalist buildings to create schools, clinics, and new institutions to help heal the broken nation.

While nothing radical like the reforms promised by the leaders of [CSA.GetNameDef], it seems our efforts have borne fruit, with the unions seeing our government in a new light. In time, the industrious efforts of the American people will finally return, and the extreme views of Reed and his cohorts put to rest at all."

With the South and North being rebuilt bit by bit, the Amnesty Act will allow for the official pardon of all the soldiers who served in the rebellious factions during the civil war. Like its predecessor in the Amnesty Act of 1872, the new Amnesty Act clarifies that disqualifications in local office or politics for the former rebels have been removed, allowing the country to reunite once more. President [FROM.GetLeader] has officially signed the bill into law today and has directed district attorneys in charge of prosecutions of the former rebels to discontinue them. While the top leaders of the Combined Syndicates of America and the American Union State will still be put on trial, many of their former servicemen and lower-ranking officials have been granted the presidential pardon. From the Pacific to the Atlantic, the American colossus has begun to pick herself up after stumbling in the chaos of civil war. The memories and trauma of the war will not quickly fade, and the road to reconstruction will still be a difficult one. Nonetheless, the President has assured the nation through a radio address that the great ordeal has done nothing but made the United States stronger, and soon she will be ready to take her place among the world's nations once more."

# WW2 Factory Riot
 newengland.273.t:0 "Factory Protest turns into Violent Riot"
 newengland.273.d:0 "With its main building covering nearly eighty-two acres and over 30 city blocks, the Dodge Chicago Plant was at one time the largest building in the world. Designed by the so-called "architect of Detroit" Albert Kahn and his company, the Dodge Chicago Plant became a hotbed of radicalism during the civil war as it helped churn out weapons, equipment, and vehicles for the CSA war effort. Its innovative design featured an extensive network of tunnels to facilitate foot and supply traffic while also providing shelter from the air raids above.\n\nAfter the war, the factory was moved into government hands and its former labourers employed. These workers had enjoyed extremely liberal conditions and benefits during their so-called revolution. They began to agitate and complain when they saw the former working policies of the CSA repealed and their old managers replaced. What started as an initial protest turned into a deadly strike, frightening the factory owners who had flashbacks of the years before the civil war. They called in local policemen to disperse the strikers, but the strikers only grew in numbers, and soon, the confrontations grew violent, with the strikers seizing tools and crafting homemade weapons to drive out the police. The strikers then barricaded themselves in the giant plant, with the governor of Illinois deciding to use the National Guard to suppress the unrest once and for all. The National Guard had difficulty storming the strikers who used the vast tunnels to hide and harass the guardsmen. As the soldiers breached into the plant, the strikers grew violent making use of their weapons to inflict casualties on the guardsmen. Against the superior firepower and strength of the guardsmen, the strikers found themselves simply outgunned; mass arrests were made of the surviving strike organisers and agitators."

 newengland.274.d:0 "The bloodshed at the Dodge Plant did not go unanswered. Enraged at the casualties of 97 Guardsmen, the National Guard began a brutal suppression of workers all across the Steel Belt. The riot in Chicago had provoked similar outbursts of working-right-related risings, all of which became quickly suppressed. Harsh curfews were enforced on Steel Belt cities, and the region has effectively been placed on martial law, with frequent night patrols roaming the streets in search of disturbances. While the actions of the police and National Guardsmen have attracted controversy among some media outlets, the President has justified the military's intervention in the crisis, arguing that the National Guard only intends to prevent future provocation from radicals and reactionaries alike. As the Steel Belt burns in flames, the rest of America wonders how much longer must the blood be shed before peace and order are finally restored."

 newengland.275.d:0 "The pervasiveness of racism acts as a near norm in the Deep South, where decades of Black Codes and Jim Crow legislation have held African-Americans from advancing in society. Despite the efforts of Reconstruction, the South's resistance to black integration has only grown worse, with segregation at every lunch counter and even water fountains separated.\n\nAs Congress continues to pass laws to federally repeal Jim Crow legislation, their actions have attracted nothing but anger and rage among Southerners heavily resistant against change. Today, white mobs gathered in cities like Birmingham and Montgomery to protest integration and desegregation, with many proclaiming "Segregation Now, Segregation Tomorrow, Segregation Forever." Large numbers of Klansmen, cloaked in their familiar white robes and hoods, have been seen intimidating black families and churches throughout the South. As the South grows increasingly unsteady, the National Guard has been ordered to protect African-Americans fearful for their lives. Protest organisers and ringleaders have been arrested, although many can tell that the white unrest has not grown any weaker."

 newengland.276.d:0 "Across the nation, the country is gripped with fear and concern at the headlines of "Welcome to Bombingham." Birmingham, Alabama - the "Magic City" of the South and once renowned for its modern industrialisation is now associated with a wave of unprecedented terrorism.\n\nAs the South begins to desegregate and ringleaders of the resisting protestors are rounded up, the Ku Klux Klan has turned to their violent ways of terror. Following the end of the war and the nation's effort at desegregation, black families were encouraged to buy houses in formerly segregated white neighbourhoods. The Klan would make nighttime trips to these houses, firing shots and throwing bombs into black homes and, in some cases, even lighting one's door on fire. Due to the near relentless wave of violence, Center Street in Birmingham has been amusingly named by black residents as "Dynamite Hill," with many black residents remarking the violence is reminiscent of the bombing and shelling of the Civil War. The local police in Birmingham have been noted for being extraordinarily late, and their lack of patrolling has led the violence to go on without repercussions. As a result of the chaos, the National Guard has been sent to Birmingham, with guardsmen stationed throughout black neighbourhoods to deter the violence. Nonetheless, despite the terror, some brave black families have chosen to stay put - believing that their tolerance of the attacks will help speed up desegregation."

 newengland.278.d:0 "The continued destabilisation of the nation in recent days has led to great concern among the civilian population, many of whom are weary of the years of civil war. Violent strikes in the North and terror attacks in the South have become the norm as Longist and Syndicalist terrorists continue to fight their war despite their official surrender. With unrest in major American cities and states, Congress has officially repealed the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878.\n\nSigned by then-President Rutherford B. Hayes, the Act limited the power of the Federal Government in the use of federal military personnel to enforce domestic policies within the United States. The Act was designed to be passed in response to the Federal army occupation of the South during the twelve years of Reconstruction during the Civil War. In a sweeping form of legislation today, Congress has declared that the continued terrorism and violence of the remnant Syndicalist and Longist resistance movements must be crushed at all costs. The Act has officially been dissolved, giving the Federal Government the ability to use the military, airforce, and navy to enforce its will. With the Army's tanks and trucks on their way to the major cities of resistance like Birmingham and Chicago, civilians have already begun to voice their concerns as the nation descends into complete martial law."

 newengland.279.d:0 "The military's hand is now fully drawn following the repeal of the Posse Comitatus Act in a significant federal attempt to crush resistance; the army has now focused on a prominent centre of Syndicalist resistance in West Virginia. Coal Mining had flourished in West Virginia during the late 1800s, and by 1917, the coal mining industry accounted for nearly 89,348,000 tonnes of coal. A hotbed of Syndicalist radicalism, areas like Mingo County and the Little Coal River became havens of socialist resistance, with miners and partisans stocking up in ammunition and arms.\n\nThe foggy and misty Applachian mountains proved to be a defender's paradise. The miners had access to tunnels and paths that they knew best, striking National Guard units with impact and surprise. Days of sporadic skirmishing and brief encounters led to nothing more than the frustration of the National Guard, although the miners became increasingly outnumbered. Lt. General Thomas J.H. Trapnell and Thomas Francis Hickey planned a coordinated assault involving artillery and air coordination to wipe out the Syndicalist resistance. The Federal Army had intelligence from the air with planes spotting the pockets of resistance in the air, and thus the Federal troops began to shell the Syndicalist resistance to break and weaken the Syndicalist morale. Despite the intense bombardment, the Syndicalists offered considerable resistance, primarily due to their knowledge of the terrain and entrenched positions. Nearly 157 federal troopers would lose their lives in the ensuing operation. However, the Syndicalist efforts would prove futile as their casualties increased and their supplies grew increasingly limited. After a week of intermittent fighting, the last of the miners and partisans began to climb out of their hiding positions, turning in their arms to the federal government."

# Final Swamp Holdout cleared
 newengland.280.t:0 "Bogs cleared in New Orleans"
 newengland.280.d:0 "For weeks, the Klan and the American Union State remnants had holed themselves in swampy bayous such as the Bayou Corne sinkhole. Nestled among the alligators and the crawfish, these remnants from Long's tyrannical movement still continued to claim to fight for the "true America," and their resistance had become too strong for police and militia to handle.\n\nWith the military given full permission to subdue the last of the rebel resistance, the military command has begun to analyse the marshy terrain in the hopes of launching successful raids to wear down and eventually rid the region of the remaining traitors. Led by the West Point graduate Hamilton E. Howze, the army has decided to execute "Operation Eucalyptus," a coordinated strike of highly maneuverable units into the dense and deep Louisiana bayous. A fierce advocate for maneuver warfare and speed, Howze believed that the best way to crush the Longist resistance would be through repeated raids in an attempt to gradually weaken and demoralise the rebel remnants. After a week of enduring resistance, the cracks in the Longist defenses were beginning to show. Isolated from supplies and reinforcements, their forces were being thinned out with each rapid Federal raid. With the help of the New England dockyards, small, fast, and inexpensive patrol torpedo (PT) boats were brought out to help navigate and scout out the swamps. Following a week of continued fighting in the swamps, the last of the Klansman and Longists offered their unconditional surrender - ending the previous significant Union State efforts to oppose the federal government."

The major remnant rebel forces have been successfully subdued, with much of their leadership in chains and their weapons captured. As the nation finally begins to heal from the wounds of the great civil war, the military forces needed to maintain the country's occupation have slowly withdrawn. Checkpoints across the country are being taken down and the curfews lifted in many American cities.

Beached on a deserted island were a group of men and a canoe. Without resorting to headquarters and breaching protocol, the crew of U-99's Kapitänleutnant Otto Kretschmer immediately organised a party, including himself, to investigate. Upon reaching the island, they found that the men were American crewmen from a torpedo boat named PT-109 that had been destroyed in an attack by the Japanese. After ensuring the American crew was fed and clothed, Kretschmer immediately radioed his superiors to ensure they were sent home.\n\nThe commander of PT-109 was none other than the handsome son of the acclaimed New England congressman Joseph P. Kennedy. Lt. John F. Kennedy had been ordered to bring PT-109 to scout and survey Japanese naval movements near German Samoa. However, on a dark and moonless night, their ship was caught off guard and rammed suddenly by a Japanese destroyer - cutting the entire vessel in half. With the wreckage of a crew and two dead crew members, Kennedy gave his men the order to fight or surrender. The brave sailors chose to fight to the end and swam 3.5 miles away from the wreckage of their ship to find safety. The brave lieutenant swam through the water despite an injured back, towing a badly burned crewman with a life jacket strap clenched between his teeth. Kennedy made other mile-long swims to hail passing PT boats or search for supplies for his exhausted crew. He and his executive officer then made the long swim with their crew to a nearby island where they found edible coconuts but no freshwater. Thus, Kennedy and a crewmate made a one-hour swim to find supplies, where they found a canoe with drinkable water and food. Two days later, paddling back to his crewmates, they were discovered by and were rescued by U-99, much to their relief.\n\nLt. Kennedy has returned home a hero, although he has continued to thank Otto Kretschmer and the crew of U-99 for their hospitality. He has returned home, hailed as a hero, decorated with the Purple Heart and Silver Star Medal. With his natural charisma, many are wondering if he, too, will continue a career in politics like his father."

 newengland.400.d:0 "During the height of the Great Depression, the failure of former President Hoover's policies to alleviate the economic crisis led to the creation of \"Hoovervilles\" in Seattle, Washington. These desolate shanty towns that sprang up to house those who had become homeless due to the Depression reflected the American nation's lack of social safety. Following the victory of democracy in the Second American Civil War, President [NEE.GetLeader] and an entourage, including General Lemuel Shepherd, have arrived in Seattle to assess the damage done by the great civil war and encourage national unity.\n\nThe Emerald City had become a haven of socialist resistance and sentiment during the early 1900s. One of the largest state affiliates of the Socialist Party of America in the Western States of America, Washington boasted more than 62,000 paid members. When the civil war broke out and the Pacific States of America seceded, socialist demagogues like Anna Louise Strong helped lead the treacherous Seattle Commune in a seditious uprising against the Union. For days, anarchy and chaos plagued the streets as the city became yet another front in the great war. Pacific troops under General Alexander Vandegrift placed the city under siege, and after a week of heavy street-to-street fighting, the last of the remaining syndicalists surrendered. The orchestrators of the rebellion including Strong were tried and convicted by the Pacific court, all of them receiving imprisonment for their sedition.\n\nEven though the rebellion had been crushed in the early days of the war, the devastation caused by the ensuing battle could still be seen. President [NEE.GetLeader] gave a brief speech thanking the city of Seattle for its loyalty to American democracy and thanked them for their perseverance during the war despite the horrible conditions. [PSA.GetAdjective] General Vandegrift and New England General Shepherd were also present; both men were seen sharing a private talk, perhaps reminiscing their times together in the Marine Corps. The nation they had served in their youth that seemed to collapse had risen back on its feet once more."

In America's darkest hour, the Pacific States and New England fought side by side as not only Americans but brothers-in-arms.\n\nIn a radio address to the Provisional Government, President [PSA.GetLeader] praised the government in Boston for its speedy economic recovery amidst the Great Depression. He mentioned New England's tactfulness and strength in building up their industrial powerhouse before joining the fray. Above all, he thanked the men and women who helped build the weapons that would end up being sent to the Pacific States. The President's speech was met with praise and approval in newspapers all across New England. The fire that threatened to destroy the soul of the American nation had been quenched by the place where the American country had been born.

In San Francisco, a joint ceremony was held between the Armed Forces of New England and the Armed Forces of the Pacific States to mark the official integration of both armies. Representing the Pacific States would be General George Marshall and representing the Provisional Government would be General Mark Clark. Friends that had been split apart from the war and had found themselves fighting for the true America were able to embrace each other once more. No longer were they Irish Catholic militia or Nisei Japanese-American volunteers. They are now soldiers of the Armed Forces of the United States.\n\nThe President of [NEE.GetName], [NEE.GetLeader] praised the Pacific States for their early entry into the great civil war. Refusing to accept MacArthur's so-called \"Federal Government,\" they had joined the fight to preserve American democracy from the clutches of a military junta. As New England rebuilt and developed in isolation, the Pacific States fought alone. Like our forefathers did against King George, they had taken up arms against the odds - and against the odds, they succeeded.

The Provisional Government of New England was hastily formed in the spring of 1937 during the national crisis by the aid of the Canadian Government and the Entente. In America's darkest hours as thousands fled from the violence that consumed the country - New England was a bastion of freedom and democracy. New Englanders saw the Entente as the greatest rival towards radicalism and the Canadian government as the bearer of the torch of liberty in the Western Hemisphere. As America became torn apart in the civil war, the people of New England hoped that the nation would be reunited with the Entente's support once more.\n\nHowever, in a move that shocked the government of New England - the Canadian government fell to authoritarianism and the iron rule of the English king. They had cast away the shield of liberty and had become as autocratic as the very revolution that had driven the British into exile - for this [PSA.GetLeader] claimed America owed an unpayable debt.

A crowd gathered in anticipation of the much-awaited speech by the American diplomatic mission in front of the Beaux-Arts adorned embassy on 100 Wellington Street. While the building formerly served as the American legation, events on the rest of the continent have allowed the legation to transition into a full embassy.\n\n[NEE_Ambassador_name] began his speech thanking the Canadian people for its protection and commitment to democracy in the New World. He made it clear that should the United States ever be reunified and rebuilt to its pre-war strength, it would make a great effort to repay America's debt to the Canadian peoples. The speech was made with great appraise by all those present, and it was reported that the British King himself later paid a personal visit to the ambassador.

While it will take a while for America to heal and recover from the civil war that has torn the continent apart, the might of a restored United States will gladly support the goals and ambitions of the Entente. In return, the Canadian Prime Minister assured the ambassador that the free world of the Entente would stand behind the government of New England in America's darkest hour.

[NEE_Ambassador_name] thanked the soldiers of Canada directly, praising them for their brave commitment to restoring democracy to Europe and wishing them success on the eventual homecoming. He emphasised that the Canadian military's role in the intervention of 1937 was instrumental in protecting the people of New England from falling into the chaos and destruction that destroyed the American nation. Finally, he concluded that should the day ever come when Canada needed help, American soldiers would be more than willing to risk life and limb for the freedom of the Canadian and British peoples.

The company had gained all Ford patent rights and selling privileges to all parts of the former British Empire, excluding Great Britain and Ireland. The plant would see Canada's first car "the Model C" wheeled out, and the coming years would see continued production of vehicles for civilian and military use.\n\nTo strengthen American and Canadian business ties, [NEE_Ambassador_name] paid a visit to the Walkerville plant. Escorted by the owner of Ford Canada, the American ambassador was seen strolling through the steamy assembly line and conversing with the assemblers. In a brief speech to the workers, he praised their efficiency and remarked that aside from the United States, the work ethic of the Canadian worker was unparalleled. No wonder why Canada has been able to bounce back from years of economic depression and has turned itself into an industrial giant. The workers gave the ambassador a rambunctious round of applause, and as thanks for the American visit, Ford Canada pledged to send 80 of their Canadian Military Pattern (CMP) trucks in a gesture of goodwill."

A businessman and an engineer, Howe's business expanded into engineering consulting and general contracting, with his firm dominating the grain elevators of the Canadian West.\n\nThe two men discussed how to tighten the business and cordial ties between the two nations. Howe proposed a relatively undeveloped plot of land near Port Arthur, Ontario, that could serve as a building ground for a joint Canadian-American factory. The factory in Canadian lands would be staffed with Canadian and American workers, improving employment in both countries while allowing the two nations to reap the profits. It was also reported that upon meeting one another, both men talked for a long while about the situation in America and Canada's role in the intervention.

The forerunner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), the Northwest Mounted Police force enforced territorial acquisitions of Canada's westward expansion and served alongside forces of the British imperial forces internationally. The Mounted Police received their \"Royal\" title after service in the Second Boer War and merged with the Dominion Police to officially form the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. This new organisation is charged with federal law enforcement in all the provinces and territories of Canada as well as assuming the role of national counterintelligence. As part of its duties, the RCMP has infiltrated political or ethnic groups considered to be dangerous to Canada. In its recent years of operation, the RCMP, in particular, has had to deal with a large number of syndicalist sympathisers and spies that have smuggled their way across the Canadian-US border.\n\nDue to their expertise and experience with strikebreaking - the Government of [ROOT.NEE.GetNameDef] has petitioned the Canadian government for garrison and repression assistance as the armed forces of New England begin the national liberation.

For nearly a decade, America wallowed under the effects of the Great Depression, but Barrows has led our nation into prosperity! The Great Depression's worst effects are far behind her, thanks to the programs enacted by Barrows. Accordingly, Barrows has promised that his second term will be devoted to balancing the budget now that the Depression is fading while looking to rededicate those resources to better connect the rural regions.\n\nRunning against them, the Democratic camp is quick to call for an increased government. The Square Deal projects' effectiveness under Barrows is commendable, and those initiatives should continue. Charles Hurley and his running mate Peter Gerry have been touring the nation and speaking to those whose lives have been directly impacted by projects such as the Civilian Conservation Corps.

While his efforts to restore the budget and get America back on her feet came to success, it did not endear Baldwin with many voters. In his place, the Republican Party has chosen Thomas Dewey, the governor of New York. Dewey is a more amenable candidate for liberal Americans. He supported the Square Deal projects and is committed to retaining what few programs have remained since the Baldwin administration.\n\nRunning against Dewey for the Democrats is Chester Bowles, the current governor of Connecticut, and avid internationalist.

#NEE'S Army General Descriptions by Drozdovite#
###############################################

 NEE_LESLIE_GROVES_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L August 17, 1896, in Albany, New York State, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L Leslie Richard Groves Jr. was born in a family with quite a history in the military, considering his father had served in the Spanish-American War, the Philippines and the Boxer Rebellion. During his late high-school years, Groves started to enrol in courses at the University of Washington, hoping to get an appointment to the United States Military Academy. He got his wish when President Woodrow Wilson himself allowed him to compete for his vacancy, but his grades weren't high enough to be accepted. Instead, Groves joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the meantime while he prepared to retake West Point's entrance exam. In 1916, he took the entrance exam again, and was accepted, visiting the European battlefields on an educational tour in 1919 and graduating in 1920 as a second lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers, thanks to his experience in MIT. He was posted with the 4th Engineer corps stationed at Camp Lewis, and would later be moved to Fort Worden, where he'd meet his future wife, Grace Wilson. In late 1922, he was posted in Hawaii with the 3rd Engineer corps at the Schofield Barracks, where he earned a commendation for helping construct a trail from Kahuku to Pupukea. He would be assigned several times, becoming commander of Company D of the 1st Engineer Battalion, helping during the New England flood of 1927, being sent to Nicaragua in 1929 to conduct surveys for the construction of the Nicaragua Canal, and being assigned to look over Nicaragua's water supply after the 1931 earthquake. It was upon his return to a shattered United States that he gained his last promotions, rising to the rank of Field Marshall in New England, mainly due to the sheer lack of capable staff in the region.\n§YImportant Notes:§L- A brilliant engineer, he has been following closely the development of Nuclear Fission technology keeping regular contact with Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner."
 NEE_MERRITT_A_EDSON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L April 25, 1897, in Rutland, Vermont, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L Merritt Austin Edson joined the University of Vermont in 1915, and in June 1916 he joined the First Infantry Regiment of the Vermont National Guard, where he was sent to Eagle Pass, Texas to work in the Mexican Border. He'd return to Vermont in September, but some time after returning to his university he signed up for the Marine Corps Reserve. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps on October 1917, and would be promoted to first lieutenant in June 1920. He later signed up for the Naval Air Station Pensacola, and earned his gold wings as a naval aviator in 1922. He was later stationed in Guam, where he received training on semi-tropical environments and upon returning to the US in 1925, he'd take an advanced aviation tactics course at Kelly Field, Texas. He'd later be sent to Nicaragua to fight against the Sandinista forces, and would return to the United States by late 1929. He has since then become the Coach and captain of the Marine corps National Rifle and Pistol teams, managing to win both the 1935 and 1936 tournaments, despite several interruptions due to the growing social unrest. He was finally promoted to Major in February 1936, and assigned to Philadelphia. With the collapse of the Union into civil war, Merritt hardly managed to reach New England before armies closed down the border towards New England. His experience and fame have granted him an early promotion to the rank of Brigadier General.\n§YImportant Notes:§L- Apathetic to politics."
 NEE_MARK_CLARK_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L May 1, 1896, in Sackets Harbour, New York State, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L Mark Wayne Clark was born into a family with a great military history. His grandfather was George Rogers Clark, a military general from the times of the American Revolution, and is the cousin of Army General George Marshall. He joined the United States Military Academy at West Point when he was just 17, in 1913, but unfortunately lost time in his career due to his constant illness. In his time in West Point, he met and befriended Dwight Eisenhower, and Clark graduated in April 1917 alongside Matthew Ridgway and J. Lawton Collins as a second lieutenant. Like his grandfather, he chose to serve in the Infantry corps where he was assigned to the 11th Infantry Regiment. He'd later serve in a variety of staff and training roles, gaining the rank of First Lieutenant in 1921, the rank of Captain in 1925 after completing the professional officer course at the US Army Infantry School, and reached rank of Major in 1933 after being assigned as the training instructor of the Indiana Army National Guard. He served as the deputy commander of the Civilian Conservation Corps district in Omaha, Nebraska while doing courses at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School where he would meet old classmates like Matthew Ridgway once more, as well as meeting Walter Bedell Smith and Geoffrey Keyes, with whom he had a cordial relationship. As the internal situation deteriorated, Clark was on leave in New York, and when hostilities broke out, he moved to New England looking for safety. With the lack of capable staff, Clark has been hastily promoted to Brigadier General, where he'll now have to oversee the creation of a new army.\n§YImportant Notes:§L- While his loyalty is unquestioned, his friendship with now enemy Generals have raised concerns that General Clark will be unable to do his duty when the time comes to face them openly on the battlefield."
 NEE_GEORGE_KENNEY_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L August 6, 1889, in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada\n§YMilitary Career:§L George Churchill Kenney entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1907 where he followed a course in civil engineering. He never completed his studies, as his father abandoned his family and he was forced to work in order to sustain his family. He later enlisted as a flying cadet for the Aviation section of the US Signal Corps. He was commissioned as a first lieutenant in the 5th of November of 1917 and wouldn't be promoted until 1921 after taking a course at the Air Service Engineering School of Dayton, Ohio. He became Air Service Inspector of the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company. In 1926, Kenney became a student at the Air Corps Tactical School, at Langley Field, Virginia, where he became increasingly interested in the combined used of the air force and the army to coordinate deadly attacks. In September 1932, Kenney entered the Army War College in Washington D.C. where he joined one of several committees studying Weltkrieg battles, where he became an expert on the Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes, and began working on what came to be known as the War Plan Orange. He was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in March 1935, and was assigned to the Infantry School at Fort Benning, in Georgia. However, seeing the buildup to the civil war from the Longist South, Kenney was certain that hostilities were about to break out so he prepared an escape plane with a group of loyalists, and decided to escape northwards as soon as hostilities broke out. Despite all odds, the plane managed to reach New England unscathed, and Kenney has joined the New England General Staff to provide for their defence any way he cans."
 NEE_WILLARD_G_WYMAN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L March 21, 1898, in Augusta, Maine, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L Willard Gordon Wyman entered the United States Military Academy in 1917 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Coastal Artillery Branch, and later transferred to the Cavalry Branch of the United States Army. He became an infantry and cavalry instructor in 1921, and would gain valuable experience working as an attaché on China between 1928 and 1932, reaching the rank of Captain upon his return. The lack of capable staff forced an early promotion to Brigadier General for Wyman, but he has shown willingness to learn despite being thrown in such a difficult position."
 NEE_LEMUEL_SHEPHERD_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L February 10, 1896, in Norfolk, Virginia, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L Lemuel Cornick 'Lem' Shepherd Jr. graduated from the Virginia Military Institute in 1917, and would enter the Marine Corps right after as a second lieutenant. He'd slowly climbed his way to Captain in 1922, where he was assigned to the Marine Company that assisted the Brazil's Centennial Exposition and would be later reassigned to the Marine Detachment on the USS New York. In 1927, he was shipped to Tianjin to serve in the 3rd Marine Brigade guarding the American Legation in the city. Lemuel would return to America in 1929 and graduate from the Field Officers' Course in 1932. He'd be sent to Haiti to serve with the Garde d'Haïti as a District and Department Commander, where he earned his promotion to Major. In 1934, Shepherd was detailed to the Marine Barracks, Washington, D. C., as Executive Officer and as Registrar of the Marine Corps Institute and would be promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in early 1936. After his promotion, he was assigned to the Naval War College at Newport, Rhode Island. With the country spiralling into Civil War and the Canadian seizure of New England, Shepherd presented his services to the New England Government, earning his promotion to Brigadier General and being assigned to the New England Marine Corps, where his experience shall be greatly valued by the small New England staff."
 NEE_CORNELIUS_RYAN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L 12 May, 1896, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L Following high school,Cornelius E. Ryan attended the University of Connecticut where he was active in football and basketballs squads and reached the rank of first sergeant in the Reserve Officer Training Corps. From there, Ryan pursued a career in the United States military - entering the Company Officers' Course in September of 1922. With an avid interest in modern military technology, Ryan studied tanks at the Centre D' Etude des Chars de Combat in the Commune of France. When the civil war broke out, Ryan decided to remain in his home state of Massachusetts, hoping to aid the New England government's claim to legitimacy amidst the chaos. In his studies of European warfare, Ryan is heavily influenced by the concepts of vertical envelopment and believes that New England should invest in airborne training. With permission of the high command, Ryan began organising and searching for volunteers to join New England's first airborne forces."
 NEE_ERNEST_HARMON_ARMY_DESC:0 "Tragically orphaned at the age of ten, Ernest Harmon was raised by his relatives in Newbury, Vermont, and would spend much of his early life in the village of West Newbury. He attended Norwich University for a year before receiving an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1913. Prominent in school activities such as horse riding, hockey, football, and boxing - Harmon's time at West Point also drew him close to fellow graduate Mark W. Clark. In 1921, he was assigned to West Point as an instructor in mechanical drawing, and his additional duties included coaching for the football team and West Point's first lacrosse team. He would serve in the 6th Cavalry Regiment in Georgia and four years as a Professor of Military Science and Commandant of Cadets at Norwich. In 1933, he graduated from the United States Army Command and General Staff College, and in 1934, he became a graduate of the United States Army War College. When the civil war broke out in the spring of 1937, Harmon decided to stay with his close friend Mark W. Clark, and joined the Provisional Government of New England. His leadership experience and exemplary educational background will be pivotal in training the relatively inexperienced armed forces of New England."
