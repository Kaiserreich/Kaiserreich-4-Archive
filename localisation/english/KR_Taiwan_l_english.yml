### Events ###
 taiwan.1.t:0 "Union with Japan?"
 taiwan.1.d.china:0 "Our recent separation from Japan, bringing an end to over forty years of exchange and integration, has not only left us economically adrift, but also bearing difficult questions of identity. Have we truly been liberated? Or have we been stripped of our own mother country? Do we belong with China, or do we deserve to decide our own fate?\n\nDifferent people have different answers. Those in urban areas, a significant portion of the population, benefitted from decades of Japanese occupation. Many are themselves ethnically Japanese, and many more consider themselves culturally so. Others, particularly in rural areas, look to China for answers; countless generations spent on the periphery of China's empire cannot be ignored, no matter how distant that control may have been. Others still, a minority of intellectuals and representatives of the indigenous population, urge us to chart our own independent path.\n\nRecent events have created an opportunity to answer these questions once and for all. What will the people of Taiwan choose?"
 taiwan.1.d.nochina:0 "Our recent separation from Japan, bringing an end to over forty years of exchange and integration, has not only left us economically adrift, but also bearing difficult questions of identity. Have we truly been liberated? Or have we been stripped of our own mother country? Could we again find a place as part of a greater whole, or could we chart our own, independent, path?\n\nDifferent people have different answers. Those in urban areas, a significant portion of the population, benefitted from decades of Japanese occupation. Many are themselves ethnically Japanese, and many more consider themselves culturally so. Others, particularly in rural areas and among the indigenous population, instead endured oppression and exploitation at Japanese hands. Those experiences cannot be ignored.\n\nRecent events have created an opportunity to answer these questions once and for all. What will the people of Taiwan choose?"
 taiwan.1.a:0 "Send an envoy to Tokyo."
 taiwan.1.b:0 "Send an envoy to [china.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]."
 taiwan.1.c:0 "Petition [ROOT.Overlord.GetNameDef] to allow us to rejoin Japan."
 taiwan.1.d:0 "Petition [ROOT.Overlord.GetNameDef] to allow us to rejoin China."
 taiwan.1.e:0 "No, we should keep our independence!"

 taiwan.2.t:0 "Taiwan Seeks Union with [ROOT.GetNameDef]"
 taiwan.2.d.japan:0 "Once, Taiwan was our most prosperous colony, a model for the rest of the empire, a model for the rest of the world. Then, everything changed when our enemies attacked. Taiwan's separation brought not only economic turmoil, but it also saw the mass evacuation of Japanese nationals, and countless separated families. While we may no longer be the empire we once were, there are still many who long to see Taiwan become a part of Japan once again. Today, they may finally get what they have been waiting for.\n\nRecent events have conspired to make Taiwan's reunification a real possibility, and we have received a petition to that effect from [TAI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].\n\nWhat shall our answer be?"
 taiwan.2.d.china:0 "Once, Taiwan was a part of China, but everything changed when the Japanese attacked. For over forty years, Taiwan chafed under Japanese occupation, the victim of a power bent on remaking Asia in its own image. Although few but the oldest of the islands' inhabitants remembers the rule of our predecessors, we can be sure that for every one of those years, the people of Taiwan were secretly weaving Chinese flags, preparing for the day when we would inevitably return.\n\nHaving received a message from [TAI.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] requesting reunification, it seems today is to be that day."
 taiwan.2.a:0 "Welcome, brethren!"

 taiwan.3.t:0 "Taiwan Desires Union with [taiwan_union_target.GetNameDef]"
 taiwan.3.d:0 "Taiwan's recent separation from Japan, which brought to an end to over forty years of exchange and integration, not only left the island economically adrift, but also brought difficult questions of identity. It seems Taiwan has finally made a decision in that regard, as we have received a petition from [TAI.CApital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], verified by our consulate there, requesting reunification with [taiwan_union_target.GetNameDef]. Regardless of the island's inhabitants' preferences, as the victors, it is ultimately our choice to make."
 taiwan.3.a:0 "Of course."
 taiwan.3.b:0 "No, we prefer them kept separate."

 taiwan.4.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Approves Union with [taiwan_union_target.GetNameDef]"
 taiwan.4.d:0 "Good news! Our overlords in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] have approved our request to reunite with [taiwan_union_target.GetNameDef]!"
 taiwan.4.a:0 "Hooray!"

 taiwan.5.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Denies Union with [taiwan_union_target.GetNameDef]"
 taiwan.5.d:0 "Our overlords in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] have shown their true colors, and denied our request to reunite with [taiwan_union_target.GetNameDef]. Sadly, our small nation is but a small boat amid the powerful currents of international politics. For all the laws of nations, in the end, the strong eat up the weak."
 taiwan.5.a:0 "Damn them!"
