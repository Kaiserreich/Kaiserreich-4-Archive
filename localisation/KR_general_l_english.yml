### Name and Description ###
BM_HISTORY_TITLE:0 "Brief History"
KR_SCENARIO_NAME:0 "Legacy of the Weltkrieg"
KR_SCENARIO_DESC:0 "The year of 1936 is a turning point for the history of the world. A time of both great opportunity and great danger. Tensions between the German Empire and the Commune of France are growing, Russia and the USA are increasingly unstable and the old empires of Austria and Ottomans are dissolving. All the meanwhile Syndicalism, Totalism and Radical Socialism are spreading all around the world. Fifteen years have passed since the end of the Weltkrieg, and the old rivalries of yore have reappeared. A single spark may be all it takes to light the powder keg..."

### Major Nations ###

### Germany ###
GER_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In 1919, after five years of war, the German army finally overran the Entente defences in France. In 1921, Britain's surrender followed. The Weltkrieg has made Germany an uncontested World Power, yet things have been going downhill for her since the 1930s. A recessive world economy has dampened the nation's industrial output while other nations' manufacturing power recovers, and now nationalism grows in Germany's eastern client states, who are starting to drift away from the Reich. In 1936, Germany stands at a crossroads, and already we can see cracks in her mighty empire, as her ancestral enemies are regaining their former strength..."

#### Austria ###
#AUS_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "'Indivisible and Inseparable' - the aftermath of the Weltkrieg proved the Dual Monarchy to be otherwise. Despite standing amongst the victors, the war revealed the divisions of culture, class and ideology within the Empire, and the inner unrest continued on as the war ended. Kaiser Karl tried to reform the multinational Empire into something that could survive in the twentieth century and launched a series of large scale reforms. However, his efforts excluded the Hungarian side of the Empire, and the debacle that was the Illyrian Revolt only fuelled the tensions between the two halves. Whether Austria will hold, only time will tell..."

### Commune of France ###
FRA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The 3rd Republic ended in the way it began: defeated by German arms, and facing Revolution at home. In 1919, a General Strike was called by the CGT, causing the downfall of the bourgeois government. For 15 years, the new 'Commune of France' has united behind a common platform of Syndico-Socialist consensus, headed by the Comité de Salut Public. However, by 1936 the need to rebuild the country and defend the revolution is believed to be outdated by many critics and there is a growing call for more radical policies. France is confident in her mission, but it is unclear which revolutionary strands shall become dominant in the years to come..."

### Union of Britain ###
ENG_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After 1921's 'Peace with Honour' ended the Weltkrieg, the faith and support of the people in the Home Islands had disappeared. In 1925, disaster struck: a minor labour dispute quickly escalated into a General Strike called by the TUC, followed by military desertions to the strikers. After six weeks of rioting on a massive scale, the Royal Family and most of the country's elites were evacuated to Canada and instead, a new Congress of Trade Unions assumed political authority. The British people are currently content to build socialism in isolation, yet many are starting to think that the Monarchists in Canada cannot be allowed to plot against the Union indefinitely..."

### Canada ###
CAN_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the Revolution of 1925, the Royal Family and other British exiles found refuge in Canada. With the support of the Conservatives, they established a semi-official government in exile, in hopes of one day reclaiming the Home Islands. All is not well, however. RB Bennett's conservatives lost the 1935 election to Mackenzie King's Liberals, who, with a loose coalition of 'Progressives', now hold a slim majority in parliament and seek to assert Canadian parliamentary sovereignty against the growing power of the British Exiles and Crown. With the global political situation deteriorating, the stage is set for intense conflict both at home and abroad..."

### Russia ###
RUS_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "During Russia's Civil War, the White forces fought with all they had, but the Red Army still dominated the country's industrial heartland. The German empire however, fearing a red Russia, decided to intervene on behalf of the Whites. Two years later, Moscow and Petrograd fell to the White forces, and a new Russian Republic was established. For the past fifteen years, the leading parties, S-R and Kadets, have governed in an uneasy coalition under Kerensky, but Russia is becoming increasingly unstable. Other political forces are growing, and they are considering that it is now time for change, so that the country may reassert her power in the world..."

### United States ###
USA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The USA almost left their policy of isolation to intervene in the Weltkrieg, but ultimately kept out of the war. This lead to a victory of the Central Powers. Since then, the USA has struggled economically, European trade opportunities, and the repayment of their loans to the Entente have been made impossible by a German victory. Still internationally regarded as a 'nobody', she now faces mounting internal dissent as the Republican-Democratic hegemony is challenged by two groups - the Syndicalists and the America First Union. With a mounting crisis at home and only a modest reputation overseas, things aren't looking good for the United States of America..."

### Japan ###
JAP_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "While the 'Peace with Honour' guaranteed Japanese rule over the colonies, not all was well in the Empire of the Rising Sun. After a period of economic upheaval culminated in a Syndicalist attempt on the life of Prince-Regent Hirohito in 1926, unstable governments followed one another in a year of crisis; First General Tanaka, then the democratic Coalition Cabinet and an intervention in Northeast China. In 1936, Japan is poised to extend her empire. With Germany's dominance appearing to be in decline, the Japanese look hungrily at the remaining Qing territories and the German pacific possessions..."

### Minor Nations ###

### Australasia ###
AST_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Nearly two decades after the Weltkrieg, Australasia still hasn't healed. Unbelievable, catastrophic manpower losses and sacrifices in the Weltkrieg all for naught have led to an atmosphere of cynicism and hopelessness as the once-great British Empire crumbled to pieces. The economy is a complete dumpster fire, a natural consequence of the fall of the United Kingdom and the ensuing loss of exports that followed. The shadow of the syndicalist Melbourne Commune still haunts the continent, but there are still plenty who haven't forgotten the Empire and are ready to reclaim its birthright..."

### Bulgaria ###
BUL_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Upon the conclusion of the Weltkrieg, the Tsardom of Bulgaria had found itself standing amongst the victors of the war in relatively good shape. Having proved its military skill and secured all of its territorial ambitions, Bulgaria had found herself in a golden age with a hegemony over the Balkans. Following Malinov's rise to power as Prime Minister in 1927, the nation had begun to distance itself from Germany and had been forced to rely on itself and what few allies it had. Despite all of this, issues within Bulgaria are still largely prevalent, with the nation having an ailing economy due to a lack of outside trade alongside costly military pensions..."

### Egypt ###
EGY_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "As a protectorate of the British Empire, Egypt was forced to side with the Entente in the Weltkrieg. Yet with the signing of the Peace with Honour, the anger of the Egyptians would simmer until the British Revolution in 1925 erupted. In the Chaos, the Egyptian people launched their own liberal revolution to throw out the British, lead by the Sultan of Egypt. As 1936 arrives, the Sultanate's eyes fall increasingly upon the Young Farouk, the young heir being groomed for the throne, and with the decline of Ottoman power, members of all political parties began to wonder and plan to restore the might of Egypt; dreaming of an Ottoman Free Middle-East..."

### Greece ###
GRE_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Stuff..."

### The Netherlands ###
HOL_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "While preserving neutrality in Europe, the Netherlands faced all the fiercer challenges in their colonies. The Insulindian Independence movement grows bolder by the day, and the grand days of the Dutch Navy are long gone. And even in Europe, things could be better; the Netherlands have always had a special relationship with Germany, particularly economically – which means the rising economic problems in Germany could extend to the Low Countries. And all of this comes at a time in which a rising number of the Dutch people falter over French syndicalism or the dreams of a Greater Netherlands..."

### Persia ###
PER_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Sublime State of Iran, although not directly involved in the Weltkrieg, still bears scars from its past. The Famine of 1919, a product of British and Russian occupation, led to the deaths of millions of Iranian citizens; the years since marred by tribal revolutions and an attempted assassination of the Shah, who survived, but lies on death's doorstep. If his time comes, a power struggle is inevitable, and Republicans, Socialists and Royalists alike may try to seize power for themselves. Whatever the outcome, many look to the future with hope that someday Iran will once again return to regional hegemony..."

### The Republic of Italy ###
ITA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After Italy lost everything in the Weltkrieg due to what can only be called horrific incompetence, the cowardly Savoyard kings fled the country and allowed the Austrians to impose a 'federation' led by a puppet Archduke in Modena. From the ashes, the Republic was proclaimed; but French lapdogs divided the revolution between Democratic and Syndicalist principles. After much bloodshed, an uneasy border at the Po river was established, but Italy controls very little of the the former Kingdom. Now, as crisis and war loom, so do opportunities for Italy to rise from its ashes like a phoenix, no matter the cost..."

### Two Sicilies ###
SIC_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was never meant to be independent, but rather a member of the Italian Federation that would supplant the Kingdom. In the chaos of the Civil War, only brave Sicily stood firm against the Syndicalist tide, and its timely help saved the Holy See from a grizzly fate at the hands of anarchists. Over the last 20 years, much has changed, and economic growth and stability have allowed the Kingdom to enjoy a relative state of peace despite the ever-present threat in the North. However, as Germany and Austria weaken and the Syndicalist vultures grow bold, and war again looms over the Mezzogiorno..."

### German East Asia###
GEA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since the British collapse in 1926, the Kaiserliche Marine has been an undisputed master of the Eastern Seas, and the guardian of the western order in the Orient. The retreat of the British 'China Station' to Australasia left her Asian colonies and concessions vulnerable to insurrection, and in need of protection only Germany could offer, completing a string of colonies and concessions from Suez to Tsingtau. However, Deutsch-Ostasien exists not as a colony, but instead as a jurisdiction; a stretch of territory in which the admiralty must balance local interests, contend with varying colonial systems, and ensure the protection of it all..."

#### Ethiopia ###
#ETH_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Abyssinia was one of the only countries in Africa to remain independent during the Scramble for Africa after successfully defeated an Italian invasion in 1896 in the Battle of Adwa. An ally of Germany in the last stages of the Weltkrieg, it seized Eritrea back from Italy at a great cost, while proving to observers it's army was incapable of modern war. The massive debt contracted in the war and the years shortly after still cripples the Empire and the reformist goals of the new Emperor, Halie Selassie. Slavery and other backwards institutions stand in the way of a modern, reborn Ethiopia. The King of Kings has difficult choices ahead of him."
#
##### Liberia ###
#LBR_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Liberia is an independent West African nation under the protection of the United States of America. Secret Societies, such as Poro for the lower classes and the Masonic Order of Liberia at the top ensure that the rich stay rich, and the poor can govern themselves from behind a mask of secrecy. During the Revolution in Britain, Sierra Leone was occupied and then annexed by France. The wave of Leonese refugees was exceeded by the Ivorian refugees later. Now Liberia is engulfed by debt from failed projects, and her future uncertain. Will President Edwin Barclay, a legitimist in the TWP, be able to save Liberia from disaster?."
#
#### Mittelafrika ###
#MAF_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Born after the absorption of French and Belgian colonies, the Freistadt Mittelafrika is a massive swath of land, composed of Cities, Chiefdoms, Kingdoms, Farmlands, Jungles, Savannahs, Deserts and more; for it covers half of the Dark Continent. A complex web weave of treaties, agreements and tacit understandings, the Colony, while stable, is remarkably unprofitable; something that the new man in charge, Hermann von Göring, and his men wish to change, no matter the cost. But could that cost be too great for Mittelafrika to pay? And will the Kaiser allow Göring to take such a risk?"
#
#### Norway ###
#NOR_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Norway pursued a policy of neutrality during the Weltkrieg and remained in the British sphere of influence after peace was signed in 1921. Its dependence on the United Kingdom would prove to be disastrous when the British revolution of 1925 threw the Norwegian economy into chaos. Unlike its neighbours, Norway is not a member of the German 'Reichspakt' and the resulting lack of continental trade has prevented an economic recovery. As the public is slowly losing confidence in democracy, both syndicalists and nationalists are calling for radical solutions and the election of 1936 is rapidly approaching..."
#
#### Portugal ###
#POR_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Portugal was restructured in 1922, after the disaster that was the Republic and the great shame it brought to the nation. Under the political control of the Intgralists since 1926, the Year of the Second Ultimatum, tense border incidents with Mittelafrika are commonplace, and three different offers to buy Angola and Mozambique were refused, for the King and his government consider every inch of overseas land a proper part of the Realm. While close to the Entente, Portugal still needs to renew its treaties with Great Britain, for the Syndicalist threat looms over Europe, and dark clouds gather over Spain..."
#
#### Serbia ###
#SER_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Being the catalyst for the Weltkrieg, the war proved disastrous for Serbia. Until the 1920s the country was under Austrian military occupation, when it was reestablished as a rump state. The country has kept a low profile, knowing that trying to retake any of the lost land would result in the wrath of Austria-Hungary. While officially a kingdom, Petar Bojovic has ruled Serbia for almost two decades as regent. Now though, the situation is changing. Romania and Greece are looking to regain their lost territory from Bulgaria, and with the 1937 Ausgleich negotiations in Austria, Serbia might be able to finally reassert herself as an independent power..."
#
#### Somalia ###
#SOM_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Somalia was born out of the Weltkrieg, as the different protectorates of Italy rallied under the flag of Warsangali by the war's end. While nominally a federation with its capital at Mogadishu, much power emanates from Las Khorey. The legal limbo of the federation is unnerving and meet with criticism from the youth and army officers. The transformations in the economy that independence brought, such as railroads and factories and well armed military forces, contrast with famines and the traditional way of the rural areas. But this prosperity might not last, for Abyssinia's gaze turns towards the Ogaden, and war fast approaches..."
#
#### South Africa ###
#SAF_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Formed in 1910 as a merger of the various British possessions in South Africa, the Union of South Africa is currently a parliamentary republic, having seceded from the British Empire during the crisis of 1925. The National Party's victory in the last election has them poised to increase restrictions on the country's black majority, amidst rising tensions and a growing opposition from the Dominion Party which advocates a return to the British Empire. It is expected the issue will finally be resolved come the 1938 elections - though many fear the result will almost inevitably be violence, if not civil war."
#
#### Switzerland ###
#SWI_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Something something neutrality something something"
#
#### National France ###
#NFA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Fleeing the new Commune of France, the whole apparatus of state and French military, embarked with the Navy to Algiers in 1919. Here, the politicians decided to start from scratch again, and thus proclaiming the Fourth Republic in exile but while still claiming the motherland and still allied with the British. Soon, with most of the refugees being either nationalist, authoritarian, or both, the military seized power under the leadership of Ferdinand Foch followed by the victor of Verdun, Philippe Pétain. Will National France be ready to retake the motherland despite the discontentment of the natives - maybe helped by the young guard of de Gaulle..."
#
#### Japan ###
#JAP_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "While the 'Peace with Honour' guaranteed Japanese rule over the colonies, not all was well in the Empire of the Rising Sun. After a period of economic upheaval culminated in a Syndicalist attempt on the life of Prince-Regent Hirohito in 1926, unstable governments followed one another in a year of crisis; First General Tanaka, then the democratic Coalition Cabinet and an intervention in Northeast China. In 1936, Japan is poised to extend her empire. With Germany's dominance appearing to be in decline, the Japanese look hungrily at the remaining Qing territories and the German pacific possessions..."
#
#### Ottoman Empire ###
#OTT_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Ottoman Army had begun to collapse by 1918 and seemed likely to surrender. With the fall of France however, Germany was finally free to send troops to the collapsing Ottoman fronts. The British were quickly driven out of Baghdad and Jerusalem, and the Central Powers soon reached the Suez Canal. Ever triumphant, the Ottomans gained Cyprus and a set of puppet governments in the peace of 1921; but still the Empire remained unindustrialised and in desperate need of reform. However, all is not yet lost. The political situation in Europe is rapidly changing, and many opportunities beckon. Will the 'Sick man of Europe' finally recover?"
#
#### Netherlands ###
#HOL_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "While preserving neutrality in Europe, the Netherlands faced all the fiercer challenges in their colonies. The Indonesian Independence movement grows bolder by the day, and the grand days of the Dutch Navy are long gone. And even in Europe, things could be better; the Netherlands have always had a special relationship with Germany, particularly economically – which means the rising economic problems in Germany could extend to the Low Countries. And all of this comes at a time in which a rising number of the Dutch people falter over French syndicalism or the dreams of a Greater Netherlands..."
#
#### Mexico ###
#MEX_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Mexico has been reigned over by a coalition of former enemies, Alvaro Obregon and Emiliano Zapata, for the last years. Obregon initiated major reconstructions plans to alleviate the damage of the civil war, while Zapatas land reform redistributed nearly 45 million acres of arable land to the peasantry. Zapata was then elected president in 1932, but despite his great progress so far, the next presidential election remains a mystery. Pancho Villa, supported by Zapata, is the favourite, but the Totalist Plutarco Calles may cause some surprises. And while the question of socialisation of foreign ownership remains, the USA have been plunged into turmoil..."
#
#### Delhi ###
#DEH_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Too little and too late, the Anglo-Indian Treaty of 1925 could not bind the Jewel to the Empire. After the Revolution in the homelands, the leadership of the Indian National Congress convened a provisional government in Calcutta. In the confusion of the ensuing civil war, the southern princes rebelled from the Delhi government, prolonging the civil war until 1928. The uneasy truce between the three Indias – the Syndicalist Bharatiya Commune, the Princely federation in the South and the Entente-loyal Delhi government - has held since then, but all three seem to be gathering steam for a new round of conflict over the legacy of the late British Raj..."
#
#### Brazil ###
#BRA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The terrible wounds of the 1927 civil war may never heal, but Brazil marches towards progress, even if at it's own pace. Secret Voting and increased state autonomy were the main achievements of the conflict that ensured that true democracy finally reached the people of Brazil, and it's economy finally begins to recover from a decade of downturn. With the game of politics radically changed, came new players; civil unrest brought Syndicalism and Integralism to mainstream politics, as the coalition led by Otávio Mangabeira struggles to keep order in the streets, continue to develop the nation, and keep up on it's expensive dreadnaught race with Argentina and Chile.
#
#### Romanian ###
#ROM_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After Romania was defeated in the Weltkrieg, the country was forced to sign the Treaty of Bucharest in 1918. The southern part of Dobrogea was returned to Bulgaria, Oltenia was de-militarised, and the oilfields were leased to Germany until 2012. When the king died after the war, the military took over the country. Eventually their collaboration with far-right parties would result in the violent take-over of the nationalist Iron Guard in 1935. Lead by the charismatic Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, the new government looks to restore Romania to its former greatness, while also having to deal with the supporters of the monarchy, who want to oust the new regime..."

### History ###
OTHER_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are waiting for their turn to rise as a major player of this world. From major powers trying to keep their empires to the many nations trying to regain what they lost in the Weltkrieg, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world..."

### Generic Focuses ###
generic_army_effort:0 "Modern Warfare"
generic_army_effort_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg, from its start to its end, changed warfare forever by finally ending Napoleonic Warfare's grasp on military thought and confirming the extreme deadliness of the rifle, machine gun and artillery cannon. Our army must adapt or perish, in a literal sense."
generic_equipment_effort:0 "Equipment Modernisation"
generic_equipment_effort_desc:0 "For a long time, military breakthroughs were slow, and having a good bolt-action rifle was enough. However, these rifles of the 19th Century are completely out of place on post-Weltkrieg battlefield. We must stop being complacent and get new equipment."
generic_motorization_effort:0 "Army Motorisation"
generic_motorization_effort_desc:0 "The cavalry charges of the Weltkrieg were probably the last. The truck is no longer just a transport tool and rapidly integrates to mobile warfare tactics. We must shake off outdated thinking and use motorisation to speed up our offensives and reinforcements."
generic_doctrine_effort:0 "Studying the Weltkrieg"
generic_doctrine_effort_desc:0 "We know about the Weltkrieg, but what have we learned from it? In just five years of conflict, countless soldiers died to teach us the new dynamics of warfare. If we do not learn about them, then our soldiers will meet the same fate on the battlefield."
generic_equipment_effort_2:0 "Equipment Research"
generic_equipment_effort_2_desc:0 "We might have caught up to modern equipment, but new designs are already making ours obsolete. Regardless, we must persevere, and make sure that we never fall a single year behind in equipment. This means we will have to start developing our own designs."
generic_mechanization_effort:0 "Mechanised Warfare"
generic_mechanization_effort_desc:0 "Trucks fared poorly on the frontlines, but it seems that we can now meet halfway between trucks and tanks. Armoured personal carriers can bring troops directly into combat, shield them from fire, and even provide powerful fire support if needed."
generic_doctrine_effort_2:0 "Military Exercises"
generic_doctrine_effort_2_desc:0 "Every great power exercises, and so should we. War games are more than peacetime entertainment for generals, they allow us to test both true and tested and revolutionary tactics without wasting countless lives. This allows us to complete our theoretical discoveries."
generic_equipment_effort_3:0 "Equipment Breakthroughs"
generic_equipment_effort_3_desc:0 "We have come to such an experience in equipment research that we are no longer limited to eternally catching up or buying foreign equipment to get cutting-edge military gear. Even great powers may soon be surprised by what will soon be in our soldiers' hands."
generic_armor_effort:0 "Armoured Warfare"
generic_armor_effort_desc:0 "Tanks are the pinnacle of modern warfare. Mobile vehicles armed with cannons worthy of artillery, and impervious to the average rifle. Even if we only produce few, we will plow through our enemies with judicious use of those steel behemoths."
generic_special_forces:0 "Special Forces"
generic_special_forces_desc:0 "Special Forces are more than the Elite Units of old. With modern equipment, even a conscript can hold his own on the battlefield. However, some situations are so hostile that they need specially trained men. Mountain ranges, amphibious landings, airborne assaults."

generic_aviation_effort:0 "National Airforce"
generic_aviation_effort_tt:0 "Not enough building slots for §YAir Base§!"
generic_aviation_effort_desc:0 "The field of aviation was born almost in time for the Weltkrieg. Even two decades after this war, it is still new, and all nations strive to be ready for the next time their planes may be called to war. We must, too. We must found a solid Airforce to organise them."
generic_fighter_focus:0 "Air Superiority"
generic_fighter_focus_desc:0 "The dogfights of the Weltkrieg were merely the start of air-to-air warfare. As planes become faster, more armoured and more heavily armed, we need to put all our efforts into making sure we control the air. Then, striking the ground is a formality."
generic_bomber_focus:0 "Strategic Bombing"
generic_bomber_focus_desc:0 "Even when they were brand new, bombers inspired fear, and many saw their potential. As payloads get larger and bigger, even the artillery barrages of the Weltkrieg fail to compare. Some day, we may even surpass them, and destroy entire cities or regions in one run."
generic_aviation_effort_2:0 "Modern Air Tactics"
generic_aviation_effort_2_desc:0 "Planes have long stopped being just reconnaissance and harassment tools. By integrating them fully into our army operations, the airforce is capable of dealing as much damage and advancing our operations as much as the average Army Command."
generic_CAS_effort:0 "Close Air Support"
generic_CAS_effort_desc:0 "While Fighters and Bombers can indirectly affect the battle, dedicated CAS planes have both the agility and armament needed to perform strafe and bombing runs on ground targets, causing major damage on unprepared armies while handling decently in aerial combat."
generic_rocket_effort:0 "Experimental Rocketry"
generic_rocket_effort_desc:0 "The field of rocketry is perhaps one of the newest fields of military science. If our scientists are to be believed, rocket engines can achieve speeds that would put radial engines to shame. Some say they could go even faster than sound, certainly extremely exciting."
generic_NAV_effort:0 "Naval Aviation"
generic_NAV_effort_desc:0 "Perhaps one of the major breakthroughs in naval warfare, naval bombers are able to lay waste on enemy fleets with torpedoes and other dedicated naval payloads like mines. Supporting our fleets, they can challenge capital ships and wreck havoc in the naval screens."

generic_naval_effort:0 "Modern Dockyards"
generic_naval_effort_tt:0 "Not enough building slots for §YNaval Dockyards§!"
generic_naval_effort_desc:0 "If we are to establish a strong navy, we need to produce it first. Shipbuilding methods have evolved, and old drydocks need to be upgraded as much as new dockyards must be built from scratch. The modern ship is no cog, and we must see big to have a sea-worthy fleet."
generic_flexible_navy:0 "Flexible Tactics"
generic_flexible_navy_desc:0 "We will never have the navies of the world powers, able to clean entire seas of opposition, but this does not mean our fleet will hide in port. Using flexible tactics and modern inventions like submarines, we do not need to actually match up with those grand fleets to wreck havoc."
generic_large_navy:0 "Power Projection"
generic_large_navy_desc:0 "Our navy might not yet be able to contest the bigger navies of this world, but by picking our fights smartly and keeping our fleets focused, we can make sure that any confrontation is in our advantage while still retaining a powerful navy that can rout weaker navies."
generic_submarine_effort:0 "Submarine Warfare"
generic_submarine_effort_desc:0 "Submarine warfare is the most exciting naval development since the invention of the torpedo boat, and challenges even the most classical doctrines of naval warfare. We would do well to not just protect against submarines, but also use them against enemy ships."
generic_cruiser_effort:0 "Screen Ships"
generic_cruiser_effort_desc:0 "Cruisers are not just 'cheap Battleships', and such outdated thinking ruins the potential of those ships. We should use them as escorts to our capital ships, as they are very vulnerable to naval bombers and smaller ships like torpedo boats."
generic_destroyer_effort:0 "Anti-Submarine Warfare"
generic_destroyer_effort_desc:0 "By studying the design and strategic use of submarines, we also learn how to counter them. Our Destroyers will need specialised equipment like depth charges and specific designs that are both light and small to ensure they can escort convoys and patrol efficiently."
generic_capital_ships_effort:0 "Capital Ships"
generic_capital_ships_effort_desc:0 "Eventually, a fleet is nothing without a centrepiece, and both the old Battleship and modern Carrier fit this role. While vulnerable in a direct confrontation, they can bring massive damage upon enemy fleets if we let them shell and swarm the enemy ships from a safe distance."

generic_industrial_effort:0 "Industrial Methods"
generic_industrial_effort_desc:0 "To construct a large industrial base, we will need to set up the basics of modern industry, and maybe even make initial choices. Concentrated or dispersed industrial centres, investing in machine tools and construction tools. All of those are important things to focus on."
generic_construction_effort:0 "Industrial Grants"
generic_construction_effort_tt:0 "Not enough building slots for §YCivilian Factories§!"
generic_construction_effort_desc:0 "A healthy and strong industry doesn't just appear out of nowhere. While we may have to start more ambitious projects later, we must start by ensuring that those with good management skills can start healthy, successful companies that may later grow into giants."
generic_production_effort:0 "State Armouries"
generic_production_effort_tt:0 "Not enough building slots for §YMilitary Factory§!"
generic_production_effort_desc:0 "Until we are able to produce our own military equipment, we should create modern armouries for our army. Their goal is quite modest, procuring the gear our army needs using state funds, civilian production and simple production, but it is better than not getting any new rifles."
generic_construction_effort_2:0 "Industrial Centres"
generic_construction_effort_2_desc:0 "Entrepreneurship is one thing, but to have an economy worthy of even a regional power, we will need to foster the large industrial regions that made the Industrial Revolution. The seeds of such regions are large investment into promising industrial sites."
generic_production_effort_2:0 "Military Manufactures"
generic_production_effort_2_desc:0 "We must produce our own military equipment if we want our army to be more than a reserve force. The only way to do so is to heavily fund the creation of dedicated military manufactures, and support them with regular contracts and promises to ensure they can stay afloat."
generic_production_effort_3:0 "Military Industry"
generic_production_effort_3_desc:0 "We have finally reached a point where we have companies able to build the equipment we need, even if their output is still limited. However, our needs are still great, and by giving them absolute support over foreign companies they will slowly scale up to our needs."
generic_infrastructure_effort:0 "National Infrastructure"
generic_infrastructure_effort_desc:0 "Our growing industry requires a solid infrastructure to ensure the transit of goods. We need to do away with chaotic, city to city planning and finally draw the roads of our country. Those who exist, those who will be expanded or linked, and those that have yet to be."
generic_infrastructure_effort_tt:0 "Not enough building slots for §YInfrastructure§!"
generic_synth_oil_effort_tt:0 "Not enough building slots for §YSynthetic Refinery§!"
generic_infrastructure_effort_2:0 "Railway Networks"
generic_infrastructure_effort_2_desc:0 "Modern countries need railway networks, able to bring anything from one point of the country to another rapidly and efficiently. This means we will have to expand our railways and create junctions that didn't occur to us even a few years ago."
generic_construction_effort_3:0 "Industrial Networks"
generic_construction_effort_3_desc:0 "Much like roads and railways, industries are connected in large, sprawling networks, based on input and output, import and export. As our infrastructure improves, so do these links, and our industry grows stronger as they can rely on the economy of our few wealthy provinces."

generic_extra_tech_slot:0 "Research Councils"
generic_extra_tech_slot_desc:0 "Our industrial growth has attracted many learned minds, both nationals and foreign scientists looking for employment. We should fund research councils to ensure that they find tasks to work on, until our industrial base grows enough that we attract private research institutes."
generic_extra_tech_slot_2:0 "Research Institutes"
generic_extra_tech_slot_2_desc:0 "As our industrial base expands, we finally go from just manufacturing to actually designing and creating, or at least attracting those who do. Those research institutes have not only the minds, but also the funds to make discoveries. Let us waste no time encouraging their implantation."
generic_technology_sharing:0 "Technology Sharing"
generic_technology_sharing_desc:0 "By sharing technological advances with our allies, our whole faction will be able to conduct wartime research and development more efficiently. Of course, we will need to prove our help is impactful to them, but once this much is proved, we stand to benefit greatly from their research."
generic_secret_weapons:0 "Secret Weapons"
generic_secret_weapons_desc:0 "It is tempting to expend all extra resources into just developing tanks and planes, but the secret to winning wars lies in whole new fields of science; electronics, rocketry and nuclear research. Just because we are not a major power, does not mean we cannot make our own strides in those fields."

generic_political_effort:0 "Political Reform"
generic_political_effort_desc:0 "To bring about change in the world, we need to be able to bring about change in our own country. Strengthening our political position should come first, we need to do away with old political doctrine and be ready to adopt bold, ambitious views on how our nation is to be ruled from now on."
generic_collectivist_ethos_kr:0 "Unite The Nation"
generic_collectivist_ethos_kr_desc:0 "This era is a strange one, with the rise of Syndicalism, the fragile position of Democracy and the maintained Authoritarian old order. We must protect our country from outside influences by ensuring our people believe in the founding values of our country, least we are washed away by opposing views."
generic_militarism:0 "Militarism"
generic_militarism_desc:0 "Those who view the military as a necessary evil are doomed to hesitate in the face of war. We will ingrain militarism into our culture to become a people of soldiers, if not an army with a state. If one thing is certain since the Weltkrieg, it is that it might very well not have been The War To End War."
generic_military_youth:0 "Military Youth"
generic_military_youth_desc:0 "Organisations to promote discipline and political education of young people in our nation will foster loyalty and self-sacrifice early in a citizen's life. These core values must be learned from the most tender age, so that the next generations are ready to fight for our country."
generic_ideological_fanaticism:0 "Ideological Fanaticism"
generic_ideological_fanaticism_desc:0 "Our politically established values and goals are worth dying for as much as any ancient faith. Any follower should be prepared to face death, and those who stray better be prepared to face death. There is no middle ground in this ideological struggle of the great and small powers alike."
generic_liberty_ethos_kr:0 "Spirit Of Freedom"
generic_liberty_ethos_kr_desc:0 "Freedom is not just a happy happenstance, it is something that must be preserved against tyranny. The Weltkrieg and the rise of Syndicalism has to many put this spirit in doubt, but no nation is too small to rekindle its flame in their governments and populaces and ward against those trying to extinguish it."
generic_rights_of_man:0 "The Rights Of Man"
generic_rights_of_man_desc:0 "The Rights Of Man is perhaps the founding act of the modern Democracy, doing away with the feudal order and ensuring equal rights for all. There have always been the odd doubts about our stance on those essential rights, and we will dispel them without ambiguity. We only stand to benefit from it."
generic_liberty_research:0 "University Grants"
generic_liberty_research_desc:0 "The modern University is a great achievement, allowing people of even modest origin to elevate themselves via higher learning. However, this requires us to fund university grants to allow such access to poorer but aspiring students. Let's make that move now, these future scholars will pay dividends."
generic_welfare:0 "Welfare Programs"
generic_welfare_desc:0 "Equality in rights and equality in education are two important milestones, but economic equality is perhaps the hardest. While we might never reach a perfect equality in this area, we can at least prop up the poorest in our country with fair welfare programs. This ought to help our consumer economy speed up, too."
generic_national_identity:0 "National Identity"
generic_national_identity_desc:0 "While the ideological debate is one we could get lost in for ages, we must not forget who we are at our core. We are unique, we know our history, our culture and we hope that our destiny is even more brilliant. If we have shaped a better society today, we will shape an even better country tomorrow."

### Generic Ideas ###
generic_liberty_idea:0 "Spirit Of Freedom"
generic_liberty_idea_desc:0 "Freedom is something we have pledged to preserve, and this inspires our population to support us even if they may not always agree with our policies or the state of the country in the present moment."
generic_militarism_focus:0 "Militarism"
generic_militarism_focus_desc:0 "Our people have come to see the army as an integral part of our nation, and every conscript plays his part. This allows us to mobilise reserves, militia and other paramilitary forces in a pinch."
generic_military_youth_focus:0 "Military Youth"
generic_military_youth_focus_desc:0 "From the youngest age, our citizens learn military values and integrate them as a part of their life. This obviously increases the amount of vocations for the army as they reach adulthood."
generic_ideological_fanaticism_focus:0 "Ideological Fanaticism"
generic_ideological_fanaticism_focus_desc:0 "Our country is the centre of our ideology, and our ideology is the fabric of country. Many are ready to die for its survival when others would easily retreat to new positions."
generic_liberty_research_idea:0 "University Grants"
generic_liberty_research_idea_desc:0 "We are paying modest but still relatively decent university grants to ensure any aspiring student has a shot at higher education. This is bound to increase the size of our intelligentsia"
generic_welfare_idea:0 "Welfare Programs"
generic_welfare_idea_desc:0 "We are ensuring that the poorest in our society receive the help they need to survive, so that they do not have to fend for themselves and may work for our economy one day."
