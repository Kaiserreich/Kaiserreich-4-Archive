POLITICS_PETR_KRASNOV_DESC:0 "The Krasnov Clan is perhaps the most famous among the Don Cossacks, its members have been generals, officers and intellectuals, and Pyetr Krasnov was just the most recent manifestation of this heritage. Though raised as a Cossack, Krasnov is extremely well read - he holds great interest in literature and writes fiction, has studied the nations of the Far East and Africa while serving in the Life Guards Ataman Regiment, and was even an acquaintance of Tsar Nikolay II himself. Having risen to lead the Regiment, he swore fealty to the Provisional Government, but did not hold warm feelings towards it, and so chose to not save Kerensky during the October Revolution. When he arrived back to his home in the Don Host, he was elected their Ataman and announced a crusade against the revolution in the north.\n\nThe Don Cossacks would prove to be the most loyal and effective force among the South Russian Whites, and periodically received German support, which the Ataman did not forget. Once the Bolshevik revolution concluded, Krasnov returned to his Host, but the Republic in Moscow did not leave him satisfied. The Tsar was nowhere close to being restored, the Republic itself was weak, and Krasnov personally despised Kerensky. During the Kolchak Coup of 1925, he decided to strike. Supported by German arms and a clique of loyal officers, he organized his own putsch in Rostov-on-Don, moved onto the rest of the Don-Caucasian region, and cut all ties with the regime in Moscow. The Kaiser's support meant that Russia was forced to back down, although it claims the region to this day. Krasnov continues to run the clique as a personalistic regime, suppressing all of Kuban Host's calls for union with Ukraine and keeping the North Caucasian tribes down. For now."

### Events ###
dkb.1.t:0 "The Don-Kuban Union"
dkb.1.d:0 "The Don-Kuban Union was proclaimed by Pyetr Krasnov on the 18th of May 1918, when he was elected as the 'Ataman' ('Leader') of the Don Cossacks. Since then, Krasnov, who used to be a connecting link between the leadership of the White Army and the Germans, started to strengthen his regime in South Russia by improving his relations with the separatist leaders of the Kuban and Terek Cossacks. With the German help, Don-Kuban Union could finally break away from Russia, which Krasnov as the Ataman of the Union condemned for its new republican system using the conservative and pro-monarchist feelings of the South Russian population.\n\nHowever, the newly established nation still has to face with lots of problems. The lack of modern industry weakens the army, the people want land redistribution and reunification with Russia while separatist tensions in various parts of the Caucasus grow. If Pyetr Krasnov wants to stay as the Ataman of the Don-Kuban Union, he will have to deal with all these problems in his country."
dkb.1.a:0 "Krasnov should bring an order to the Union."

dkb.2.t:0 "Cossack Circle"
dkb.2.d:0 "'Kazachiy Krug' ('Cossack Circle') is the main legislative and executive state authority in Don-Kuban Union. The member of this 'Krug' represents the Russians, Don, Kuban and Terek Cossacks, the Kalmyks, the Chechens, and other minorities in our country. This authority has a right to discuss almost every significant question, which has relation to the life in the country. Though Krasnov can promulgate his orders even without the approval of the 'Krug', he still has to consider its opinion in case if he wants to retain control over the Union."
dkb.2.a:0 "This 'Krug' is surely very important."

dkb.3.t:0 "Berlin Stock Crisis comes to Don-Kuban"
dkb.3.d:0 "As predicted, the Union's finances and economy are in deep crisis. The average denizen faces problems selling his products and a number of factories are closing. This means that various dangerous elements will have a greater impact upon the political landscape of the Cossack country."
dkb.3.a:0 "May God save us from the worst effects..."

dkb.4.t:0 "Initial stabilisation"
dkb.4.d:0 "With the first wave of the crisis slowly passing by, some less affected branches of the economy have bounced off the bottom. Still, the overall state of our economy does not look optimistic yet..."
dkb.4.a:0 "Let's hope stabilisation will come soon."

dkb.5.t:0 "Further stabilisation"
dkb.5.d:0 "The economy continues to regain its pre-crisis efficiency."
dkb.5.a:0 "Keep it up!"

dkb.6.t:0 "Illegal Trade Union Founded"
dkb.6.d:0 "We have found yet another secret trade union in one of our factories. Workers have united in order to demand higher wages and better workplace safety standards. We must blame the spread of syndicalist propaganda for this!"
dkb.6.a:0 "Allow them to operate but keep a close watch on these workers."
dkb.6.b:0 "Disband the union and arrest the workers!"

dkb.7.t:0 "Ukrainian Language in the Kuban Region"
dkb.7.d:0 "The Ukrainian officials, who once tried to include Kuban region with our capital Yekaterinodar into Ukraine but were stopped by Krasnov and the local Cossack and White armies, haven't stop their attempts to gain influence in our country. This time, the Ukrainians propose us to acknowledge Ukrainian language as the second official language in Kuban. They have support from some members of the Kuban Cossacks in the 'Krug', who hope that the Ukrainian help will allow them to strengthen their positions within our country.\n\nOn the contrary, the Don Cossacks reject any agreement with the Ukrainians as the Kingdom of Ukraine occupied a large part of the Don lands at the end of the Russian civil war."
dkb.7.a:0 "The Don Cossacks are right - we should reclaim our lands!"
dkb.7.b:0 "Make a compromise - the Ukrainians can fund some schools in the Kuban."
dkb.7.c:0 "Ukrainian language shall be the second language in the Kuban region!"

dkb.8.t:0 "Land Redistribution in Stavropol"
dkb.8.d:0 "The Stavropol region has the Russian majority, but the Kalmyks, who live in the Steppes near the Caspian Sea, claimed that some of these lands in Stavropol should become a part of Kalmykia.\n\nOn the other end, the Russians believe that the Kalmyks took lots of their peasant's land in Stavropol during the civil war. In order to balance things out,we must launch a land redistribution campaign in the northern part of Stavropol region. How should we proceed with this issue?"
dkb.8.a:0 "The Russians are right - give these lands back to them."
dkb.8.b:0 "We won't start any land redistribution program!"
dkb.8.c:0 "The Kalmyks shall get their new lands!"

dkb.9.t:0 "Sharia Courts in Chechnya"
dkb.9.d:0 "The Terek river divides the lands of the Terek Cossacks in the North and the Chechen lands in the South. The Chechens has asked us to allow them to practice Sharia law and have Sharia courts within their territory.\n\nHowever, Terek Cossacks feared that this decision will lead to radicalisation within this region and new wave of clashes between local Cossacks and Chechens. In their view, the Cossacks should have the right to arrest any radical Muslim priests who tried to use rules of Islam on non-believers in the Chechen region. We have to give them our answer."
dkb.9.a:0 "The Cossacks shall bring order to Chechnya!"
dkb.9.b:0 "We are a Secular State, only the state authorities shall have the ability to arrest lawbreakers."
dkb.9.c:0 "The Chechens can use their Sharia law - it is a Muslim tradition..."
